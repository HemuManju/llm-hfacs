    "AnalysisNarrative": "The noninstrument-rated pilot departed into night conditions with three passengers. Flight track information indicated that the helicopter flew northwest at altitudes between about 350 and 700 ft before impacting wooded terrain about 2.5 miles from the departure point. The helicopter was heavily fragmented, and the wreckage path was about 225 ft long. The examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any preimpact mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\nAtmospheric conditions were favorable to the development of widespread, dense radiational fog in the area of the accident site during the time the helicopter departed. The pilot was aware of these conditions, as he stated to an individual before he departed that the fog and visibility were “bad,” and that he needed to find another way home. The helicopter was not certified for instrument flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the pilot maneuvered the helicopter into reduced visibility, night conditions, it is likely he could not see outside visual references. When there is a lack of outside visual references, the pilot would have to use his flight instruments to understand the helicopter’s position in space. Based on the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data, the helicopter’s trajectory changed several times in that last .5 miles. It is likely that the pilot was not referencing his flight instruments or was experiencing the effects of spatial disorientation. Based on the available information, it is likely that the pilot became spatially disoriented and lost control of the helicopter after departing on a visual flight rules flight into reduced visibility, night conditions",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 30, 2021, about 2025 eastern standard time, a Robinson R44 II, N442VB, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Bronson, Florida. The pilot and three passengers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was not instrument rated and the helicopter was not certified for flight in instrument conditions. The pilot departed a private residence located in Bronson, Florida, about 2023, destined for his personal residence in Bell, Florida. According to automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, the helicopter departed about 2.5 miles south of the accident site. The helicopter flew northwest about 1.5 miles, then turned right and flew northeast for 1 mile. During the last .5 miles, the helicopter descended from 700 ft mean sea level (msl), to 350 ft msl, then climbed back up to 625 ft msl. The last data point showed the helicopter descending again at 550 ft msl.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness at the residence from which the pilot departed stated that the pilot was checking the weather and wanted to depart soon. He stated that the pilot said the fog and visibility was getting “bad” and his initial route home did not look good, and they needed to take another route home.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was out walking her dog, stated that she heard a helicopter about 2025. She looked for the helicopter but could not see it because it was too dark outside, and she did not see any lights. Seconds later, she heard the helicopter crash and a “large fireball” light up the sky.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWilliston Municipal Airport (X60), Williston, Florida, was located about 10 miles east-southeast of the accident site. At 2035, recorded weather at X60 included calm wind, visibility of 7 statute miles, mist, scattered clouds at 500 ft agl, temperature of 21°C, dew point temperature of 20°C, altimeter setting of 30.08 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO) in Tampa Bay, Florida, issued the following “Update” section of an Area Forecast Discussion (AFD) at 1908. This was the last AFD issued from this WFO before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUPDATE... &#x0D;\nAtmospheric conditions are very favorable for widespread radiational dense fog over land and advection fog over marine zones this evening, tonight and into Friday morning. An expanding area of low clouds and sea fog has already developed from Sarasota County through Tampa Bay and into portions of the Nature Coast with near zero visibility reported in Venice early this evening. Later this evening expected fog development to expand and become widespread and very dense overnight. Expect Dense Fog Advisories to be issued as fog impacts more areas into tonight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located in a wooded area and the wreckage path was about 225 ft long. The helicopter was heavily fragmented and scattered along a debris path on a heading of about 360° magnetic. The right skid was embedded in the ground at a 42° angle. An 8-foot-long section of the main rotor blade was embedded in the ground about 3 ft deep. The engine was located about 225 ft north of the main impact point. The main rotor gearbox and sections of the main rotor blades were located about 175 feet northeast of the main impact point. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor gearbox was forwarded to the manufacturer for further examination. The examination revealed that the damage to the gearbox was impact related and no preimpact anomalies were noted. Examination of the engine did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy of the pilot was performed by the Office of the Medical Examiner, District 8, Gainesville, Florida. The autopsy report was reviewed by the NTSB Investigator-In-Charge. According to the autopsy report, the cause of death was injuries sustained in a helicopter crash, and the manner of death was accident. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Passengers reported that the helicopter flight was a sightseeing flight won at a local charity auction. The flight began normally with the intention to fly over the front-seat passenger’s childhood home but diverted to the passenger’s current home due to low clouds along the original route. The rear-seat passengers stated that the helicopter flew down the road where the residence was located and then around the house making a level right turn at low speed. The helicopter then flew over a pond on the property and toward the house. As the helicopter approached the house it was facing a southerly direction and came to a hover above the trees where the accident occurred. The passengers stated that the helicopter was either motionless in the hover or slightly drifting. The helicopter then began to rotate to the right, completing 2 revolutions while descending. The helicopter rotors struck trees and then fell onto a pile of wood that had been stacked due to land clearing activities. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter did not reveal any preimpact anomalies and a passenger reported that the helicopter’s engine was still running after the accident. &#x0D;\nVideo evidence showed that just before the accident the helicopter was operating with about 89% torque and in a hover about 150 ft above the ground, and no engine anomalies were recorded. Aviation weather reports indicated that the helicopter may have been facing into a slight wind of about 3 knots (kts); however, the lack of nearby official weather reporting stations, and the variability of unofficial weather reporting stations, made the wind determination inconclusive. &#x0D;\nLoss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) can be affected by numerous factors that could not be conclusively eliminated. Based on the lack of evidence of a mechanical failure, passenger witness accounts, and video showing the helicopter’s instrument panel after the initiation of the rotation, the helicopter likely sustained an aerodynamic loss of tail rotor effectiveness that resulted in an exceedance of the yaw capability of the helicopter during a high-power hover maneuver at low altitude, from which the pilot was unable to recover.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter maintenance records were not available during the investigation; however, the maintenance facility that completed the most recent maintenance provided a copy of the inspections performed. The records provided indicated that the helicopter had received 12-month and 24-month inspections per the manufacturer’s maintenance manual on May 20, 2021. - The helicopter was not equipped with on-board flight or data recording equipment; however, the front-seat passenger recorded the flight on his personal cellular telephone. Three recordings were obtained from the family and examined by a National Transportation Safety Board recorder specialist. The recordings were short, with durations of 11, 21, and 46 seconds respectively.&#x0D;\nThe first recording began with an inward view showing the individual who was holding the phone and then panned to the rear where the two rear-seat passengers could be seen. The engine sounds indicated that the helicopter was powered on and no abnormal sounds were heard.&#x0D;\nThe second recording was an outward forward-facing view and captured the helicopter taking off and climbing. The helicopter was adjacent to the left side of a runway. About 10 seconds into the video, the helicopter turned to the left and climbed over trees before flying over a field. No abnormal engine noises were heard.&#x0D;\nThe third video also captured a predominately outward forward-facing view but panned a few times during the recording. At 2 seconds after the start of the recording, the camera was pointed out of the left side of the helicopter and showed the ground and a parking area with some utility vehicles. At 5 seconds, the camera panned forward and showed the helicopter flying at a low altitude over a tree line. At 15 seconds, the camera panned to the right and captured the instrument panel. The helicopter’s airspeed was 40-45 kts, the altitude read 400 ft, heading was 230°, and the attitude indicator showed a slight left roll. A status bar displayed “GPS” in green, and “MSG” in orange. The annunciator panel was not illuminated with any warnings or cautions. At 22 seconds, the helicopter began a right turn, and the camera captured the turbine power between 97-100% and the rotor rpm between 90-100%. The helicopter’s airspeed was just below 40 kts and the altitude was 400 ft. At 26 seconds, the helicopter continued the right turn. Torque was about 60% and airspeed had slowed to about 35 kts. At 31 seconds, the helicopter had circled the house and began to hover. A left drift occurred as the helicopter yawed to face the backside of the house. At 38 seconds, as the helicopter was behind the house, the torque indicator read about 82% and the airspeed was at 0 kts. At 39 seconds, the torque indicator read about 89% and airspeed read 0 kts. At 46 seconds, the recording ended. At no time during the recoding were any abnormal engine noises heard. The passengers reported that the third video ended seconds before the accident occurred. - On December 30, 2021, about 1141 central standard time, a Bell 206B helicopter, N8AU, was substantially damaged during an accident near Livingston, Texas. The pilot and one passenger were fatally injured, and two passengers received minor injuries. The flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. &#x0D;\nAutomatic dependent surveillance - broadcast data for the flight showed that the helicopter departed the Livingston Municipal Airport (00R) about 1107 and headed east-northeast for about 25 nautical miles (nm) before reversing course to a west-southwest direction. The helicopter then turned further south before the end of the data at 1138. The final recorded location was 1.8 nm northeast of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. ADS-B Flight Path Depiction&#x0D;\nVideo from the front left passenger’s cellular phone showed that the helicopter flew along the road where the passenger’s house was located. The video showed that the helicopter was traveling about 40 kts about 150 ft above ground level before slowing and making a right turn around the house. The helicopter completed about 270° of turn and slowed to a hover before the video ended. The audio portion of the video captured the sounds of the rotors and the engine. No discernable unusual noises were evident in the audio recording. The video and audio ended before the accident occurred.&#x0D;\nAccording to the surviving passengers, the flight was a sightseeing flight that the deceased front-seat passenger had won at a local charity auction. On the day of the accident, the passengers met the pilot at 00R. The original intent was to fly over the deceased passenger’s childhood home near Woodville, TX. While on course toward Woodville, it became evident that the flight could not be continued due to low clouds and the helicopter was then maneuvered to the passenger’s current residence near Livingston, TX. The rear-seat passengers stated that the helicopter flew down the road where the residence was located and then around the house making a level right turn at low speed. The helicopter then flew over a pond on the property and toward the house. As the helicopter approached the house it was facing a south direction and came to a hover above the trees where the accident occurred. The passengers stated that the helicopter was either motionless in the hover or slightly drifting. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Depiction of the Flight Final Path to the Accident Site &#x0D;\nOnce in the hover, the helicopter began to rotate to the right, which one passenger initially thought was the pilot intentionally maneuvering the helicopter. The helicopter continued to rotate, and the passenger realized the rotation was not intentional. The helicopter rotated about two full revolutions before striking a tree with the rotor blades and descending to the ground. It came to rest on its left side on top of a wood pile that had been created due to land clearing. One passenger noticed, after attending to the pilot and front-seat passenger, that the helicopter’s engine was still running. He started moving any switch he could find to the “off” position until the helicopter’s engine stopped. - The passenger seated in the front left seat of the helicopter was fatally injured in the accident. The pilot, seated in the front right seat, initially survived and was transported to a hospital but succumbed to his injuries 13 days after the accident. The death certificate listed complications following multiple blunt force injuries as the cause of death. - Unofficial weather stations located between 5 and 12 miles from the accident site recorded winds from 357° to 196° with magnitudes varying from 1 to 4 kts. The quality of the data from the unofficial sites could not be determined. - The pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with multi-engine land airplane and rotorcraft-helicopter certificates. He also had private pilot privileges for single-engine land airplanes. He reported civil flight experience that included 1679 total and 72 hours in last six months as of his most recent medical exam dated July 15, 2016. He was issued a Second-Class Medical Certificate without limitation on that date. The medical certificate expired for all classes in 2018, but he had applied for BasicMed. The pilot had most recently completed the BasicMed Course on June 7, 2020, and the most recent submission of the required Comprehensive Medical Examination Checklist (CMEC) was on June 13, 2018.&#x0D;\nReview of pilot flight records indicated that he had about 200.9 hours of flight experience in helicopters, which included about 71.7 hours in the accident make and model. - The Federal Aviation Administration’s Helicopter Flying Handbook describes Loss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness (LTE) as a condition that occurs “when the flow of air through a tail rotor is altered in some way, either by altering the angle or speed at which the air passes through the rotating blades of the tail rotor system.” This can result in the required thrust from the tail rotor exceeding the thrust available. The Helicopter Flying Handbook further stated regarding LTE:&#x0D;\nThis alteration of tail rotor thrust can be affected by numerous external factors. The main factors contributing to LTE are:&#x0D;\n1. Airflow and downdraft generated by the main rotor blades interfering with the airflow entering the tail rotor assembly.&#x0D;\n2. Main blade vortices developed at the main blade tips entering the tail rotor.&#x0D;\n3. Turbulence and other natural phenomena affecting the airflow surrounding the tail rotor.&#x0D;\n4. A high power setting, hence large main rotor pitch angle, induces considerable main rotor blade downwash and hence more turbulence than when the helicopter is in a low power condition.&#x0D;\n5. A slow forward airspeed, typically at speeds where translational lift and translational thrust are in the process of change and airflow around the tail rotor will vary in direction and speed.&#x0D;\n6. The airflow relative to the helicopter; &#x0D;\na. Worst case—relative wind within ±15° of the 10 o’clock position, generating vortices that can blow directly into the tail rotor. This is dictated by the characteristics of the helicopters [sic] aerodynamics of tailboom position, tailrotor size and position relative to the main rotor and vertical stabilizer, size and shape. &#x0D;\nb. Weathercock stability—tailwinds from 120° to 240°, such as left crosswinds, causing high pilot workload.&#x0D;\nc. Tail Rotor Vortex Ring State (210° to 330°). Winds within this region will result in the development of the vortex ring state of the tail rotor.&#x0D;\n7. Combinations (a, b, c) of these factors in a particular situation can easily require more anti-torque than the helicopter can generate and in a particular environment LTE can be the result. - Figure 3. Helicopter as viewed during on-scene examination (NTSB Photo)&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted terrain and rolled over onto its left side coming to rest on a pile of logs. The forward fuselage and left side fuselage and tail boom sustained substantial damage. The main and tail rotors were separated. The elevation at the accident site was about 250 ft above mean sea level.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter did not reveal any preimpact failures or malfunctions with the airframe, rotor systems, engine, or flight controls that would have precluded normal operations. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was preparing for a cross-country flight in the newly-leased, non-instrument flight rules (IFR) equipped helicopter. Per the lease agreement, he flew in the local traffic pattern to assess the helicopter without incident. The weather reportedly deteriorated during the day, changing from marginal visual flight rules (VFR) conditions to IFR conditions. Local personnel warned him of the hazards of flying through the Smoky Mountains in such conditions; however, the pilot responded, “those are hills” and he had 14 years of mountain flying experience. The pilot subsequently took off with his passenger toward mountainous terrain. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn-board video captured most of the flight and all of the accident sequence, revealing that the pilot proceeded to the east, flying along valleys and roads, as the mountains ahead were obscured in low ceilings. The flight continued as the visibility eventually deteriorated to “zero” and the helicopter entered instrument meteorological conditions. The were no attempts to reverse course to get to better weather. The pilot eventually lost control of the helicopter and crashed into a tree line in a steep descent. The helicopter was substantially damaged, the pilot was seriously injured, and his passenger was fatally injured. The pilot would later report to law enforcement personnel that he remembered losing engine oil pressure and the main rotor began to make a loud noise, so he performed an autorotation; however, with the cloud cover, he could not see.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of a malfunction or anomaly that would have precluded normal operation. There was no evidence of a loss of engine oil or oil pressure.

    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter was not certificated for flight in instrument meteorological conditions. - On December 29, 2021, at 1425 eastern standard time, a Robinson Helicopter Company R-44 II, N544SC, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Cosby, Tennessee. The commercial pilot received serious injuries and the passenger was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAccording to personnel at Gatlinburg-Pigeon Forge Airport (GKT), Sevierville, Tennessee, the pilot and passenger traveled from Utah to pick up the helicopter after leasing it from the owner. They arrived at the service center where the helicopter had been stored about 0830 on the day of the accident. The pilot reviewed the lease agreement and conducted a local flight around the GKT airport traffic pattern to assess the helicopter per the lease agreement.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAccording to personnel at the service center, “the weather throughout the day was changing from marginal VFR conditions to IFR conditions.” The pilot had conversations with the service center employees about leaving the area but was cautioned by all of them he spoke with about the dangers of flying in the Smoky Mountains in marginal weather. One person showed him a book in their training room filled with controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents that occurred in the area. The pilot’s response was “those are hills,” and informed him he had 14 years of experience of mountain flying. Additionally, a local helicopter air ambulance pilot who worked on the airport met the pilot and asked about his intentions. The pilot stated he planned on departing towards Asheville and was going to follow Interstate 40 (I-40) through the gorge to Raleigh, North Carolina, where he would visit relatives before heading back west. The other helicopter pilot told him that the mountains east of GKT were 6,000 ft and “there was no way he would make it there.” He also stated there were powerlines above the I-40 gorge.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAbout 1413, the pilot and passenger departed GKT eastbound. Federal Aviation Administration radar data showed the helicopter flying through the valleys in an easterly/southeasterly direction at altitudes between 1,200 ft and 1,750 ft. The data was not continuous along the route. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA GoPro video camera was mounted inside the cockpit and was recording during the flight. The camera and its memory card were forwarded to the National Transportation Safety Board Vehicle Recorders Laboratory for examination and analysis. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutomatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data for the flight began about ½ nm east of the departure end of runway 10, at 1413:20. The video began at 1414:54, when the helicopter was already in flight. When the video began, there was rising terrain ahead of the helicopter, portions of which contained mountain top obscuration. The cloud layer appeared broken at the helicopter’s current position, with thickening ahead of the helicopter and up along the horizon.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the helicopter approached an area of low visibility and rising terrain, the helicopter continued in a gradual ascent. At 1424:34, the visibility started to greatly decrease. The helicopter’s groundspeed (and indicated airspeed) at first showed a decreasing trend. By 1424:48, the manifold pressure was reduced and the groundspeed and indicated airspeed decreased and reached a minimum of less than 20 knots. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the indicated airspeed reached a minimum, manifold pressure increased, the helicopter pitched forward, and airspeed increased slightly. Visible landmarks under the helicopter suggested it again had a forward component of speed. As the helicopter continued to fly forward, visibility decreased even further, eventually to “zero” at 1425:07. About the time this occurred, the manifold pressure went through the red arc range to a maximum of about 27 inHg (beyond the red arc range). The helicopter then pitched forward and airspeed rapidly increased to about 85 knots. During this time, the manifold pressure indicated steadily above the red arc (above 27 inHg). The helicopter then appeared to yaw rapidly to the right, the airspeed suddenly displayed “zero” knots, and the altitude decreased. The low rotor rpm warning light and aural warning alerted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter emerged from the cloud layer, first in a right roll and right yaw condition that quickly reversed to a left roll and left yaw condition. The helicopter then descended rapidly into a tree line, impacting the tops of the trees in a left yaw and level roll condition. As the helicopter descended into the tree line, the main rotor blades struck tree branches and tree trunks. Reflections in the windshield suggested the low rotor rpm light (yellow), and the low engine oil pressure light (red) illuminated during impact. The helicopter came to rest amongst the trees at ground level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no evidence in the recording that suggested that there were preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation prior to the helicopter entering an extremely low visibility condition.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLocal law enforcement personnel interviewed the pilot after the accident. He stated that he did recall the accident. He further stated that he remembered losing oil pressure and the main rotor began to make a loud noise, so he performed an autorotation; however, with the cloud cover, he could not see. - The pilot’s total flight experience was obtained from his latest Federal Aviation Administration first-class medical certificate application, dated 12/7/2021. A pilot logbook was found in the wreckage; however, it was water-damaged and partially illegible and a total flight time could not be determined. - The helicopter came to rest on a heading of 210°, on steep, wooded terrain. There was no fire. The cabin impacted the ground and was crushed forward with the tail boom raised behind the cabin. The tail rotor was separated and resting on the right side of the wreckage. Examination of the wreckage revealed all airframe, main rotor, tail rotor, and powerplant components were accounted for at the scene. The main and auxiliary fuel tanks remained attached to the fuselage. The auxiliary fuel tank was examined and appeared to be full. Fuel was collected from both tanks with no contamination noted. Flight control continuity was confirmed from all flight control surfaces to the flight controls in the cockpit.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe engine was examined and remained attached to the airframe with minor impact damage. The engine compartment was free of oil or fuel residue; there was no evidence of a loss of engine oil in flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth main rotor blades remained attached to the main rotor hub, and one blade was bent, but complete. The other blade was bent and impact-separated into three pieces. The majority of the blade was attached to the main rotor hub, with 3 ft of the tip separated in two sections: about 2.5 ft of blade material and the weighted tip. Both sections were located near the main wreckage to the north.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter recovery of the wreckage to a salvage storage facility, the engine was examined in greater detail. The engine mount and structural tubing aft of the firewall were impact damaged. The engine-driven fuel pump overboard drain line fitting was impact-separated from the pump. The fuel strainer was impact damaged. The fuel strainer screen was absent of debris. &#x0D;\nThe fuselage was suspended from a lift. The upper spark plugs were removed and the engine crankshaft was rotated by turning the cooling fan. Continuity of the crankshaft to the rear gears and to the valvetrain was confirmed. The interiors of the cylinders were viewed using a lighted borescope and no damage to the pistons or valves was noted. &#x0D;\nThe fuel strainer was bypassed using locally-sourced hoses and fittings. An external fuel source was plumbed to the aircraft fuel system and serviced with aviation gasoline. An external battery was connected to the aircraft starter and to the airframe electric fuel pump. When the electric fuel pump was energized, fuel leaked around the fuel injector servo throttle shaft and the attempt to run the engine was abandoned. Closer examination of the throttle shaft revealed that it was bent consistent with contact with the aircraft firewall during the accident sequence. &#x0D;\nAll of the spark plugs and the rocker covers were removed. The aircraft engine oil pressure gauge was energized using an external battery and the engine crankshaft was rotated by energizing the engine starter motor. The oil pressure gage indicated about 60 PSI.   &#x0D;\nThe fuel injector servo remained attached to the engine and was impact damaged. The servo was removed and partially disassembled. The rubber diaphragms were observed intact. The servo fuel inlet screen was unobstructed. The fuel flow divider remained attached to the engine. No damage was noted and it was not removed. The two-piece fuel injector nozzles were unobstructed. The engine-driven fuel pump remained attached to the engine. No damage was noted and it was not removed.&#x0D;\nBoth magnetos remained attached to the engine and no damage was noted. Both were removed and each produced spark from all ignition towers when rotated by hand. The spark plug electrodes exhibited gray coloration and normal wear condition when compared to a Champion Check-A-Plug chart. The electrodes of the Nos. 2 top, 6 top, 2 bottom, 4 bottom and 6 bottom spark plugs were oil soaked.&#x0D;\nThe engine oil dipstick indicated about 5 quarts of oil in the engine oil sump. No oil was observed on the exterior of the engine. The oil suction screen was absent of debris. The oil filter media was absent of metallic debris.&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe and engine revealed no malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was operating the helicopter in an area of low cloud ceilings, fog, and mist. Flight data showed that the helicopter’s altitude varied and that the maximum altitude reached was 175 ft above ground level. The last recorded altitude was 75 ft. The helicopter subsequently collided with a guy wire suspended between two transmission line trusses and impacted the highway below. A postimpact fire ensued and destroyed the helicopter. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. The pilot did not receive an official weather briefing before the flight. After the accident, a US Coast Guard pilot was deployed to the accident area. The Coast Guard pilot stated that a “wall of clouds” extended from the power lines westward to the accident area. Thus, the accident pilot likely could not see the power lines due to the reduced visibilities in mist and clouds at the accident time.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On December 14, 2021, about 1236 central standard time, a Bell 407 helicopter, N150AS, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near LaPlace, Louisiana. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operating as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter departed from the Gonzales, Louisiana, area and was en route to New Orleans Lakefront Airport (NEW), New Orleans, Louisiana. Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data tracked the helicopter’s flightpath as it flew toward NEW. The helicopter’s altitude varied between 75 and 175 ft above ground level (agl). About 0.88 miles from the accident site, the helicopter descended to 50 ft agl. The last ADS-B data point, at 1236:26, indicated that the helicopter was near the intersection of transmission lines over Interstate 10. At that time, the helicopter was traveling at a groundspeed of about 104 knots and an altitude of 75 ft agl.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter subsequently collided with a western guy wire suspended between two transmission line trusses. The guy wire was estimated to be about 130 ft above a trestle bridge on the highway. Several commercial vehicle video cameras captured the helicopter’s descent and impact with the highway. A postimpact fire ensued and destroyed the helicopter. - A review of meteorological information revealed that no frontal boundaries were near the accident site. The closest official aviation weather observation station reported 4 miles visibility, mist, in addition to a broken ceiling at 400 ft, and an overcast ceiling at 1,000 ft. An upper air sounding displayed the potential for cloud formation between 600 to 3,250 ft. Weather satellite imagery of the accident site showed cloud cover above the accident site and to the north and west. At the time of the accident, the clouds were moving south to north. AIRMET Sierra, issued at 0845, forecast instrument meteorological conditions with mist and fog through 1500 near the accident site.&#x0D;\nThe pilot did not receive a weather briefing from Leidos Flight Service or ForeFlight.&#x0D;\nAfter the accident, a US Coast Guard (USCG) helicopter was launched to the scene to provide search and rescue support. The USCG pilot reported that the weather was visual flight rules (VFR) at Louis Armstrong International Airport (MSY), New Orleans, Louisiana, but deteriorated to marginal VFR and instrument flight rules to the west. Because of low-level fog, the stanchions of the power lines were “barely visible” from the east; from the west, the fog layer was above the power lines with high cloud layers that reached about 1,200 ft. The USCG pilot also reported that, from a top&#x1E;down view, “there was very dense fog from all areas with a tall column of clouds to the west of the power line intersection” where the accident occurred. The USCG pilot stated that the helicopter orbited with good visibility at 500 ft over the shoreline but that, on land to the west, a “wall of clouds” to 1,200 ft was present. - A review of the pilot’s logbook revealed that he had 12 hours of instrument flight experience, all of which were logged in fixed-wing aircraft. The pilot’s most recent instrument flight was on May 21, 2019. - The helicopter impacted the highway on a trestle bridge in a steep nose-low attitude. The main rotor blades, mast, and transmission separated from the fuselage and fell into Lake Pontchartrain. The postimpact fire consumed most of the fuselage.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the wreckage revealed markings on two main rotor blades that were consistent with contact with a braided metal wire. No anomalies were found with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "A witness reported seeing the gyroplane flying straight and level about two miles from the departure airport. The witness reported the gyroplane then tumbled tail over nose three times before he lost sight of it below the tree line. The gyroplane sustained substantial damage when it impacted the heavily vegetated terrain. &#x0D;\nThe smell of fuel was present at the accident site and there was no evidence of a wire or bird strike. Additionally, there were no reports of downed power lines or power outages in the accident area.&#x0D;\nExamination of the gyroplane revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The gyroplane was equipped with a horizontal stabilizer that remained intact. The engine was likely producing power at the time of the accident, because two of its propeller blades contacted the main rotor blades during the accident sequence. The main rotor blades sustained minimal damage, consistent with the gyroplane entering a low-rotor-rpm state for undetermined reasons before ground impact.&#x0D;\nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), FAA-H-8083-21, Chapter 21, Gyroplane Emergencies, if rotor force is rapidly removed, some gyroplanes may pitch forward abruptly into a power pushover event and if not corrected can continue to tumble and become irreversible.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\nOn December 2, 2021, about 1115 Pacific standard time, an experimental amateur-built, Sport Copter Vortex gyroplane, N425RD, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Lakeport, California. The pilot was fatally injured. The gyroplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nWitnesses located about 2 miles west of the accident site observed the gyroplane in level flight, about the same height as a set of telephone poles, and then saw it tumble tail over nose three times before they lost sight of it behind a tree line. The gyroplane was not equipped with an automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast transponder and it was flying too low for radar coverage.&#x0D;\nPILOT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe pilot had been involved in another accident in the same area while flying a gyroplane in August 2020. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined the probable cause of that accident to be: &#x0D;\n“The pilot’s distraction and failure to maintain adequate airspeed during a low altitude maneuver, which resulted in a loss of aircraft control and collision with terrain.” See NTSB accident report WPR20CA253.&#x0D;\nFlight logbook records were not recovered for the pilot; however, at the time of the last accident, he reported to the NTSB that he had accrued 853.8 total hours of flight time in single-engine airplanes and 71.3 total hours in rotorcraft.&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe entire gyroplane came to rest generally intact on its left side on flat open terrain covered with tall heavily vegetated brush near the shoreline of a lake. The fuselage sustained crush and bending damage, consistent with the impact, and there was no evidence to indicate an inflight structural failure. The smell of fuel was present at the accident site and there was no evidence of a wire or bird strike. There were no reports of damaged power lines or power outages in the accident area.&#x0D;\nThe rotor head and mast were intact and remained attached to the airframe. The main rotor blade hub could be rotated freely. The main rotor blades remained attached to the hub bar and straps and both showed a 20° downward bow outboard of the strap fittings. Both blades exhibited similar tear marks to their trailing edge skins, just outboard of the straps. One blade exhibited a black streak on its lower surface next to the strap consistent with engine propeller blade contact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was established from the foot pedals through to the rudder surface, and from the cyclic control stick through to the rotor mast.&#x0D;\nThere was no evidence of a catastrophic engine failure, and the engine crankshaft could be rotated via the propeller reduction drive hub. One propeller blade remained attached at the hub. The second propeller blade had detached at the root, and the third propeller blade had similarly detached but its tip was not located in the surrounding heavy vegetation.&#x0D;\nFurther examination of the gyroplane revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nAn autopsy of the pilot was performed by Bennet Omalu Pathology, Stockton, California. The autopsy report was reviewed by the NTSB Investigator-In-Charge. According to the autopsy report, the cause of death was blunt force trauma.&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory found no drugs of abuse.&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Rotorcraft Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21), Chapter 21, Gyroplane Emergencies, if the rotor force is rapidly removed, some gyroplanes may tend to pitch forward abruptly, often referred to as a power pushover, forward tumble, or buntover. “A power pushover can occur on some gyroplanes that have the propeller thrust line above the center of gravity and do not have an adequate horizontal stabilizer.” Removing the rotor force is often referred to as unloading the rotor and can occur if pilot-induced oscillations become excessive, in extremely turbulent conditions are encountered, or the nose of the gyroplane is pushed forward rapidly after a steep climb. If a correction is not made, the nose pitching action can become “self-sustaining and irreversible.” Additionally, the FAA handbook states that “an adequate horizontal stabilizer slows the pitching rate and allows time for recovery.”&#x0D;\nAccording to the Pilot’s Operating Handbook, Section 3.10, Emergency Procedures, Flight Control Malfunction: “an immediate reduction of power, respectively speed [sic] may be necessary to avoid pitch oscillations or other effects affecting dynamic or static stability.” -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Prior to the flight, the pilot, who is not a mechanic, installed the flight controls at the helicopter’s left seat position. The pilot and passenger, who was in the right seat and held a student pilot certificate, departed from the pilot’s property for a local area flight. The pilot was demonstrating how he performed low-level aerial application maneuvers to the passenger. During a pass to the east, the two occupants both observed a coyote in a large field. The pilot performed a right pedal turn to get a better look at the coyote. The pilot maneuvered the helicopter to an out-of-ground effect hover over the tall grass, facing to the south, about 40 ft agl, and the two occupants were looking at the coyote. The helicopter then immediately began an uncommanded left roll.&#x0D;\nThe passenger couldn’t tell what the cyclic positions were (such as if they both went to the left or if just one went to the left) during the uncommanded left roll. The passenger reported the accident sequence happened “very fast” and that the pilot was on the flight controls for the entire flight. The helicopter did not spin, there were no vibrations emitted from the helicopter, and no alarms or warning lights came on during this period. The helicopter impacted a grass field just prior to a barbed wire fence and a postimpact fire ensued. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation; however, the helicopter was destroyed by the postimpact fire. Detailed examination of the flight control system, including determining flight control continuity, could not be established due to the impact and thermal damage. Postaccident scanning and examination of the three hydraulic servo actuators did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures that would result in a cyclic hard over sequence.&#x0D;\nBased on autopsy findings, the pilot had severe stenosis of two coronary arteries. However, there was no evidence of sudden incapacitation, and the passenger reported that the pilot was acting fine the entire flight. Thus, the pilot’s cardiovascular medical condition was not a factor in this accident. The drug identified on the pilot’s toxicology results was the non-impairing pain reliever acetaminophen, thus the pilot’s medication use was not a factor in this accident. &#x0D;\nThe passenger had reported no medical conditions that would be a factor in this accident. Toxicology testing detected no psychoactive compounds from cannabis in his blood but detected tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its psychoactive metabolite 11&#x1E;hydroxy-delta-9-THC (11-OH-THC) in his urine. THC’s inactive metabolite, carboxy-delta-9- tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH), was detected in his blood and urine, but this compound can be found long after using cannabis. Thus, it is unlikely that the passenger’s use of cannabis contributed to the accident. &#x0D;\nAt the time of the loss of lateral control, the pilot and passenger were visually focused outside of the helicopter. With the unexpected and rapid onset of the uncommanded left roll as described by the passenger, there would have been minimal time for the flying pilot to assess and initiate corrective actions. &#x0D;\nBased on the available evidence, the reason for the loss of lateral control during a hover could not be determined.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Flight Controls &#x0D;\nThe task instructions to install and remove the copilot’s flight controls is in the Bell 206 series FAA-approved maintenance manual.&#x0D;\nBell released Operations Safety Notice 206-84-12 for the Bell 206 and the TH-57 series helicopters on July 17, 1984. This document discusses the dual control-quick disconnect kit and states in part:&#x0D;\nInvestigation of a recent model 206 helicopter accident, which resulted in a fatality, revealed that lateral cyclic control was lost as a result of an improperly installed copilot’s quick-disconnect cyclic stick. &#x0D;\nFlight crews are cautioned to assure quick removal flight controls are properly installed prior to operating the helicopter. &#x0D;\nThe Bell Operations Safety Notice was released shortly after an accident (NTSB accident number DEN84FA207) that occurred on July 2, 1984. The accident report, involving a Bell 206B helicopter, stated in part:&#x0D;\nWitnesses stated the helicopter entered a “hard left turn” in a near inverted position before “it went down hard and fast.” Inspection disclosed the metal connection for the left cyclic stick was broken in half. The pilot was flying from the left seat. Examination of the cyclic stick quick disconnect locking nut revealed it was held in place on the connector by one thread. Properly installed, the locking nut tightens down over six threads on the connector. When backed out to one thread, movement of the cyclic will not produce a corresponding change in the lateral control hydraulic servos. &#x0D;\nBell subsequently released Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) 206-85-27 for the Bell 206 and the TH-57 series helicopters on March 15, 1985. This document discusses design changes made to the dual control-quick disconnect kit to help ensure proper installation. &#x0D;\nCompliance with manufacturer service bulletins for aircraft operated under 14 CFR Part 91 and 14 CFR Part 137 is not mandated by the FAA. Since the airframe maintenance records for the helicopter were not available for review, it was undetermined if ASB 206-85-27 was complied with.&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, there was no clear guidance published about the topic of flight control installation and removal (such as who is allowed to perform the task, inspection requirements, weight and balance documentation requirements, and maintenance record entry requirements) for owners, operators, pilots, and maintenance personnel operating helicopters under 14 CFR Part 91 and 14 CFR Part 137. Bell was asked by the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) if they would publish guidance on this task for operations in the United States (as the type certificate for the helicopter is held in Canada and is managed by Transport Canada) and Bell declined.&#x0D;\nRotorcraft Flight Manual&#x0D;\nA review of the FAA-approved Bell 206B rotorcraft flight manual found no guidance for pilots listed if a flight control malfunction occurs. This includes a failure of components with the flight control system transmitted through feedback, binding, resistance, or sloppiness and not mistaking these conditions for a failure of hydraulic power. Bell was asked by the NTSB IIC if they would publish guidance for pilots on this emergency procedure topic and Bell declined.&#x0D;\nStartle Response&#x0D;\nThe FAA has published a Fly Safe Fact Sheet that defines what startle response is and states in part:&#x0D;\nHumans are subject to a “startle response” when they are faced with unexpected emergency situations and may delay or initiate inappropriate action in response to the emergency. Training and preparation can reduce startle response time and promote more effective and timely responses to emergencies. - The helicopter was certificated by the FAA in both the standard and restricted airworthiness categories. According to FAA records, the pilot purchased the helicopter in November 2013.&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot’s girlfriend, she flew with the pilot in the helicopter about 1.5 weeks prior to the accident. The pilot took her on an aerial application flight in the local area to spray several crop fields and nothing abnormal was noticed with the helicopter. The girlfriend reported that the pilot was the only one who would install and remove the copilot cyclic control in the helicopter. The pilot would install the copilot cyclic if he was going to fly with his son and then the pilot would later remove it. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was modified with a Simplex 4900 aerial application spray system per a FAA-approved supplemental type certificate. At the time of the accident, the helicopter did not have the spray booms installed. Per FAA records, the helicopter was equipped with a Satloc unit (unknown model) and a Shadin Fuel Flow Indicator unit (unknown model); however, the Satloc was destroyed and the Shadin Fuel Flow Indicator unit was not identified in the wreckage. The helicopter was not equipped with a crash-resistant fuel system, nor was it required to be. An emergency locator transmitter was not identified in the wreckage and the passenger reported he was unsure if one was installed in the helicopter. &#x0D;\nThe airframe and engine maintenance records for the helicopter were not available for review. - The helicopter was not equipped with a crashworthy flight data recorder or a cockpit voice recorder, nor was it required to be. - On November 28, 2021, about 1658 central standard time, a Bell 206B helicopter, N59600, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Perry, Oklahoma. The commercial pilot sustained fatal injuries and the passenger, who held a student pilot certificate, sustained serious injuries. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the passenger, who is the pilot’s son, the pilot preflighted the helicopter at 1530. The helicopter was kept on the pilot’s property in a barn. Nothing abnormal was noticed during the preflight. During the preflight, the pilot installed the flight controls for the left seat position.&#x0D;\nFor the flight, both front doors were installed and neither occupant did any filming during the flight. The pilot, in the left seat, had on a surplus US Army (Gentex) SPH-4 helicopter flight helmet, but the flight helmet did not have a tinted visor and he did not have on sunglasses. The passenger, in the right seat, had on a headset, and he did not have on sunglasses.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter departed from the pilot’s property about 1600 with about 50 gallons of fuel onboard, and when the accident occurred there was about 25 gallons of fuel onboard.&#x0D;\nAfter departing from the property, the helicopter flew to the Perry Municipal Airport (F22), Perry, Oklahoma. The pilot flew three traffic pattern flights. After the three traffic pattern circuits, the helicopter departed the airport and flew to the west of I-35. According to the passenger, everything appeared normal with the helicopter up to this point. &#x0D;\nThe pilot flew to the west of I-35 over ranch property to demonstrate how he performed his 14 CFR 137 low-level aerial application flights in the helicopter. The passenger reported that the setting sun was in both of their eyes during this timeframe.&#x0D;\nThe pilot performed several low-level east to west maneuvers and he was demonstrating the use of the Satloc aerial application navigation system to the passenger. During these maneuvers, the helicopter was about 15 ft above ground level (agl) and was traveling about 60 kts airspeed.&#x0D;\nDuring a pass to the east, the two occupants both observed a coyote in a large field. The coyote was in tall grass, just to the south of a barbed wire fence near where the helicopter came to rest. The pilot performed a right pedal turn to get a better look at the coyote.&#x0D;\nThe pilot maneuvered the helicopter to an out-of-ground effect hover over the tall grass, facing to the south, about 40 ft agl. Both the pilot and passenger were looking at the coyote when the helicopter began an uncommanded left roll.&#x0D;\nThe passenger couldn’t tell what the cyclic positions were (such as if they both went to the left or if just one went to the left) during the uncommanded left roll. The passenger reported the accident sequence happened “very fast,” the pilot was on the flight controls for the entire flight, and that the passenger was not operating the flight controls during the accident sequence. &#x0D;\nThe pilot did not announce anything during this time regarding what he thought was going on with the helicopter. The helicopter did not spin, and the passenger did not recall the main rotor blade striking the ground before the helicopter impacted the terrain. There were no vibrations emitted from the helicopter and no alarms or warning lights came on during this period. The helicopter impacted a grass field just south of a barbed wire fence.&#x0D;\nThe grass around the helicopter instantly caught on fire after the impact. The passenger was able to extract himself and the deceased pilot away from the wreckage. About 5 minutes later, the wreckage caught on fire and was destroyed. The passenger then contacted first responders from his cellular phone who then arrived shortly after. There were no known witnesses who observed the accident sequence. - Pilot&#x0D;\nAt his most recent FAA medical examination, he reported no medications or medical conditions. According to the autopsy report from the Office of the Medical Examiner, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the cause of death of the pilot was multiple blunt force injuries and the manner of death was accident. The medical examiner reported the pilot had 90% stenosis of his left anterior descending and right coronary arteries.&#x0D;\nToxicological testing performed by the FAA’s Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified the non-sedating pain reliever acetaminophen (commonly marketed as Tylenol) in the pilot’s femoral blood and urine.&#x0D;\nPassenger&#x0D;\nAt his most recent FAA medical examination, he reported no medications or medical conditions. Toxicology testing performed by the FAA Forensic Sciences laboratory detected the primary psychoactive compound of cannabis, THC, in the passenger’s urine at 1.7 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL); THC was not detected in his blood. THC’s psychoactive metabolite 11-OH-THC was detected but not quantified in his urine but was not detected in his blood. THC’s inactive metabolite THC-COOH was detected in the passenger’s hospital admission blood at 23.4 ng/mL and in his urine at 84.1 ng/mL. - The passenger reported the local weather conditions for the flight were no wind, no turbulence, and clear visibility.&#x0D;\nA review of meteorological data indicated a light southerly wind below 2,000 ft agl, no indication of turbulence or low-level wind shear, or any other outflows or wind shifts. A pilot report indicated flight visibility of 10 miles. There were no inflight weather advisories over the region during the flight. Astronomical conditions indicated the accident occurred before sunset with a low sun elevation present.&#x0D;\nA review of the meteorological data surrounding the time and location of the accident did not reveal any meteorological areas of concern.&#x0D;\nThe estimated density altitude for the accident site was 931 ft above msl. - Pilot &#x0D;\nThe pilot, who owned the accident helicopter, worked full time as a helicopter air ambulance pilot. The pilot also worked part time as a 14 CFR Part 137 aerial application pilot (as the sole pilot in the business he owned) and as a rancher.&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s helicopter air ambulance company records were available for review; however, the pilot’s personal logbook was not available for review.&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot did not hold a mechanic certificate.  &#x0D;\nPassenger/Student Pilot&#x0D;\nThe passenger was enrolled in a university aviation program and was learning to fly helicopters. - The accident site, at an elevation of 1,056 ft above msl, consisted of private property that is used as a cattle pasture. The barbed wire fence that the helicopter came to rest just prior to, was found intact with no sign of impact. The barbed wire fence was later cut by the investigative team to facilitate access to the wreckage. All major structural parts of the helicopter were accounted for at the accident site.&#x0D;\nMost of the forward and intermediate fuselage was consumed in the fire. The tailboom detached from the intermediate fuselage and was found near the main wreckage.&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub and blade assembly remained attached to the mast which fractured just below the hub. Both main rotor blades suffered various degrees of fracturing and bending. All remnants of the main rotor blades were accounted for. The transmission case was partially consumed in the post-crash fire. Due to the thermal and impact damage, main rotor drive continuity could not be established. The tail rotor drive system was continuous within the tail boom section found adjacent to the wreckage.&#x0D;\nDuring the impact sequence, the tail rotor gearbox separated from the tail boom. The complete tail rotor assembly separated from the tail rotor gearbox output shaft. The tail rotor gearbox was able to be rotated by hand in both directions with no binding or abnormal sounds coming from the tail rotor gearbox.&#x0D;\nThe components of the fuel system, including the fuel bladder, two electric boost pumps, lower and upper tank indicating units, fuel/vent lines, fuel shutoff valve, airframe fuel filter, and an electric sump drain valve were destroyed by the fire.&#x0D;\nThe components of the hydraulic system, including the hydraulic pump and regulator assembly, three servo actuators, solenoid valve, tube assemblies, hose assemblies, and hydraulic filter were destroyed by the fire. The hydraulic servo actuator support suffered significant thermal damage. However, the left/right (cyclic) and collective (center) servo actuators were located and retained for further examination.&#x0D;\nThe components of the flight controls, including collective pitch controls, cyclic controls, and tail rotor controls were destroyed by the fire. One collective stick was present in the wreckage along with one pedal assembly. However, the cyclic control were not located in the wreckage. Due to the extensive damage to the flight controls from the fire, flight control continuity could not be established.&#x0D;\nThe hopper was destroyed and there was no evidence of chemical being carried in the helicopter at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\nThe cockpit structure, dash panel, and two cockpit seats and restraints were destroyed. All the cockpit gauges were destroyed by the impact sequence and postimpact fire and no readings were obtained.&#x0D;\nFuel samples from the airframe and engine were not available.&#x0D;\nThe turboshaft engine was found securely mounted to the remnants of the airframe. The engine sections (intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust) all sustained fire damage. Damaged sustained to the cockpit and fuselage prevented engine control continuity checks to the fuel control unit and the power turbine governor. The power turbine support was removed from the exhaust collector to inspect the remainder of the turbine stages. The second, third, and fourth stage turbine wheels were undamaged with no missing blades or nozzle airfoils. The turbine to compressor coupling (N1 shaft) was intact and dark in appearance. A silver powder-like substance was observed on the first stage nozzle shield, third stage nozzle, and third stage turbine wheel. This substance is consistent with the compressor front diffuser coating and was likely liberated during the impact sequence, supporting engine operation at impact.&#x0D;\nPostaccident Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy analysis of fluid samples extracted from the servo actuators revealed that the fluid did not match either MIL-H-5606 or MIL-H-6803 hydraulic oils that were listed in the engineering drawing. The actual identity of the fluid could not be determined, but the results of the analysis indicated that it was a mixture of a petroleum based and synthetic based hydraulic fluid, combined with a third unknown component. The passenger reported he did not know if any hydraulic fluid was added before the accident flight.&#x0D;\nPostaccident scanning and examination of the three servo actuators did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures that could result in a cyclic hard over sequence. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The non-instrument-rated helicopter pilot was returning to his home airport as the height of the overcast ceiling gradually decreased along the route of flight, consistent with the forecast conditions. While flying along the river valley at an altitude of 1,800 to 1,900 ft above mean sea level (100 to 200 ft below the clouds), the helicopter flew beneath an area of light-intensity precipitation echoes as detected by weather surveillance radar. It is likely that, at this time, the pilot encountered reduced visibility in very light rain and potential clouds. About the same time, the helicopter began to climb, and its groundspeed decreased. Shortly after climbing above the altitude of the reported cloud ceiling, the helicopter entered a relatively constant-rate turn. About 9 seconds later, the track straightened for about 3 seconds, the climb rate plateaued at about 2,400 feet per minute, and the groundspeed began to increase. The helicopter continued to climb for another 10 seconds as the groundspeed increased to about 95 knots. During this time, it again turned toward the right for about 9 seconds. Just before the end of the turn, the helicopter began to descend rapidly. As it descended through the altitude of the cloud ceiling, the rate of descent reached 16,200 feet per minute. The tracking data ended about 2 seconds later in the vicinity of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airframe revealed no preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Damage and fragmentation to the main and tail rotor blades, along with score marks on a frame tube near the tail rotor drive intermediate coupling, were consistent with rotor system rotation during the impact sequence. Impact marks found on the upper drive sheave and dents found on two of the engine’s cooling fan blades were consistent with the engine’s crankshaft not rotating at the time of impact. The drive sheave mark was an imprint with an outline of teeth from starter ring gear, which was mounted on the engine crankshaft. The imprint, (rather than scoring or cut grooves) was consistent with the engine’s crankshaft was not rotating when it contacted the sheave. Similarly, the dents on the cooling fan blades, each found directly below airframe components that likely caused the dents, suggest the cooling fan was not rotating when its blades made contact during impact. Also, the fuel servo mixture arm was found bent and in the idle-cutoff (no fuel to engine) position. The mixture cable sheathing was found stretched in several locations, consistent with tension. Tension on the cable, and other impact forces, likely pulled the mixture arm toward the idle-cutoff position. Despite these findings, no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures of the engine were discovered that would have precluded normal engine operation. The flight track information, which showed a simultaneous climb and increase in groundspeed before the accident, was consistent with the engine providing power; therefore, it is likely that the crankshaft stopped during the impact sequence before the helicopter came to rest. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s continued visual flight rules flight into an area of instrument meteorological conditions due to clouds and precipitation likely resulted in his loss of outside visual references, an environment conducive to the development of spatial disorientation, and the helicopter’s flight track was consistent with the known effects of spatial disorientation. According to the pilot’s logbook, he had not received any instrument training, nor was the helicopter certified for flight in instrument conditions. These factors increased the likelihood of the pilot becoming spatially disoriented after encountering reduced visibility conditions.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Spatial Disorientation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute's publication, \"Introduction to Aviation Physiology,\" defines spatial disorientation as a loss of proper bearings or a state of mental confusion as to position, location, or movement relative to the position of the earth. Factors contributing to spatial disorientation include changes in acceleration, flight in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), frequent transfer between visual meteorological conditions (VMC) and IMC, and unperceived changes in aircraft attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3A) describes some hazards associated with flying when the ground or horizon are obscured. The handbook states, in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe vestibular sense (motion sensing by the inner ear) in particular tends to confuse the pilot. Because of inertia, the sensory areas of the inner ear cannot detect slight changes in the attitude of the airplane, nor can they accurately sense attitude changes that occur at a uniform rate over a period of time. On the other hand, false sensations are often generated; leading the pilot to believe the attitude of the airplane has changed when in fact, it has not. These false sensations result in the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, according to the Physiology of Spatial Orientation – (StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf, nih.gov) Spatial Disorientation is defined as: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the pilot fails to sense correctly the position, motion, or attitude of his aircraft or of himself within the fixed coordinate system provided by the surface of the Earth and the gravitational vertical. - The helicopter was equipped with inflatable landing gear floats and a flight control stability augmentation system. - On October 10, 2021, at 1357 eastern daylight time, a Robinson R44 II, N637HP, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident in Cornwall, New York. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to fueling records, the pilot purchased 24.6 gallons of fuel before his departure from Floyd Bennet Memorial Airport (GFL), Glenn Falls, New York. The flight departed about 1247 with a destination of MacArthur Airport (ISP), Ronkonkoma, New York, where the helicopter was based. &#x0D;\nAccording to ADS-B tracking data and National Weather Service (NWS) records, as the helicopter flew south along the Hudson River at an altitude of 1,800 to 1,900 ft above mean sea level (msl), the overcast cloud ceiling height was decreasing. As it passed by Poughkeepsie, NY (POU) at 1349, the ceiling reported there was about 2,364 ft msl. At 1353, about 7 miles further south, the helicopter passed by the Stewart International Airport (SWF) where the ceiling was reported to be about 1,991 ft msl. At 1356, the helicopter began to climb (see figure 1). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 – Helicopter’s ADS-B-derived flight track (red/green dots) and cloud heights at nearby airports (yellow text)&#x0D;\nAccording to NWS weather surveillance radar data, near the time the climb began, the helicopter encountered an area of light intensity echoes that were moving to the north-northwest (see figure 2). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 – Helicopter’s flight track (magenta) and weather radar base reflectivity at 1357&#x0D;\nAt 1356:03 while at an altitude of 1,875 ft msl, and a ground speed of 101 knots, the helicopter began to climb straight ahead. About 9 seconds later, it reached an altitude of 2,025 ft, which was above the cloud ceiling height reported at SWF (1,991 ft). About 5 seconds later it began the first of two right turns (see figure 3). The first turn lasted about 9 seconds, with an average turn rate of 7 to 11° per second. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3 – Helicopter’s flight track during climbing turn and subsequent descent (red and green dots)&#x0D;\nFrom the start of the climb until about the end of the first right turn, the rate of climb continually increased, and the airspeed continually decreased. At the end of the first turn, the rate of climb plateaued at about 2,400 feet per minute, and the airspeed had decreased to about 45 knots. Just as the rate of climb plateaued, the airspeed trend reversed and began to increase. The helicopter continued to climb for about 10 seconds, as the airspeed increased to about 95 knots. During this time the second right turn began, lasted for about 9 seconds, at an average turn rate of 9-12° per second. At 1356:34, just before the end of the second turn, the helicopter began to descend rapidly from its peak altitude of 2,650 ft. About 6 seconds later, the descent rate reached 7,200 feet per minute. As it descended through 1,900 ft (just below the cloud ceiling height reported at SWF), the descent rate reached 16,200 feet per minute. The tracking data ended about 2 seconds later, about 0.6 nautical miles north of the accident site. The entire flight was about 70 minutes long and the accident site was located about 120 nautical miles south of GFL.   &#x0D;\nA witness on a hiking trail about 0.1 mile southeast of the accident site reported hearing the helicopter’s engine “falter and die.” One to two seconds later, he heard a swishing sound, which he attributed to the helicopter “spinning” or being “out of control;” however, he could not see the helicopter due to the tree canopy. Shortly thereafter, he heard a series of loud noises that he described as “backfires, at machine gun speed” for about 2 seconds, which he surmised was “the engine catching and the rotors slapping,” and then the sounds stopped. He reported that the visibility was “clear,” and the clouds were higher than the mountain peaks; there was no fog over the river, and he could see the river clearly from his location on the hiking trail.&#x0D;\nA second witness located about 1/2-mile northwest of the accident site reported hearing a “loud noise” that he believed was the helicopter’s engine. When he turned toward the noise, he observed the helicopter in a nose-down attitude of nearly 90°, travelling at a “high speed…straight down.” The witness lost sight of the helicopter as it descended below a tree line; shortly thereafter, he “heard it crash.” The noise he associated with the helicopter’s engine was continuous until the sound of impact. - The Office of the Medical Examiner, Orange County, New York, performed an autopsy on the pilot. The autopsy report indicated the cause of death was blunt impact injuries. &#x0D;\nToxicology testing of the pilot was performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory. Tamsulosin was detected in liver and muscle. Tamsulosin (Flomax) is an alpha blocker used to treat prostate hypertrophy and is acceptable for FAA medical certification. - Weather conditions reported at the nearest reporting station (SWF) at the time of the accident included wind from 070° at 5 knots, visibility 5 miles in mist, ceiling overcast at 1,500 ft agl, (1,991 ft msl, based on the station’s elevation), temperature 16° C, dew point temperature 14° C, altimeter setting 30.20 inches of mercury.  Data from other reporting stations along the route of flight near the accident and toward the destination airport indicated that overcast ceiling heights were decreasing from north to south. Infrared satellite imagery depicted a thick layer of clouds that obscured the accident site, with cloud tops near 27,000 ft. Weather surveillance radar imagery depicted a small area of light echoes near the end of the ADS-B data, and a large area of light to moderate echoes between the accident site and the intended destination (ISP). The radar’s lowest scanning beam was centered about 5,800 ft msl over the accident site.&#x0D;\nThe Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) issued at 0723 expected marginal visual flight rules conditions to prevail at SWF, with visibility of 6 statute miles or greater and overcast cloud ceilings at 1,200 ft above ground level (agl). The next closest TAF, also issued at 0723, expected instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions to prevail at Westchester County Airport (HPN), White Plains, New York (located 25 nautical miles southeast of the accident site), with visibility 5 statute miles in light rain showers, and cloud ceiling overcast at 800 ft agl.&#x0D;\nA national weather service AIRMET Sierra, current at the time of the accident, advised of IFR conditions expected due to ceilings below 1,000 ft agl and/or and visibility below 3 miles in precipitation and mist. The AIRMET extended over the accident site and the planned destination. There were no other SIGMETs, convective SIGMETs, or CWA’s current for the area during the period surrounding the flight.&#x0D;\nA search of the FAA contract Automated Flight Service Station provider Leidos indicated that they, and no other 3rd party vendors utilizing the Lockheed Flight Service (LFS) System, had any contact with the pilot of the accident helicopter on the day of the accident. A separate search of ForeFlight records indicated that the pilot had an account with the vendor and had used the application at 1113, and that he had created a route string for a flight from ISP to GFL via the Hudson River and back to ISP at an altitude of 1,000 ft. Before the flight, the following airports were viewed in the application (which includes the latest METAR, TAFs, and NOTAMs): Brookhaven Airport (HGV), Shirly, New York, and Minute Man Air Field (6B6), Stow, Massachusetts. The pilot did not view any weather imagery inside the application. No formal route briefing was requested and there was no confirmation the pilot reviewed or searched for the current inflight weather advisories for the area. The pilot had multiple tablet devices in the cockpit, all of which were too damaged to examine after the accident. - The pilot held a private pilot certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter rating. He did not have an instrument rating. A review of his logbook revealed that he had not recorded any actual or simulated instrument flight experience, and no instrument training was noted in the remarks section of any log entries. In November 2020, one flight was remarked with “IFR Conditions, asked for special VFR.” In May of 2021, one flight was remarked with “low clouds, rain, autopilot through clouds.” - Examination of the accident scene revealed a debris path that was about 110 ft-long and oriented on a heading of about 168° magnetic. It began with damaged treetops and broken limbs, where the tail rotor assembly and fragments of the tail rotor guard were located. The tail rotor blades were largely intact with leading edge gouge damage. The main impact crater, which contained fragmented landing gear components, was about 60 ft from the damaged tree, with the main wreckage located about 60 ft beyond the impact crater. The fuselage was fragmented and compressed from the nose toward the rear seats. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity could not be confirmed due to impact damage and some system portions were not located. However, all flight control attachment fittings remained attached at their ends. Most of the flight control push-pull tubes were fractured, some in multiple locations, consistent with overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe overriding clutch operated normally and smoothly when rotated by hand. The upper drive sheave had impact marks on the front and rear faces adjacent to the clutch centering strut and fuselage frame tubes, respectively. A 3-inch imprint consistent with the starter ring gear was present in the grooves of the upper sheave. The main and auxiliary fuel tanks were impact damaged; their bladders were breached, and a trace amount of fuel remained in the bladders. Some vegetation surrounding the impact crater and the main wreckage showed evidence of fuel blight. A portion of each main rotor blade (about 4 to 6 ft) remained attached to the hub. Most of the spar of one blade also remained attached. Fragments of damaged main rotor blades were found along the debris path; the outboard 3 ft of one blade was found 273 ft northwest of the main wreckage. Some fragments were found with wood debris in the leading edge, others with chordwise streaks of brown residue on the surface consistent with tree material. Score marks oriented in the direction of rotation were found on a fuselage frame tube adjacent to the tail rotor drive shaft intermediate coupling. The filament of the low rotor speed warning lamp on the cockpit instrument panel was found intact and demonstrated hot filament stretching. &#x0D;\nThe engine crankshaft rotated smoothly when turned by hand at the cooling fan. Crankshaft and valvetrain continuity were confirmed as the crankshaft was rotated. Two of the cooling fan blades had impact marks/dents that were inline with airframe components located directly above the blades.&#x0D;\nThumb suction and compression were attained on all six cylinders. A borescope examination of all cylinders revealed no internal damage or anomalies. Both magnetos were found separated from the engine. The left magneto was fractured in half and with the lower half not recovered. The right magneto’s upper case and capacitor were impact damaged but otherwise intact. It would not produce spark on any leads when tested as found. After replacing the damaged capacitor, it operated normally. The fuel servo was separated from the engine and partially fragmented. The mixture control arm was bent inward toward the servo and was found in the idle-cutoff position. The push-pull mixture cable was not attached to the control arm and the attachment hardware was not present. The cable sheath was found stretched (in tension) in several locations. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "A low-wing airplane and a helicopter, both of which were operating as instructional flights with flight instructors onboard, were performing takeoffs and landings at the tower-controlled airport in day visual meteorological conditions. The helicopter was performing right traffic patterns to the taxiway that paralleled the runway, while the airplane was performing right traffic patterns, outside of and above the helicopter pattern, to the runway. The helicopter had been cleared for “the option” to the taxiway, while the airplane was cleared to land shortly thereafter.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter receiving landing clearance, the instructor onboard the airplane elected to conduct a simulated engine failure to a full-stop landing, reducing the engine power to idle abeam the approach end of the runway, but did not advise the tower controller of his intentions. While on final approach, the instructor took control of the airplane and entered a forward slip. The instructor and student then heard and felt a loud “bang” and the instructor declared an emergency, thinking that the airplane had impacted birds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight track information, witness statements, and damage to the airplane indicated that the airplane descended into the helicopter while both aircraft were on final approach for landing. Review of tower control communications indicated that the accident airplane had been advised and was aware of helicopters operating to the parallel taxiway. The tower controller cleared the airplane to land behind a twin-engine airplane, and advised of a helicopter low and to the airplane's right (the accident helicopter). The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the failure of the pilots onboard the airplane to see and avoid the helicopter during landing approach, resulting in a collision with the helicopter. It is possible that the airplane’s low-wing configuration and steep descent while in the forward slip may have contributed to the pilots’ failure to see the helicopter below them.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The Chandler Municipal Airport (CHD) FAA contract tower (FCT) had a Letter of Agreement (LOA), dated August 2020, with the helicopter operator that specified responsibilities, defined terms, and established the procedures for operations of helicopters within the CHD class D airspace. The provision of the letter applied only to helicopters conducting operations by persons authorized by the helicopter operator and only when CHD control tower was in operation. The LOA established a helicopter traffic pattern to taxiway C. (see Figure 2.) The helicopter traffic pattern altitude was 1,900 ft msl and the fixed wing traffic pattern altitude was 2,300 ft msl. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. View of helicopter and airplane traffic pattern - On October 1, 2021, about 0740 mountain standard time, a Piper PA-28-181 airplane, N2868H, and a Robinson Helicopter Company R22 helicopter, N412TL, were involved in a midair collision near Chandler, Arizona. The airplane sustained minor damage and the flight instructor and student pilot onboard were not injured. The flight instructor and student pilot onboard the helicopter were fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed. Both aircraft were operated as Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flights. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor and student on board the airplane requested and received clearance from the tower controller to perform takeoffs and landings from runway 4L, remaining in the airport traffic pattern. After completing three touch-and-go landings, the tower controller instructed the airplane to switch to runway 4R and issued a frequency change. The instructor and student continued to perform touch-and-go takeoffs and landings from runway 4R, and the instructor recalled the controller requesting that the airplane extend their crosswind leg for helicopter traffic during one of their patterns.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the accident approach, the airplane was cleared for landing behind a twin-engine airplane. The instructor stated that he scanned the area for traffic, and abeam the runway numbers on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern, reduced engine power to idle to simulate a loss of engine power. On final approach for landing, the instructor took control of the airplane to demonstrate a slip and they heard and felt a loud bang. The instructor declared an emergency, thinking that the airplane had hit birds. During the landing flare, the flight instructor noticed the left wing continued to descend and used aileron inputs to keep the wing up. After the airplane touched down, it veered left and exited the runway before it came to a stop between runway 04R and 04L. Once the airplane came to a stop, he and the student pilot exited the airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses reported that an airplane on final approach descended on top of a helicopter and impacted the helicopter’s main rotor blades. The helicopter descended, impacted terrain, and a post-impact fire ensued.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of air traffic control communications revealed that, about 0732, the accident airplane was advised to extend the upwind leg for helicopters operating in the parallel taxiway pattern; one of the pilots acknowledged. About 737:06, the accident helicopter was cleared to land on the taxiway. At 0737:52, the controller cleared the airplane to land behind the twin-engine airplane, and also stated that a helicopter was present at low level, ahead of the airplane to the right, proceeding southbound. The accident airplane acknowledged. At 0740:41, the instructor onboard the airplane declared an emergency following the collision. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecorded Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) showed that both aircraft appeared to be on a base to final turn, with the airplane on the approach to runway 04R and the helicopter on the approach to taxiway C (parallel to and to the right of runway 04R). The data showed that the flight paths of the aircraft intersected about 0740:15 at an altitude of about 1,400 ft mean sea level (msl), as seen in Figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. View of helicopter and airplane ADS-B flight track data - The Maricopa County Office of the Medical Examiner in Phoenix, Arizona, performed an autopsy of the helicopter flight instructor and student pilot. The flight instructor and student pilot’s cause of death was multiple blunt impact injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter flight instructor toxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory found no drugs of abuse.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter student pilot’s toxicology testing performed by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory detected amphetamine at 7 ng/ml in the student pilot’s urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAmphetamine is a Schedule II controlled substance that stimulates the central nervous system. It is available by prescription for the treatment of attention deficit disorder and narcolepsy. It carries a boxed warning about its potential for abuse and has warnings about an increased risk of sudden death and the potential for mental health and behavioral changes. In some preparations, the prescription drug is metabolized to amphetamine; commonly marketed names include Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse. After a single 30 mg oral dose, early blood levels averaged 0.111 ug/ml and average blood levels in adults using the long-acting prescription orally for a week were about 0.065 ug/ml. - At the time of the accident, the airplane flight instructor had accumulated about 425 total hours of flight experience, of which 32 hours were as a flight instructor. - Examination of the airplane accident site revealed that the airplane came to rest upright on the dirt field between runways 04R and 04L, on a heading of about 345° magnetic. The helicopter impacted terrain about .5 mile southwest of the approach end of runway 04R.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airplane did not reveal evidence of any mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Flight control continuity was established from the cockpit to all primary flight controls. The airplane’s nose landing gear and tire, as well as the left main landing gear, had separated from the airplane and were located near the helicopter wreckage. Both tires were cut consistent with contact from the helicopter’s main rotor blades. A piece of the helicopter’s canopy was found lodged in the hat channel on the underside of the airplane.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on its left side on a heading of about 053° magnetic, at an elevation of 1,236 ft msl. No visible ground scars were observed surrounding the wreckage. All major structural components of the helicopter were located within about 15 ft of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter was limited due to impact damage and post-crash fire. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot, who was also the owner of the company, and a pilot&#x1E;rated passenger were transporting a revenue-paying passenger on a chartered helicopter flight. The flight began on the morning of the accident with an approximately 200 nautical-mile flight to their destination before returning several hours later under visual flight rules. During the return trip, they stopped at an airport to refuel. About halfway through the subsequent flight, they encountered moderate to heavy rain showers. The passenger sent a text message to his spouse stating they landed in a field because “bad storms popped up” and they were waiting for it to blow over before resuming their flight. The message included a photograph that showed a grass field, gray skies, and rain on the helicopter’s window. &#x0D;\nAccording to recorded flight track data, after departing the field, the pilot made a series of meandering track changes before proceeding to a nearby small airport where they stayed for about 5 minutes. Weather data indicated that after takeoff, the helicopter remained in areas of low ceilings and rain for the remainder of the flight. By this point in the flight, the sun had set and the end of civil twilight had passed. The helicopter subsequently passed 5 miles west of a city, then passed 2 miles east of a large powerplant before entering a large national wildlife refuge, a remote area covered with dense forest. &#x0D;\nShortly thereafter, the helicopter made a series of shallow left and right track changes. During the last 25 seconds of the flight, the helicopter entered a rapidly descending right turn and descended to ground impact. The calculated rate of descend reached nearly 4,000 feet per minute during the descent. The fragmentation of the wreckage and damage to surrounding trees revealed that the helicopter was in a 90° right bank as it came through the trees and impacted terrain.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airframe, flight control system components, transmission, rotor system, and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The helicopter was certified for operation in visual meteorological conditions (both day and night) and was not certified for operation in instrument meteorological conditions. While the helicopter was equipped with modern avionics that included tools like synthetic vision, as well as an autopilot system, the pilot’s proficiency in the use of the systems could not be determined based on available information. &#x0D;\nSome or all the ethanol detected by postmortem toxicological testing in the pilot’s tissue may have been from sources other than consumption. It is unlikely that ethanol or impairment was a factor in the accident. &#x0D;\nThe weather conditions at the time of and preceding the accident consisted of low ceilings, low visibility, and rain with marginal visual meteorological conditions expected through most of the area. Once the helicopter passed the city and powerplant that contained ground reference lighting, and entered the national forest, the dark night conditions and sparse lighting along the flightpath would have made it even more difficult for the pilot to recognize and recover from a loss of control due to spatial disorientation. Based on the wreckage distribution, which was consistent with a high-energy impact, coupled with the known low visibility present at the time of the accident, it is likely that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation and lost control of the helicopter.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On September 15, 2021, at 2046 eastern daylight time, a Robinson R66 helicopter, N888DV, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident at the Oconee National Forest, near Monticello, Georgia. The commercial pilot, the pilot-rated passenger, and one other passenger sustained fatal injuries.  The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 on-demand charter flight. &#x0D;\nThe pilot, who was the owner of the company, and a pilot-rated passenger, a part time company employee, were transporting a revenue passenger to southern Georgia and north Florida for personal business. The spouse of the passenger confirmed that the passenger chartered the flight to “look at properties” in the area and was supposed to return later that evening.  &#x0D;\nThe flight originated at Fulton County Executive Airport/Charlie Brown Field (FTY) Atlanta, Georgia, about 0700 and proceeded south, making a stop in Reidsville, Georgia, before continuing to Finlayson Farm Airport (9FL8) Greenville, Florida, where they landed and stayed for several hours before departing on the return flight under visual flight rules.&#x0D;\nDuring the return trip, they landed at Thomasville Regional Airport (TVI), Thomasville, Georgia, where they refueled with 40 gallons of fuel. Automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast (ADS–B) data indicated the flight departed TVI at 1840, then proceeded on a northerly track for about 80 nautical miles near the town of Andersonville, Georgia. At 1937, the passenger’s spouse sent a text message her husband and asked him, “What’s your ETA to home?” He responded with a photograph taken with his mobile device and stated “Approx 9:30, bad storm pop up had to land in field. It’s blowing over now.” The photograph showed a grass field, gray skies and rain on the helicopter’s window (figure 1).&#x0D;\nAfter departing the field to the west, the helicopter proceeded north and followed a powerline right-of-way for about 4 nautical miles (nm) before reversing course and following the same right-of-way south for about 3 nm. The helicopter then turned left on a southeast track for about 15 nm before making a left turn to the northeast where they made an approach and landing to Perry-Houston County Airport (PXE) Perry, Georgia about 2015.&#x0D;\nFive minutes later, the helicopter continued to the north, following a six-lane divided highway (Interstate 75); it passed 5 miles west of downtown Macon, Georgia, then about 10 minutes later passed about 2 miles east of a large powerplant shortly before entering the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge, a remote area covered with dense forest. The passenger sent a second series of text messages to his spouse during this en route portion of the flight and included a screen shot of the weather radar and their location (figure 1).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 – Screen captures of mobile telephone messages from the passenger. These included a photo of the weather about 1937 and a weather radar composite image (right).&#x0D;\nAbout 2043, the helicopter made a series of left and right track changes (figure 2), then during the last 25 seconds of the flight, when the helicopter was at 1,650 ft above mean sea level , it entered a rapidly descending right turn where the vertical speed decreased steadily from level flight to a nearly 4,000 ft per minute descent; at 2046, the ADS-B signal was lost. The helicopter collided with trees and hilly terrain at an elevation of 570 ft.  A witness south of the accident site reported hearing a low-flying helicopter and stated that at the time it was “very rainy.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 - Orthographic image of helicopter flight path (white overlay), looking south.&#x0D;\nAn additional background witness, who was also the mechanic and a helicopter pilot, stated that the operator, Atlanta Helicopters Inc, used a Robinson R-44 for charter operations, and at the time of the flight, that helicopter was down for maintenance. The owner had used the “new” R-66 for the accident flight. The owner had acquired the helicopter several months before. The witness further stated that the pilot-rated passenger was a relatively “low time” helicopter pilot with several hundred hours and likely accompanying the pilot to get some extra turbine flight experience. &#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a Garmin GDU 1060L 10-inch display and a GTN 750xi with GPS Navigation and Com; the Garmin GDU 1060L was a 10.6” horizontal format display that could accommodate Primary Flight Display (PFD) information and a multifunction display (MFD) side by side within the same unit. The display was pilot-selectable for PFD or PFD/MFD presentation, and was equipped with Helicopter Synthetic Vision, which would create a graphic display of the terrain in front of the helicopter based on a geographic database. It was driven by the Garmin GTN 750xi GPS/NAV/COMM/MFD, which performed the basic functions of GPS and VOR navigation, as well as a communication radio.  The combination of the two components could display maps, weather, traffic, airport information, and synthesized terrain in various configurations.&#x0D;\nIn addition, a HeliSAS autopilot was installed. The HeliSAS autopilot system in the accident helicopter was primarily a Stability Augmentation System (SAS), which would maintain a steady helicopter attitude by applying corrective inputs to the cyclic. The autopilot would not provide any collective or pedal inputs. Additional modes of operation could provide heading hold, altitude hold, and navigation functionality. Control inputs from the autopilot system were felt as a light cyclic centering force. The autopilot sensed helicopter attitude using a combination of sensors in the flight control computer and the onboard attitude source. The computer then sent signals to the servomotors which were connected to the bottom of the cyclic in the control tunnel. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not certified for operation under instrument flight rules and was only certified for day/night visual flight rules operation.&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator’s operations specifications (D085) section a. “The certificate holder is authorized to conduct operations under 14 CFR Part 135 using the aircraft identified on this operations specification,” registration number N206TJ, which was a Robinson R-44-II.&#x0D;\nMETEROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe recorded weather conditions at Covington Municipal Airport (CVC), Atlanta, Georgia, located about 27 miles north of the accident site at an elevation of 820 ft included, wind from 090° at 5 knots, 5 statute miles visibility, moderate rain, scattered clouds at 500 ft, broken 2,300 ft, and overcast at 11,000 ft, temperature 20° C, dewpoint 20° C; and an altimeter setting of 30.02 inches of mercury. &#x0D;\nThe recorded weather conditions at Thomaston-Upson County Airport (OPN), Thomaston, GA, about 28 miles southwest of the accident site at an elevation of 798 ft included wind from 070° at 4 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, moderate drizzle, overcast 500 ft, temperature 21° C, dewpoint 21° C, and an altimeter setting of 30.00 inches of mercury.  &#x0D;\nThe recorded weather conditions at Middle Georgia Regional Airport (MCN), Macon, GA, located about 28 miles south of the accident site at an elevation of 354 ft included wind from 060° at 7 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, light rain, few clouds 4,500 ft, broken clouds 8,500 ft, overcast 9,000 ft, temperature 22° C, dewpoint 22° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.97 inches of mercury.  &#x0D;\nThe closest National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Surveillance Doppler Radar (WSR-88D) was located at Atlanta Regional Airport-Falcon Field (FFC) Atlanta, Georgia about 42 miles north-northwest of the accident site. The FFC 0.5° base reflectivity image for 2047 with the flight track overlaid is included as figure 3. The base reflectivity inset image depicted echoes of 20 to 37 dBZ along the flight track, and the accident site located about 4 miles from an isolated cell with maximum echo intensity of 53 dBZ. The echo was moving northward at a velocity of around 15 knots. No lightning was depicted with the echo or within 25 miles of the accident site between 2000 and 2100. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3 - Doppler radar base reflectivity image for 2047 with flight track overlaid (magenta).&#x0D;\nThe MCN terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) current at the time of departure was an amended forecast issued at 1550.  The forecast period from 1800 through 0100 on September 16 expected marginal visual flight rules (MVFR) conditions to prevail, with wind from 070° at 5 knots, visibility 6 miles in light rain and mist, ceiling broken at 1,500 ft above ground level (agl). Instrument meteorological conditions were forecast at MCN after 0100 on September 16th. The next scheduled TAF was issued at 1923 and was current at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\nThe MCN TAF continued to expect MVFR conditions to prevail with wind variable at 5 knots, visibility 6 miles or more in moderate rain, ceiling broken at 2,500 ft agl, and overcast at 10,000 ft.  During a temporary period between 2000 and 2200, a of visibility 4 miles in mist, scattered clouds at 900 ft agl, and ceiling broken at 2,500 ft agl.  &#x0D;\nThe United States Naval Observatory’s documented the astronomical conditions for the accident site coordinates, on the day of the accident. The sunset was at 1941 and the end of civil twilight was at 2005, 41 minutes before the accident. Moonrise was at 1633. At the time of the accident the sun was approximately -15° below the horizon at an azimuth of 282°, and the moon was 29° above the horizon at an azimuth of 168°, with the phase a waxing gibbous with 73% of the moon’s disk illuminated.&#x0D;\nNo flight plan had been filed and there was no record found indicating that the pilot received a preflight weather briefing; however, it could not be determined if the pilot obtained weather information using other sources.&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe helicopter entered the trees on a heading of about 145°. It impacted the trees at a steep downward, right bank angle based on damage to surrounding trees before impacting the terrain, which left a 2-ft deep by 6-ft-wide crater. Several trees contained vertical and horizontal branch removal and the bark was scraped from trees prior to the primary impact point. The debris field extended for approximately 150 ft along a generally southeasterly path through the densely wooded and hilly terrain. All major components of the helicopter were located within the area. Smaller debris was widely scattered along the debris field in a fan-like pattern. &#x0D;\nDuring the impact, a 24-inch tip of 1 main rotor blade separated and was found about 75 ft from the main wreckage. The main rotor blades were impact-damaged but remained attached to the hub at their respective positions. The transmission and mast separated from the fuselage. The cockpit and cabin were severely damaged by impact forces and postimpact fire. The main rotor gearbox was separated from the airframe.  The mast fairing remained attached to the main rotor mast and was heavily distorted on the leading edge. The aft bulkhead casting was fractured, and the empennage was detached from both the tail cone and the tail rotor gearbox. The main rotor gearbox was broken open and the tail rotor output gear nose bearing housing was broken loose. Amber colored oil was visible in places in the gearbox.  Rotation of the input shaft produced movement of the tail rotor output shaft and the main rotor shaft, but movement was limited due to the fractured housing, internal damage, and a bend in the main rotor driveshaft. There were broken tree branches and pine needles inside the main rotor head, and pine needles in one blade’s pitch change housing boot. There was very slight scoring on the main rotor hub just inboard of the pitch change housing.&#x0D;\nThe main rotor gearbox output flex coupling was mostly intact, but the fan shaft was separated at the yoke.  The tail rotor driveshaft hanger bearing had been exposed to fire, was detached from the tail cone, and the bearing rotated with a ratchet feel.  The tail rotor driveshaft was separated in several places. The friction linkage was detached from the tail cone, and the friction at the pivots felt normal. The aft flex coupling appeared undamaged. The tail rotor gearbox was detached from the aft tail cone casting/bulkhead. The tail rotor gearbox was intact and free to rotate at least one full turn and contained amber oil. The tail rotor output shaft and hub appeared to be undamaged. The tail rotor blades were largely intact and had some minor damage and bending.&#x0D;\nThe flight control system was severely damaged by fire and impact forces and continuity was traced through breaks and the control tubes that could be identified.  There was no evidence of pre-impact failures or malfunctions to the control system.&#x0D;\nThe engine monitoring unit (EMU) was located in the wreckage. It had been exposed to post crash fire and the internal board and components were melted or reduced to ash. No data from the EMU could be retrieved. &#x0D;\nThe engine remained within the general wreckage of the engine bay and had been exposed to a postimpact fire. The engine exhaust cowling was crushed tightly around the engine. Hand rotation of the compressor was smooth but did not result in rotation of the N1 drive train. Removal and examination of the compressor revealed signatures of engine operation during impact. The fuel spray nozzles exhibited normal carbon coating. All turbine blades were intact and exhibited no evidence of leading-edge impact or thermal distress. Examination of the combustion chamber and gas generator turbine revealed no damage or anomalies. The accessory gearbox revealed no preimpact damage or anomaly. The engine controls were damaged by impact forces but revealed no other damage or anomaly; the control arms remained attached and moved freely.&#x0D;\nThere was no evidence of engine fire, failure, or malfunction prior to impact. All evidence found was consistent with normal engine operation. Examination of the recovered airframe, flight control system components, transmission, rotor system and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Division of Forensic Sciences performed an autopsy of the pilot’s remains. According to the autopsy report, the cause of death was multiple generalized blunt impact injuries, and the manner of death was accident. &#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory performed toxicological testing of postmortem specimens from the pilot.  Ethanol was detected at 0.019 g/dL in muscle tissue but was not detected in kidney tissue. No other drugs were detected in muscle. No blood was available for testing.&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA Advisory Circular 60-4A, “Pilot's Spatial Disorientation,” Surface references and the natural horizon may at times become obscured, although visibility may be above visual flight rule minimums. Lack of natural horizon or surface reference is common on overwater flights, at night, and especially at night in extremely sparsely populated areas or in low-visibility conditions. A sloping cloud formation, an obscured horizon, a dark scene spread with ground lights and stars, and certain geometric patterns of ground lights can provide inaccurate visual information for aligning the aircraft correctly with the actual horizon. The disoriented pilot may place the aircraft in a dangerous attitude. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On September 10, 2021, about 0930 central daylight time, a Robinson Helicopter R22 Beta, N292DD, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Mentone, Texas.  The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 aerial observation flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight was operated for the purpose of gathering cattle. GPS position data revealed that the flight departed a local staging area about 0749. The pilot proceeded about 3 miles east and, beginning about 0752, completed multiple passes in an approximate 3-mile by 3-mile area.  Ground support personnel observed the helicopter six times between 0800 and 0840. About 0859, the pilot transitioned to an area about 2 miles north of the initial area and completed multiple passes. The final GPS data point was recorded at 0926:37 about 1/2-mile north of the accident site. Due to data buffering in the GPS device, the final portion of the flight was not recorded.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was discovered about 1557 and local authorities were contacted. There were no known witnesses to the accident. The helicopter wreckage was located about 50 ft from a set of power lines in an area of low brush. The powerline support poles extended to about 50 ft above ground level (agl); the transmission lines were about 45 ft agl. One power transmission line was separated and draped over the intact lines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter sustained damage to the fuselage, tail boom, and main rotor blades. The fuselage nose exhibited localized discoloration consistent with electrical arcing damage.  Repetitive linear marks consistent with powerline contact were present aft of the arcing damage. The aft portion of the tail boom, including the tail rotor assembly, was separated and located near the main wreckage. Fragments of the tail boom in the area of the separation exhibited scuffing marks consistent with contact with a main rotor blade. Both main rotor and both tail rotor blades were damaged but remained secured to their respective hubs. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident airframe and engine examinations did not identify any anomalies consistent with a preimpact failure or malfunction.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "A witness reported observing the helicopter flying southbound at an altitude of about 50 to 75 ft above ground level. The witness stated that the helicopter was “having issues” and “could not stay up in the air.” The witness further stated that the helicopter seemed as if it were “bouncing” as it flew across a field. Just after the helicopter flew over a tree line, the witness heard a “loud sound” and “watched the [rotor] just stop.” The helicopter then “fell straight down.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage revealed that the lower inboard ends of the main rotor blade grips were bent upward and that both had semicircular indentations with the same diameter as the rotor mast. This damage was consistent with the blade grips contacting the mast, commonly referred to as mast bumping, which occurs due to excessive flapping motion of rotor blades (specifically, up-and-down motion of the blade tips). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft tailboom was separated from the helicopter and found about halfway along the 400-ft-long wreckage path. An impact mark consistent with the shape of the main rotor blade was found at the forward end of the separated section, consistent with a main rotor blade severing the tailboom. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTeetering rotor systems, such as the one on the accident helicopter, are particularly susceptible to mast bumping during low-G conditions, which can result from abrupt forward (nose-down) cyclic inputs. The witness’s description of the helicopter appearing to bounce as it was flying is consistent with repeated abrupt control inputs resulting in  oscillating low-G conditions. These inputs likely led to the mast bumping and excessive blade flapping, which resulted in a main rotor blade contacting the tailboom. The reason for the pilot’s abrupt control inputs could not be determined. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing of the pilot’s specimens detected ethanol and n&#x1E;propanol, diphenhydramine), trazadone, and a metabolite of clonazepam. The ethanol was detected in the pilot’s blood at low levels (below those considered to be impairing) and was not detected in his urine. That information, along with the presence of n-propanol in the pilot’s blood, suggested that the ethanol was from sources other than ingestion and that it likely was not a factor in the accident. The diphenhydramine results were also below the therapeutic level; therefore, that medication was not likely a factor. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had been denied a Federal Aviation Administration medical certificate due to his medical history, which included bipolar disorder and depression. The detection of trazadone (which was well below therapeutic levels) and a metabolite of clonazepam indicated that he had been taking these medications to treat diagnosed conditions. However, the toxicological results suggested that the pilot’s use of these medications was likely not a factor in the accident.    &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing also detected Delta-9-tetrahydocannabinol (THC), which showed that the pilot had used cannabis. Although the effects of THC can last a few hours, THC can be detected in the body for days or weeks. Thus, the investigation could not determine if the pilot’s use of cannabis could have been impairing and influenced his behavior during the accident flight.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On August 7, 2021, about 1800 eastern daylight time, an experimental amateur-built Rotorway Exec 162F, N162KJ, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident in Argyle, New York. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nA witness located about 1/2 mile north of the accident site observed the helicopter flying southbound at an estimated altitude of 50 to 75 ft above ground level. The witness stated that he thought that the helicopter was “having issues, as the helicopter could not stay up in the air.” The witness stated that it seemed “almost like [the helicopter] was bouncing” as it flew across a field. Just after the helicopter flew over a tree line, the witness heard a “loud sound” and “watched the [rotor] just stop.” The helicopter then “fell straight down.” A postimpact fire ensued.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot did not possess a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. His logbook included two 90-day endorsements for solo flight, the latest of which expired in June 2004. His most recent valid medical certificate was issued in 2000. In 2016, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) denied his application for medical certification due to medical history, which included bipolar disorder and depression. The pilot completed the build of the helicopter in May 2003.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the accident scene revealed a debris path that was about 400 ft long and oriented on a magnetic heading of 210°. The debris path began in an open field of 4-ft-tall grass with a 4 inch-by-4 inch fractured piece of aluminum skin from the right side of the tailboom, just forward of the tail rotor arc. The right horizontal stabilizer was located 156 ft along the wreckage path, 70 ft left of the path centerline. The left horizontal stabilizer was located about 10 ft farther along the debris path and 205 ft left of the path centerline.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA 4-ft-long section of the aft end of the tailboom, including the vertical stabilizer and the tail rotor gearbox (with one tail rotor blade attached), was located 30 ft farther down the path, 10 ft left of centerline, just after the path transitioned from the grass field to the tree line and into a wooded area. An impact mark on the right side of the tailboom section, near the fractured forward end, was consistent in size and shape with the profile of the main rotor blade. The wreckage path continued for another 200 ft through the woods and down a steep hill, with numerous fragments of clear plastic canopy along and to the left and right of the path.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage, which was located at the end of the path, came to rest on its right side and top, almost completely inverted. The wreckage was largely consumed by the postimpact fire. Molten aluminum remnants were present at several locations beneath the main wreckage. No ground scars were observed leading up to the main wreckage, and the trees and foliage along the wreckage path were not damaged, except for some broken branches directly above, and immediately surrounding, the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nControl continuity was established from the anti-torque pedals to the tail rotor through breaks in the push-pull cable. Continuity from the cockpit controls to the teetering main rotor head was partially established; several components in the push-pull cable system were not found. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nBoth main rotor blades were intact and attached to the blade grips, and both blades exhibited downward bending damage in several locations. The teetering hinge attach points were fractured on both sides of the bub plate. One rotor blade had leading-edge damage and gouging about 1 to 2 ft inboard of the blade tip. Both pitch change links were fractured at their upper (blade end) rod ends, and both links remained attached to fractured segments of their lower control horns. The inboard ends of both lower blade grips were bent upward, and each had semicircular deformation consistent with the diameter of the rotor mast, as shown in figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n“A” blade grip bottom half, with semicircular deformation&#x0D;\n“B” blade grip bottom half, with semicircular deformation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 - Damage to blade grips.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory detected ethanol in the pilot’s blood; no ethanol was detected in his urine. N-propanol (a microbial product) was detected in his blood. Diphenhydramine, trazodone, and 7-aminoclonazepam (the inactive metabolite of clonazepam) were detected in his blood and urine. Delta-9-tetrahydocannabinol (THC), 11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC, and carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol were also detected in the pilot’s blood and urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA, diphenhydramine and trazodone (used to treat depression, anxiety, and insomnia) are both sedating but can be acceptable for use if taken with sufficient waiting periods before flying; trazodone is disqualifying if used to treat bipolar disorder. Clonazepam is disqualifying due to the underlying condition it treats (panic disorders). The use of marijuana is addressed by 14 Code of Federal Regulations 91.17(a)(3), which states that “no person may act or attempt to act as a crewmember of a civil aircraft…while using any drug that affects the person’s faculties in any way contrary to safety.”.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA’s Helicopter Flying Handbook describes low-G conditions and mast bumping, stating in part the following:   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHelicopters with two-bladed teetering rotors rely entirely on the tilt of the thrust vector for control. Therefore, low-G conditions can be catastrophic for two-bladed helicopters.… &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbrupt forward cyclic input or pushover in a two-bladed helicopter can be dangerous and must be avoided, particularly at higher speeds. During a pushover from moderate or high airspeed, as the helicopter noses over, it enters a low-G condition. Thrust is reduced, and the pilot has lost control of fuselage attitude but may not immediately realize it. Tail rotor thrust or other aerodynamic factors will often induce a roll. The pilot still has control of the rotor disk, and may instinctively try to correct the roll, but the fuselage does not respond due to the lack of thrust. If the fuselage is rolling right, and the pilot puts in left cyclic to correct, the combination of fuselage angle to the right and rotor disk angle to the left becomes quite large and may exceed the clearances built into the rotor hub. This results in the hub contacting the rotor mast, which is known as mast bumping…and the energy and inertia in the rotor system can sever the mast or allow rotor blades to strike the tail or other portions of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe handbook included an illustration that depicted the hub contacting the rotor mast, as a result of improper corrective action in a low-G condition (figure 2). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was conducting a personal flight during daytime visual flight rules conditions with three passengers aboard. A witness who was driving on a nearby highway observed the helicopter flying on an easterly heading about 50 to 100 ft above ground level. The witness stated that the helicopter was initially straight and level but had suddenly made a sharp left turn. The witness briefly lost sight of the helicopter due to trees; when he reestablished visual contact, he observed the helicopter descend and impact terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of any pre-existing mechanical malfunction that would have precluded normal operation. The forward left and right control tube attachment bolts at the nonrotating swashplate were not located at the accident site or within the recovered wreckage. The flight control bolts most likely separated during the accident sequence as a result of an overstress fracture. No evidence of preexisting loosening of the attachment nuts, such as substantial thread imprints in the lug bores, was observed. This damage was consistent with the blade grips contacting the mast, commonly referred to as mast bumping, which occurs due to excessive flapping motion of rotor blades (specifically, up-and-down motion of the blade tips). It is likely that, during the flight, the pilot made an abrupt flight control input that resulted in a main rotor blade contacting the tailboom and a subsequent in-flight breakup. The reason for the pilot’s abrupt control inputs could not be determined.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The FAA’s Helicopter Flying Handbook describes low-G conditions and mast bumping, stating in part the following:   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHelicopters with two-bladed teetering rotors rely entirely on the tilt of the thrust vector for control. Therefore, low-G conditions can be catastrophic for two-bladed helicopters.… &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbrupt forward cyclic input or pushover in a two-bladed helicopter can be dangerous and must be avoided, particularly at higher speeds. During a pushover from moderate or high airspeed, as the helicopter noses over, it enters a low-G condition. Thrust is reduced, and the pilot has lost control of fuselage attitude but may not immediately realize it. Tail rotor thrust or other aerodynamic factors will often induce a roll. The pilot still has control of the rotor disk, and may instinctively try to correct the roll, but the fuselage does not respond due to the lack of thrust. If the fuselage is rolling right, and the pilot puts in left cyclic to correct, the combination of fuselage angle to the right and rotor disk angle to the left becomes quite large and may exceed the clearances built into the rotor hub. This results in the hub contacting the rotor mast, which is known as mast bumping…and the energy and inertia in the rotor system can sever the mast or allow rotor blades to strike the tail or other portions of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe handbook included an illustration that depicted the hub contacting the rotor mast, as a result of improper corrective action in a low-G condition (figure 6). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 6. Result of improper corrective action in a low-G condition - Review of the helicopter’s airframe and engine logbooks revealed that, at the time of the most recent annual inspection, the helicopter had a Hobbs meter time, an airframe total time, and an engine total time of 378.2 hours. The helicopter was not equipped with any onboard devices that would have recorded airspeed, altitude, yaw, pitch, roll, or flight control positions. - On August 1, 2021, about 1251 Pacific daylight time, a Robinson Helicopter Company R66, N7000J, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Colusa, California. The pilot and three passengers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecorded automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) showed that, about 1207, the helicopter departed Willows, California, and flew toward the foothills that bordered the western edge of the valley. The ADS-B data also showed that the helicopter turned south while over Elk Creek, California, and overflew Lodoga and Stonyford, California, before turning to the east. The helicopter continued an easterly heading for about 12 minutes and then turned to a southeasterly heading. The helicopter remained on a southeasterly heading for about 2 minutes and then initiated a left turn to an easterly heading when the helicopter was about 0.7 miles west of the accident site, as shown in figure 1. The last recorded data point showed that the helicopter was about 392 ft west of the accident site. The ADS-B data contained no altitude data for the entire flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1.  ADS-B flight track for the accident flight.&#x0D;\nA witness, who was driving south on a highway about 0.5 miles east of the accident site, reported that he noticed a helicopter flying on an easterly heading about 50 to 100 ft above ground level. The witness stated that the helicopter was initially straight and level but then suddenly made a sharp left turn. The witness briefly lost sight of the helicopter due to trees; when he re-established visual contact, he observed the helicopter “sharply diving,” and the helicopter then impacted terrain. - Examination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter impacted a tomato field.  Wreckage debris was scattered among an area that measured 360 ft by 392 ft, as depicted in figure 2. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nFigure 2. Wreckage diagram of debris area.&#x0D;\nA portion of the main rotor blade was located on the western edge of the debris area.  The right door was located about 161 ft southeast of the main rotor blade portion. About 112 ft south of the right door, the outboard portion of one blade was found. A ground impression that was about 16 ft long, 8 inches wide, and in a “U” shape was located about 8 ft east of the outboard section of the main rotor blade. The main rotor gearbox and main rotor assembly were located about 5 ft east of the ground impression.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward left and right control tubes along with their respective servos and the servo mount structure were located about 3 ft west of the main wreckage. The engine was separated from the fuselage and located adjacent to the fuselage.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe revealed that the lower windshield frame on the forward lower right area of the fuselage exhibited a dent at the separation edge that was consistent with the size and shape of the leading edge of a main rotor blade. The aft section of the fuselage exhibited buckling, compression, and crushing. The cabin area was separated behind the forward seatbacks and was tethered by various wires. The tailcone was separated at the forward end. The empennage was separated from the tail cone. The driveshaft from the engine to the gearbox was separated near the engine and exhibited twisting with tortional fractures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCyclic and collective control continuity was established, but multiple separations consistent with overload were observed throughout the systems. The forward left and right control tube attachment hardware at the nonrotating swashplate was not located at the accident site or within the recovered wreckage. All three control tubes from the servo to the swashplate remained intact with some slight bends and scratches, as shown in figure 3. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Nonrotating swashplate area and both upper areas of the left and right control tubes.&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor controls were separated in multiple areas. All areas of separation were consistent with impact damage and/or overload separation. The main rotor blades exhibited varying degrees of damage and were fractured in various areas, as shown in figure 4.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. Red and blue main rotor blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was separated from the airframe. The turbine module and fuel control unit were fractured and separated from the gearbox.  N1 and N2 rotated freely by hand. The upper magnetic chip detector was free of ferrous debris. The lower magnetic chip detector was not located.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe turbine module was disassembled for examination. The gas generator turbine turned freely by hand. The power turbine remained locked in position due to impact damage. The second, third, and fourth stage turbine air foils were intact and undamaged. The engine monitoring unit was located within the wreckage, and all stored data were downloaded. The data showed that the engine was operating at the time of the accident, which can be seen in figure 5.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5. Downloaded engine data for the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo evidence of any pre-existing mechanical anomalies were noted with the engine. The main rotor mast assembly, swashplate assembly, flight control servos, flight control upper push-pull tube assemblies, and mast fairing ribs were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor mast was bent aft, and the pitch change links were fractured on slant planes consistent with ductile overstress fracture. The tube assembly attached to the mast fairing upper rib was separated at the riveted joint just above the mast fairing rib. The rivets on the forward side of the tube assembly were sheared, and the tube portion above the fractured joint was rotated aft. The left and right upper flight control push-pull tubes were bent, and fasteners attaching the left and right control tubes to the lower swashplate assembly were missing. On the control servos, pieces of the lower flight control push-pull tubes were attached at the lower end with fractures on slant planes consistent with ductile overstress fracture. Mounting frame pieces on the control servos also had fractures on slant fracture planes consistent with ductile overstress fracture. The mast fairing ribs were deformed, and contact damage was observed at the edges of through-holes for the flight control upper push-pull tubes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward left and right control attachment lugs on the swashplate were cleaned and examined. No substantial thread imprints were observed on the bores of the attachment holes on the lugs. Remnants shaved from the attachment bolt were located on the lower forward half of the lug at the left side of the hole, and the area between the bolt remnants was rubbed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lower portion of the lug with the attachment bolt remnants was examined using a scanning electron microscope. The lower portion of the bolt remnant exhibited dimple features consistent with ductile overstress fracture. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The noncertificated pilot, who was the owner of the helicopter, originated the afternoon flight from a private residence, completed a brief fuel stop at an uncontrolled airport, and then continued toward the destination. Shortly after takeoff following the fuel stop, the pilot called a friend near the destination via video chat and informed him that he would arrive in an hour. The friend reported that everything seemed normal with the pilot, and he did not mention any concerns pertaining to the weather or helicopter. &#x0D;\nAbout an hour later, 27 miles northwest of the destination, a witness saw the helicopter land in a field. The helicopter remained on the ground for a few minutes and when the witness approached the helicopter in their car, the helicopter quickly took off toward a large body of water and continued a flight path that was consistent with a direction to the planned destination. About an hour after the helicopter was last seen by this witness, family members alerted the United States Coast Guard (USCG) that the helicopter had not arrived at the destination.&#x0D;\nThe USCG conducted a search for the helicopter based upon cellphone location data and the next day small fragments of wreckage were located on the surface of the large body of water. The pilot and passenger were also recovered, and both had sustained fatal injuries. The small fragments of wreckage located were consistent with an impact at high velocity.  &#x0D;\nBased upon planned route of flight data collected from a flight planning application, cellphone location data, and the debris area, it is likely that after the brief off-airport landing, the pilot continued the flight toward the destination. A witness described conditions at the time as low clouds, misty, with restricted visibility across the water. An NTSB weather study found that near the location of where debris was found, about the presumed time of the accident, widespread light to heavy precipitation, low clouds, and reduced visibility were present. There was no record that the pilot received an online or telephone weather briefing. Had the pilot received a weather briefing, forecasts would have alerted him of possible instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and precipitation along his route. &#x0D;\nGiven that the pilot informed his friend shortly after takeoff that he would arrive in 1 hour, and made no mention of the weather, it is likely that he was not aware of the IMC and precipitation. It is likely that the pilot performed an unplanned off-airport landing due to the weather conditions ahead, and instead of terminating the flight, he chose to continue in what had become IMC. The pilot’s attempted flight under visual flight rules in those conditions would have increased his likelihood of losing control of the helicopter due to spatial disorientation with no clear separation between the water surface and low clouds and obscuration of the horizon.&#x0D;\nThe pilot was not qualified to operate the helicopter in IMC, the helicopter was not approved for flight into IMC, and in addition, he possessed limited training to operate the helicopter in general. These findings make a mechanical problem with the helicopter an unlikely factor in the accident, however, the limited amount of wreckage found precluded the investigation from examining the helicopter for any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures.  &#x0D;\nThe pilot’s flight instructor was aware of the accident cross-country flight; however, the pilot was not issued any of the required endorsements or prerequisite training to conduct the flight. The flight instructor reported that this was not the first flight the pilot conducted in which he was not properly endorsed or authorized for. The investigation was unable to determine if the pilot understood that he was not legally authorized to conduct solo cross-country flights or carry passengers. &#x0D;\nThe flight instructor had authorized the pilot to perform solo flights, despite the student not holding the required student pilot and medical certificate. This deviation from regulations by the flight instructor likely contributed to the pilot’s subsequent deviations from regulations and his decision to conduct the accident flight despite not being properly trained or endorsed for the accident flight.&#x0D;\nBased on the pilot’s toxicology results, at least some of the detected ethanol was likely from sources other than consumption. Whether ethanol effects contributed to the accident cannot be determined from available evidence.&#x0D;\nBased on available medical and operational evidence, postmortem carbon monoxide production during prolonged water immersion likely increased the carboxyhemoglobin level in the pilot’s cavity blood after his death. It is unlikely that carbon monoxide effects contributed to the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On July 19, 2021, about 1848 eastern daylight time, a Robinson Helicopter Company R44 II, N4529J, was destroyed when it impacted the Albemarle Sound near Point Harbor, North Carolina. The non-certificated pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated by the pilot as a personal flight conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.&#x0D;\nReview of surveillance video at the Mecklenburg-Brunswick Regional Airport (AVC), South Hill, Virginia, showed that the helicopter landed near the fueling station about 1710. The pilot and passenger (who was the pilot’s brother) conducted refueling activities together. A fuel receipt showed about 32 gallons of 100-low lead were added. At 1722 the pilot and passenger boarded the helicopter, a hover taxi was initiated to runway 19, and the helicopter departed southbound from runway 19 at 1726.&#x0D;\nReview of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) automatic dependent surveillance- broadcast (ADS-B) data found that data was received for the first 2 minutes of the flight. The flight track headed southbound from runway 19, and then about 1.5 miles south of AVC, the flight track turned southeast and ended at 1728:52. No further radar or track data was located for the remainder of the flight.&#x0D;\nA friend of the pilot reported that he received a FaceTime video call from the pilot shortly after the takeoff from AVC. The pilot told him he had just refueled and they would arrive at Manteo Airport [Dare County Regional Airport (MQI), Manteo, North Carolina] in 1 hour. The friend reported that everything seemed normal, and the pilot did not mention anything about weather conditions or the helicopter.  &#x0D;\nAccording to a witness located on the northwest side of the Albemarle Sound in Hertford, North Carolina, about 1830 she and her husband heard the sound of a low flying small helicopter. She observed a blue helicopter land in an open field that was about ½ mile from the shoreline. The witness reported that she and her husband got in their car to see if any assistance was needed; however, when they were about 50 ft from the helicopter it took off. &#x0D;\nShe reported that the takeoff was quick, it sounded like a normal helicopter, and it flew toward the Albemarle Sound in a southeast direction where it eventually exited out of view over the water. She added that the weather conditions over the water were low overcast clouds, it was misty, and you could not see the land across the Sound, which was something you could see on a nice day.    &#x0D;\nAccording to the United States Coast Guard incident commander, about 1940 they were notified of an overdue helicopter destined for MQI. A search was initiated over the Albemarle Sound based upon the last known position of cell phone data from pilot and passenger. The day after the accident, fragments of the helicopter were located floating on the surface of the Sound near 36.029491°, -75.991991° which was consistent with the general area of the cell phone position data. Figure 1 shows the cell phone position data from 1816 to the final reported position at 1848. In addition, the figure shows the location of the off airport landing, the general debris area, and unidentified primary radar targets recorded around the presumed accident time. It is not known which radar targets may have belonged to the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Overview of the cell phone location data, last known takeoff position, general debris area, and planned route of flight.&#x0D;\nA limited number of small fragments of the helicopter were recovered. The pieces included seat cushions and fragments of the airframe in the area of the fuel tank. The debris displayed evidence of significant tearing and crushing. The limited amount of wreckage found precluded examining the helicopter for any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures.  &#x0D;\nAn NTSB weather study found that weather radar and satellite imagery about the time of the accident over the debris area revealed areas of widespread light to heavy precipitation and areas of low clouds and visibility. According to Leidos Flight Service and ForeFlight, there was no record that the pilot requested an online weather briefing or called flight service. Thunderstorms and instrument flight rules conditions were forecasted for the accident area at the time of the accident. Figure 2 shows radar imagery about the time of the accident over the debris area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nFigure 2: Radar reflectivity at 1848 and the accident area as denoted by the purple circle.&#x0D;\nReview of FAA airman certification records found that the pilot did not hold a student pilot certificate nor any medical certificate. Records showed that the pilot applied for a third class medical on January 29, 2021; however, the issuance decision was differed by the Aviation Medical Examiner due to the number of driving under the influence (DUI) infractions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the flight instructor, the accident pilot began flight training with him in February 2021, 1 month after the accident pilot purchased the helicopter. The pilot based the helicopter at William M. Tuck Airport (W78), South Boston, Virginia. The flight instructor estimated that he provided about 20 hours of dual flight instruction to the pilot. The flight instructor reported that the pilot had received instruction from another flight instructor within his first 20 hours of training.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn early May 2021, the flight instructor signed the student off for supervised and local solo flight and the instructor estimated that he completed about 6 hours of solo flight under his supervision. The flight instructor said that during their course of training the accident pilot “implied” to him that he possessed a medical certificate; however, he never saw a copy of the medical certificate or a student pilot certificate. The pilot’s logbooks were not recovered. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn June 30, 2021, the accident pilot informed the flight instructor that he had relocated the helicopter’s base from W78 to his private residence in Glade Hill, Virginia, despite not having the proper endorsements or authorization from the flight instructor. The last dual flight training conducted was on May 28, 2021. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor provided copies of text messages between he and the accident pilot from the afternoon of the accident. The pilot informed the flight instructor that he was going to fly through W78 for a fuel stop, and then down to “OBX for a fishing trip.” The flight instructor responded in part that fuel service was not operable at W78, and the pilot responded that he might try AVC instead. The flight instructor reported that the accident pilot did not hold endorsements for any cross-country flights, and they had performed limited cross-country training. The flight instructor reported that it was his impression that the accident pilot “knew what the rules were” and further stated that “some people don’t always play by the rules.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA friend of the pilot reported that about 1 month before the accident, the accident pilot shared with him that he was now “good to go on his own” but said that he needed more hours to get his “actual license.” The pilot informed him that he could not fly passengers for hire. The friend reported that he was unsure of whether the pilot understood that he could not fly passengers under any circumstances.&#x0D;\nThe East Carolina University Brody School of Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Division of Forensic Pathology performed the pilot’s autopsy, at the request of the North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. According to the autopsy report, the cause of death was multiple traumatic injuries. No thermal injury or airway soot was described. Changes associated with prolonged water immersion were noted. The autopsy did not identify significant natural disease.&#x0D;\nThe North Carolina Office of the Chief Medical Examiner performed toxicological testing of postmortem specimens from the pilot. This testing detected ethanol at 0.08 g/dL in cavity blood. The testing did not include measurement of carboxyhemoglobin. &#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory also tested postmortem specimens from the pilot.  Ethanol was detected at 0.093 g/dL in cavity blood, 0.097 g/dL in muscle, and 0.148 g/dL in brain. N-propanol was detected in cavity blood, muscle, and brain. N-butanol was detected in brain. The carboxyhemoglobin level in cavity blood was measured to be elevated at 19%. Of note, no specimen was available for carboxyhemoglobin testing of the passenger in this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Pilot’s Operating Handbook, visual flight rules (VFR) day and night operations were approved; however, flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) was not. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to 14 CFR § 61.23 and 61.87, a student pilot certificate and at least a 3rd class medical certificate were one of multiple requirements to solo the helicopter. Carrying passengers was also prohibited. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was conducting an aerial application flight in the helicopter. Just before the accident, a witness saw the helicopter completing east and west spray passes over a cornfield. The helicopter flew two consecutive spray passes over power transmission lines that crossed the field, but, on the third spray pass, the helicopter flew underneath the powerlines while heading west. The witness then entered a nearby barn and, shortly thereafter, heard a loud “boom,” and the barn shook momentarily. The witness exited the barn and saw smoke rising from the cornfield. The witness and another person subsequently found the helicopter engulfed in flames.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the wreckage debris path through the cornfield, the helicopter was flying to the east when a main rotor blade impacted a powerline that crossed over the field. The powerline at the point of damage was about 28 ft above the ground. The corn crop under the transmission lines was 8 to 10 ft tall. The operator stated that, during aerial application flights, the helicopter was typically flown 10 ft above the crop to ensure optimal spray disbursement. If the 10.75 ft tall helicopter flew 10 ft above the 8 ft high corn crop, then the main rotor system would be at the same elevation as the transmission line. The position of the sun relative to the helicopter at the time of the accident would likely not have impaired the pilot’s ability to see the powerlines as the helicopter flew to the east.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination revealed no evidence of a pre-existing mechanical malfunction or failure that would have prevented normal operation of the helicopter. Thus, it is likely that the pilot decided to intentionally fly the helicopter under the powerlines.",

The operator stated that, during aerial application flights, the helicopter was typically flown 10 ft above the crop to ensure optimal spray disbursement. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident review of available maintenance documentation revealed no unresolved maintenance tasks or issues with the helicopter. - On July 19, 2021, about 1600 central daylight time, a Robinson R44 II helicopter, N44BJ, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Elgin, Minnesota. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 aerial application flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness saw the helicopter completing east and west spray passes over a cornfield, with each additional spray pass progressively closer to the north end of the field. The witness saw the helicopter make two consecutive spray passes over powerlines that crossed the field, but, during the third spray pass, the helicopter flew underneath the powerlines while heading west. The witness then entered a nearby pole barn and, shortly thereafter, heard a loud “boom,” and the pole barn shook momentarily. He exited the pole barn and saw smoke rising from the cornfield. The witness and another person subsequently responded to the accident site where they found the helicopter engulfed in flames. - The Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, performed an autopsy of the pilot. His cause of death was blunt force and thermal injuries. Toxicology testing by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory detected no carboxyhemoglobin, ethanol, or tested-for drugs. - At the time of the accident, the sun’s position relative to the accident site was along a west-southwest heading (249° true) and was about 48.6° above the horizon. - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revoked the pilot’s second-class medical certificate in a letter dated February 22, 2021. The pilot had been seriously injured in a forced landing accident that occurred about 11 months before this accident. The FAA sent a letter to the pilot, dated August 10, 2020, requesting a medical examination to determine if he remained qualified to hold a second-class medical certificate, but the pilot did not undergo the requested evaluation.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 17, 2021, the pilot completed an application for a new medical certificate. On his last medical certificate application, the pilot reported 4,000 hours of total flight experience, 1,100 hours of which were flown during the previous 6 months. In addition, the pilot answered “no” when asked if his medical certificate had ever been revoked. The aviation medical examiner requested that the pilot provide information about the previous helicopter accident, but the pilot had not provided the requested records before this accident occurred.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s logbook contained only a single logbook endorsement for the required training, which was required by Special Federal Aviation Regulation 73 to act as pilot&#x1E;in&#x1E;command of a Robinson R44 helicopter. The date of the endorsement was not provided. - The initial impact location was a multiphase power transmission line, as shown in figure 1. The transmission line consisted of 24 aluminum-conducting strands over 7 steel strands, and three lines were present. The western line remained intact, the center line was frayed, and the eastern line was severed. The frayed transmission line at the point of damage was about 28 ft above the ground. The corn crop under the transmission lines was 8 to 10 ft tall. Portions of the swashplate yoke, a blade droop tusk, the pilot’s headset, and plexiglass fragments were located under and immediately east of the power transmission lines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Powerlines above the cornfield with a red rectangle identifying the center powerline (main photograph) and an inset showing the frayed center powerline.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage debris path, as shown in figure 2, measured 292 ft between the power transmission lines and the main wreckage. The wreckage debris path through the cornfield was on a 090° heading. The helicopter impacted terrain in a 15° descent angle. Fractured portions of the spray booms, cabin door, and plexiglass were scattered along the wreckage debris path.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Wreckage debris path with the red circle showing the location of the wire strike.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage, as shown in figure 3, included remnants of the cabin, landing skids, cockpit, engine, main rotor transmission, main rotor head, main rotor blades, aft fuselage, sheaves, tail rotor driveshaft, tailboom, tail rotor gear box, and tail rotor blades. The product tank was relatively intact, and its support frame was located about 15 ft north of the main wreckage. Most of the cabin and cockpit were destroyed by the postimpact fire. Flight control continuity could not be established due to the extensive damage sustained during the impact and postimpact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Main wreckage at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne of the two main rotor blades remained intact but folded in half during impact. The other main rotor blade fractured about 3 ft from the blade tip and exhibited damage consistent with impact with a power transmission line, as shown in figure 4. The outboard 3 ft of the main rotor blade, as shown in figure 5, was located about 465 ft south of where the helicopter impacted the power transmission line.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. Main rotor blade fracture with damaged power transmission line.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5. Outboard 3 ft of main rotor blade (Source: Helicopter operator).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination revealed no evidence of a pre-existing mechanical malfunction or failure that would have prevented normal operation of the helicopter. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot had completed multiple aerial application flights over a cornfield on the day of the accident. During the accident flight, the helicopter contacted a fiber-optic cable that was collocated with high-voltage transmission lines. The wire strike resulted in a loss of control, and the helicopter impacted terrain, fatally injuring the pilot and substantially damaging the helicopter.&#x0D;\nA video recording of the helicopter during a previous application flight that day revealed that the helicopter was flying at low altitude and below the trees and powerlines that surrounded the field. After each pass over the field, the helicopter gained altitude to clear the surrounding trees and powerlines, turned back, and then descended again below the trees and powerlines for the next pass. Also, a witness heard a helicopter that sounded as if it was flying “real low,” but she could not see the helicopter because of trees. The witness reported that she heard a sound “like propellers hitting a tree, and then a boom like an explosion.” &#x0D;\nNo evidence indicated a preimpact mechanical malfunction or anomaly that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed that one of the main rotor blades displayed an area, on the outboard section of the blade, that contained leading-edge damage, a wire strike signature about 8 inches inboard of the blade tip and scratching oriented at an angle that was about 45°-from the tip inward and toward the trailing edge. The other main rotor blade was missing about 3 1/2 ft of the outboard portion of the blade. These observations were consistent with the helicopter being in a right turn when the main rotor blades contacted the fiber-optic cable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt is likely that the pilot lost positional awareness during the turnaround at the end of the final application pass. Also, because the helicopter was not equipped with a wire strike prevention system and the transmission lines did not have fixed aerial obstruction features such as wire markers, which would have made the transmission lines more visible, the pilot’s attention was not likely drawn to the wires before the wire strike. Additionally, even though the helicopter was equipped with a wire strike protection system, the areas of damage on the outboard portions of the main rotor blades indicated that the contact with the fiber-optic cable likely occurred outside of the effective angle of the cable cutters.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On June 25, 2021, about 1650 central daylight time, a Garlick Helicopters OH-58+, N372NS, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident in Alpine, Alabama. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 aerial application flight. &#x0D;\nBefore the accident flight, the pilot, along with a loader/fueler (ground crewmember), had been conducting chemical spraying operations from an abandoned drag strip about 3/4 mile southwest of the accident site. The ground crewmember stated the pilot had sprayed about 5 loads (500 acres) and had 5 loads remaining to spray. Each load took between 15 and 20 minutes. The ground crewmember was not aboard the helicopter during the accident flight. &#x0D;\nAbout 1650, a local resident heard a helicopter that was flying “real low,” but she could not see the helicopter because of trees. The helicopter kept getting closer, and she heard a sound “like propellers hitting a tree, and then a boom like an explosion.” When she eventually saw the helicopter, it was “turned all to pieces.” The local resident could smell fuel, and she “started to see a little bit of smoke, but there was no fire.”&#x0D;\nA video recording captured the helicopter during an application flight over an adjacent cornfield before the accident flight. Review of the video recording revealed that the helicopter was flying at a low altitude and below the trees and powerlines that surrounded the field, and the helicopter would gain altitude at the end of each pass over the field to clear the surrounding trees and powerlines. The helicopter would then turn back and descend once again below the trees and powerlines for the next pass.&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and pilot records, the pilot held a type rating in the C/S-70 (UH-60) helicopter. He had accrued flight time in multiple aircraft, including the PA-28, 7GCAA, C150, C170, C210, S2R-T34, OH-58, and UH-60.&#x0D;\nOn June 22, 2005, the helicopter was involved in an accident while maneuvering during an aerial application flight in Graham, Texas (NTSB case no. DFW05CA172). The helicopter struck wires during a pull-up maneuver. Evidence at the accident site showed that the tailboom struck the top wire of a high&#x1E;tension string and separated in flight. After the tailboom separated, the helicopter entered an uncontrolled descent to ground impact. The wires did not have fixed aerial obstruction features (for example, orange balls) installed to make the wires more conspicuous.  A review of FAA airworthiness records revealed that FAA Form 337, Major Repair and Alteration, had not been filed with the FAA when the helicopter was rebuilt after the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the helicopter was equipped with high-skid landing gear; a spray system; and a wire strike protection system, which consisted of cable cutters mounted above the windshield and below the forward fuselage. The helicopter was not equipped with a wire strike prevention system.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not required to have, and was not equipped with, a cockpit voice recorder or a flight data recorder. Other electronic devices that might have contained nonvolatile memory were recovered from the wreckage, including a Garmin GPS unit and an Ag&#x1E;Nav unit. The NTSB Vehicle Recorders Laboratory found that the GPS track log recording function was “off,” so no data could be recovered. Also, the internal memory module from the Ag-Nav unit was removed and sent to the manufacturer, which determined that the module sustained internal damage and that no data could be recovered.&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site indicated that the helicopter had struck a fiber-optic cable that was collocated with high-voltage transmission lines on the south side of the cornfield and then impacted terrain about 415 ft from the initial wire strike with the fiber-optic cable. The transmission lines were not equipped with wire markers (aircraft warning markers). Further examination of the accident site revealed a debris path that contained a piece of cable in a tree near the south side of the field and a section of bent cable core that had come to rest in the cornfield. This debris path began near the area of the wire strike and continued on a magnetic heading of about 300° to the helicopter’s impact location. &#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter revealed that it was substantially damaged and had broken into numerous pieces on impact, with the landing gear (skids), fuselage, and tailboom all receiving varying degrees of impact damage. Further examination of the helicopter also revealed that the main rotor mast, pitch change links, main rotor hub, tail rotor, and tail rotor drive shaft were substantially damaged.&#x0D;\nExamination of the flight control system revealed numerous breaks in the cyclic control system, collective control system, and anti-torque system. Flight control continuity was able to be established from the cockpit to the breaks in the flight control system, and from the breaks in the system to the main rotor and tail rotor.&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that it displayed signatures consistent with operation during the impact sequence as some of the blades in the compressor section downstream of the air inlet were broken off opposite the direction of rotation, with the remaining blades displaying bend back and leading edge gouging. Additionally, rotational scoring was present on the walls of the compressor section.&#x0D;\nExamination of the drive train revealed that the tail rotor drive shaft displayed twisting at several breaks in the drive shaft which was indicative of production of engine power. Drivetrain continuity was able to be established from the engine to the main transmission and from the main transmission to the rotor head. Drivetrain continuity was also established from the main transmission to the breaks in the tail rotor drive shaft and from the breaks in the tail rotor drive shaft to the tail rotor gearbox, and from the tail rotor gearbox to the tail rotor. Both the main rotor hub and tail rotor could be rotated by hand, and the magnetic chip detectors were free of debris. &#x0D;\nExamination of the two tail rotor blades revealed that they had remained attached, but both had been bent near the blade root, with one blade bent about 45 degrees away from the tail boom, and the other bent about 135 degrees towards the tail boom.&#x0D;\nExamination of the two main rotor blades revealed that one blade displayed an area, on the outboard section of the blade, that contained leading-edge damage, scratching oriented at an angle of about 45° from the tip inward and toward the trailing edge. That same blade had a wire strike signature about 8 inches inboard of the blade tip. The other blade was missing about 3 1/2 ft of the outboard portion of the blade. &#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Safety Briefing magazine article, “Avoiding Wire Strikes in Rotorcraft Operations,” dated October 30, 2020, the number of wire strike accidents has increased, and wire strikes remain one of the leading fatal accident causes in low-level helicopter operations. The safety briefing continued as follows: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMany pilots mistakenly believe that just watching for wires will provide sufficient reaction time. Statistics show that all pilots flying low are susceptible to a strike, regardless of experience and ability. Several capable and experienced pilots who have survived a wire strike say the same things: ’I just didn’t see it.’ ’The wires just appeared.’ ’There was no time to think or react.’&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the US Energy Information Administration, the United States has about 200,000 miles of high-voltage transmission lines and millions of miles of low-voltage distribution lines throughout the United States. Wire strike hazards exist for operations below 500 ft above ground level. Because this environment has an inherent risk of wire strikes, flight crews must be properly trained to assess the environment and verify the presence of wires without relying solely on “see and avoid.” The FAA Safety Briefing article presented the following tips for wire hazard mitigation:&#x0D;\no Avoid low-level flight whenever it is not essential to the operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\no Become familiar with all known hazards in the operations area prior to low-level flight.&#x0D;\no Brief all crew and passengers to speak up and be specific if they see power lines, towers, or other obstacles.&#x0D;\no Look for all indicators of a power line (e.g., right of way clearing or support structures).&#x0D;\no Always cross transmission lines at the point of the supporting structure.&#x0D;\no Be prepared to climb out of the wire environment if any distraction or confusion occurs (e.g., irrelevant crew conversation, radio call, etc.).&#x0D;\no Assume that wires are always present in any unfamiliar operations area until proper high reconnaissance confirms otherwise. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "According to the operator, a new water tank and snorkel were installed on the helicopter to facilitate firefighting operations. Several days of ground testing and calibration were performed before the accident flight, which was the first flight after the water tank was installed. The purpose of the local flight was to check the operation of the fire tank system. The helicopter made six uneventful passes in front of the operator’s hangar at the airport and dropped water that was picked up from a lake adjacent to the airport. During each of these passes, the snorkel was observed to be stable. However, during the seventh pass, the snorkel was swinging from the helicopter. The helicopter then began to hover, released the water from the fire tank, and transitioned to forward flight, gaining altitude and airspeed. The snorkel continued to make large and slightly erratic oscillations as the helicopter climbed. Afterward, witnesses heard a loud bang, pieces of the main rotor blade and tail section separated, and the helicopter descended vertically to the ground. A postimpact fire ensued. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGiven the sudden change in behavior of the snorkel from a consistently stable condition in normal flight to one with large and erratic oscillations, it is likely that the tank snorkel support structure was compromised and allowed the snorkel’s oscillations to increase in such a way that the pump assembly at the end of the snorkel hose contacted the main rotor blade.  The contact imparted enough energy to fracture the rotor blade at the contact point, which resulted in an imbalanced rotor system and a subsequent in-flight breakup of the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe supplemental type certificate (STC) application for the water tank and snorkel had been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about 1 year prior to the accident. A review of the STC application documentation revealed that the FAA had not classified the water tank and snorkel system as an external load. The structural analysis of the tank used the incorrect weight of the snorkel hose and pump combination and did not account for operational loads that would be imparted into the tank by the snorkel as called for in the certification basis in the project-specific certification plan (PSCP). Testing of the snorkel and pump loads did not incorporate the water tank structure to which the snorkel was attached. The system safety analysis did not address the hazard of the snorkel contacting the main rotor system. Increased consideration in any of these areas could likely have identified design insufficiencies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn addition, the production tank that was used during flight testing was examined after the accident. A manual load test was performed with the snorkel attached to the tank snorkel support structure. When the snorkel was pulled manually from the tank, the tank structure between the hose coupler and the tank face deformed between 0.03 and 0.05 inches. These manual loads represented only a small fraction of the loads that the tank snorkel support structure would experience during normal operation. Thus, the documentation that supported the FAA’s approval of the STC was insufficient because it failed to consider the failure scenario that occurred during the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "A supplemental type certification (STC) is the FAA’s approval of a major change in the type design of a product that was previously type certificated. An FAA aircraft certification office (ACO) issues the STC. Guidance for applying for and approving an STC is contained in FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 21&#x1E;40A. The FAA ACO establishes a project team that generally consists of a project manager, engineers or technical specialists, flight test engineers and pilots, manufacturing inspectors, and operations inspectors. The FAA project team coordinates with the STC applicant to develop a project-specific certification plan (PSCP). Blackhawk Mission Equipment hired a program manager and numerous FAA designated engineering representatives (DER) to design the water tank and snorkel system, conduct testing, and provide associated documentation to the FAA project team.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PSCP listed the following technical disciplines involved in the STC application: structures, electrical systems, mechanical and structures systems, flight analyst and pilot, Designated Airworthiness Representative for Manufacturing, coupon fabrication, and electrical systems and equipment. The Denver ACO assigned a project officer, electrical systems engineer, structures engineer, flight test engineer, flight test pilot, and flight standards representative. Section 4 of the PSCP, titled Project Type, stated the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThis project is a Supplemental Type Certificate for 14 CFR part 29 regulations as determined by the Administrator, for installation of the internal water tank &amp; snorkel install on the BHI H60A/L &amp; S-70A/C model helicopters. The modifications are used in rotorcraft performing “External Load Operations &amp; Do Carriage of Cargo’ per 14 CFR Part 21.25(a)(2), (b)(1)(2) and (7). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PSCP did not specify the rotorcraft-load combination that would be applicable to the STC. According to the Denver ACO, the airworthiness standards for external loads for a transport-category rotorcraft (14 CFR 29.865) were not applied because the standard was directed toward human and nonhuman external cargo and the PSCP did not have 14 CFR 29.865 included as part of the certification basis for the project.  The PSCP also did not include the airworthiness standards for rotor blade clearances from rotorcraft structure per 14 CFR 29.661.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the Blackhawk Mission Equipment STC application package included a structural analysis of the water tank installation report, hose test report, flight test report, and functional hazard assessment (FHA) and system safety assessment (SSA). The structural analysis quantitively evaluated the water tank design and structural materials for emergency landing load cases per 14 CFR 29.561(a)(c) at amendment O. Review of the analysis report identified that an inaccurate amount of 100 pounds was used for snorkel and pump weight when the snorkel and pump weight was 137.5 pounds. The 100-pound vertical load was applied to the tank snorkel support calculation and given a margin of safety of +1.25. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, the calculations considered a static vertical load applied only to the snorkel support. The structural analysis of the snorkel support did not account for the type of dynamic loading that would be seen in operation, such as air loads imparted by the snorkel, lateral loads imparted by the snorkel, water loads imparted by the tank filling operation, water loads imparted by movement of the snorkel and pump horizontally through the water, or loads imparted by the snorkel if the assembly were snagged. After the accident, the FAA stated the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSubpart C-Strength Requirements in the PSCP, for General (29.301, 29.305(a), 29.307(a)), for flight loads (29.321-29.251, &amp; 29.561(a)(c)) were part of the certification basis. This would have required determination of the lateral and dynamic forces on the snorkel to be used in the analysis.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA hose test was conducted to determine the force required for the hose to fail in tension. The hose assembly contained a pump at one end and a hose coupler at the other end. The coupler was attached to a steel fixture, and the pump assembly was fixed to the ground. A forklift was used to lift the steel fixture with the coupled end and put tension on the hose assembly until it failed. The test found that the pump separated from the hose with 2,500 pounds of force. The test did not include the water tank snorkel support where the snorkel attaches to the tank or the lighting protection cable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight test report documented the details of the ground and flight test results that were conducted to demonstrate compliance with the applicable FAA requirements. The flight tests included observation of the behavior of the tank and snorkel system at airspeeds from 0 to 193 knots indicated airspeed (1.1 times the never-exceed speed), angle of bank up to 30°, climbs, normal descents, and autorotative descents. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the snorkel had been flight tested with up to 30° of bank, the FAA-approved rotorcraft flight manual supplement contained no limitation to restrict operation with the tank and snorkel system to a maximum of 30° of bank. When asked after the accident why the flight test did not either test an angle of bank greater than 30° or establish a 30°-degree angle of bank limitation, the FAA stated the following: “Flight testing was accomplished up to 30 deg. AOB [angle of bank] in both directions….as can be found in the company flight test report BHJ-213-107, Rev A. There was not a AOB limitation created by the applicant as part of the STC.” Thus, without an angle of bank limitation specified in the rotorcraft flight manual supplement, normal operation of the tank and snorkel system beyond 30° of bank would be permitted, which would exceed the maximum angle of bank that had been demonstrated during flight testing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn FHA and SSA documented the most likely failure conditions and mitigations for the water tank and snorkel system. The functional hazard assessment identified 13 discrete failure/hazard conditions and their effect on the rotorcraft or crew. All 13 conditions were verified using a qualitative analysis method. Three conditions were classified as “no safety effect,” seven were classified as “minor failure condition,” and two were classified as “major failure condition”:  water tank attachments become unsecure in flight and snorkel pump becomes snagged on ground obstacle or object. The failure condition of the snorkel hitting or getting entangled in the aircraft (other than the tail or main rotor) was classified as a minor failure condition. Additionally, the possibility of the snorkel contacting any portion of the rotor system was not addressed in the FHA or the SSA. The FAA stated the following regarding why neither assessment addressed snorkel contact with the rotor system:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FHA/SSA did not include snorkel contact to the rotor system due to required compliance to [14 CFR] 29.251 – vibration, using flight testing.  Flight test data showed that under normal operating parameters the snorkel structure would not create excessive vibrations to lead to the failure mode of the snorkel contacting the rotor system. These results satisfied [14 CFR] 29.1309, ‘The equipment, system, and installations whose function is required by this subchapter must be designed and installed to ensure that they performed their intended functions under any foreseeable operating condition.’&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA key part of the system safety assessment is the methodology. Section 5.1 of the FHA/SSA for the water tank and snorkel described the methodology as follows:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe safety assessment process begins with the FHA and ends with the verification that the design meets the safety requirements and regulatory standards, The safety assessment process can be either qualitative, quantitative, or both.&#x0D;\no Qualitative – Those analytical processes that assess system and aircraft safety in an objective non-numerical manner. Qualitative assessment is based on engineering judgement.&#x0D;\no Quantitative – Those analytical processes that apply mathematical methods to assess the system and aircraft safety.&#x0D;\nFrom the flow chart (ref [FAA] AC 29-2C) it was determined that a qualitative analysis would be appropriate because the failure conditions identified in the FHA were not hazardous or catastrophic, the dominant failure condition was Major, with the majority of failure conditions either minor or having no safety effect. The water tank system and snorkel are not complex, and the system and installation is similar to a previous design.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FHA depth of analysis flow chart (in Advisory Circular 29 2C) states that “Catastrophic and Hazardous/Severe-major failure conditions will likely require both qualitative and quantitative analysis, depending on the system complexity.” - Blackhawk Mission Equipment’s STC for the internal water tank and snorkel installation on the UH-60A helicopter was approved on May 21, 2020, by the Federal Aviation Administration’s aircraft certification office (ACO) in Denver, Colorado. - Aviation Investigation Final Report&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLocation:&#x0D;Leesburg, Florida&#x0D;Accident Number:&#x0D;ERA21FA233&#x0D;Date &amp; Time:&#x0D;May 25, 2021 17:47 Local&#x0D;Registration:&#x0D;N9FH &#x0D;Aircraft:&#x0D;Bhi H60 Helicopters Llc Uh-60A &#x0D;Aircraft Damage:&#x0D;Destroyed &#x0D;Defining Event&#x0D;Collision with terr/obj (non-CFIT) &#x0D;Injuries:&#x0D;4 Fatal &#x0D;Flight Conducted Under:&#x0D;Part 91: General aviation - Flight test&#x0D;&#x0D;&#x0D;&#x0D;\nAnalysis&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, a new water tank and snorkel were installed on the helicopter to facilitate firefighting operations. Several days of ground testing and calibration were performed before the accident flight, which was the first flight after the water tank was installed. The purpose of the local flight was to check the operation of the fire tank system. The helicopter made six uneventful passes in front of the operator’s hangar at the airport and dropped water that was picked up from a lake adjacent to the airport. During each of these passes, the snorkel was observed to be stable. However, during the seventh pass, the snorkel was swinging from the helicopter. The helicopter then began to hover, released the water from the fire tank, and transitioned to forward flight, gaining altitude and airspeed. The snorkel continued to make large and slightly erratic oscillations as the helicopter climbed. Afterward, witnesses heard a loud bang, pieces of the main rotor blade and tail section separated, and the helicopter descended vertically to the ground. A postimpact fire ensued. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGiven the sudden change in behavior of the snorkel from a consistently stable condition in normal flight to one with large and erratic oscillations, it is likely that the tank snorkel support structure was compromised and allowed the snorkel’s oscillations to increase in such a way that the pump assembly at the end of the snorkel hose contacted the main rotor blade.  The contact imparted enough energy to fracture the rotor blade at the contact point, which resulted in an imbalanced rotor system and a subsequent in-flight breakup of the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe supplemental type certificate (STC) application for the water tank and snorkel had been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) about 1 year prior to the accident. A review of the STC application documentation revealed that the FAA had not classified the water tank and snorkel system as an external load. The structural analysis of the tank used the incorrect weight of the snorkel hose and pump combination and did not account for operational loads that would be imparted into the tank by the snorkel as called for in the certification basis in the project-specific certification plan (PSCP). Testing of the snorkel and pump loads did not incorporate the water tank structure to which the snorkel was attached. The system safety analysis did not address the hazard of the snorkel contacting the main rotor system. Increased consideration in any of these areas could likely have identified design insufficiencies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn addition, the production tank that was used during flight testing was examined after the accident. A manual load test was performed with the snorkel attached to the tank snorkel support structure. When the snorkel was pulled manually from the tank, the tank structure between the hose coupler and the tank face deformed between 0.03 and 0.05 inches. These manual loads represented only a small fraction of the loads that the tank snorkel support structure would experience during normal operation. Thus, the documentation that supported the FAA’s approval of the STC was insufficient because it failed to consider the failure scenario that occurred during the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nProbable Cause and Findings&#x0D;\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines the probable cause(s) of this accident to be:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe failure of the water tank snorkel support structure, which allowed the snorkel to contact the main rotor blades. Contributing to the accident was insufficient Federal Aviation Administration oversight of the supplemental type certificate process for the water tank and snorkel. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFindings&#x0D;Aircraft (A1)                      Equip attach fittings (on fus) - Failure&#x0D;\nOrganizational issues (A1)                      Oversight of reg compliance - FAA/Regulator&#x0D;\n&#x0D;&#x0D;\nFactual Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHistory of Flight&#x0D;Maneuvering-low-alt flying        Collision with terr/obj (non-CFIT)  (Defining event)&#x0D;\nManeuvering-low-alt flying        Part(s) separation from AC&#x0D;\nManeuvering        Miscellaneous/other&#x0D;\n&#x0D; &#x0D;\nOn May 25, 2021, about 1747 eastern daylight time, a BHI H60 Helicopters LLC, UH-60A, N9FH, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Leesburg International Airport (LEE), Leesburg, Florida. The pilot, copilot, and two crewmembers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 post-maintenance test flight. &#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, 8 days before the accident, a new water tank and snorkel were installed on the helicopter, in accordance with supplemental type certificate (STC) SR00933DE, to facilitate firefighting operations. Several days of ground testing and calibration were performed before the accident flight, which was the first flight after the water tank and snorkel were installed. The purpose of the local flight was to check the operation of the fire tank system, which included the new water tank and snorkel. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter made six uneventful passes in front of the operator’s hangar at LEE and dropped water that was picked up from a lake adjacent to the airport. On the seventh pass, an employee of the operator noticed that the snorkel was swinging. He called the LEE air traffic control tower and told the controller to ask the pilot to slow down and land immediately. Before the controller could contact the pilot, the helicopter transitioned to forward flight, gaining altitude and airspeed. The employee noticed that the snorkel was “violently” swinging, and he heard a loud bang. The employee saw pieces of the helicopter, including the tail section, separate from the helicopter. Afterward, the helicopter started to spin and descended below the tree line. The employee then heard an explosion and saw smoke rise above the tree line. &#x0D;\nAccording to another employee of the operator, she did not observe the helicopter’s first pass but watched the next six passes. She noted that the water being dropped from the tank was “very dirty.” During the helicopter’s last pass, this employee noticed that the snorkel was swinging in a large circle and that the snorkel end came very close to the main rotor blades. She immediately started waving her arms at the pilot to try and get his attention, but the pilot did not see her. Shortly after the helicopter climbed transitioned to forward flight and gained airspeed, this employee heard a loud bang and saw multiple main rotor blades separate and hit the tail section of the helicopter. She then saw the tail section fall to the ground and the helicopter enter a flat spin.&#x0D;\nNumerous other witnesses from the operator were present at the airport during the helicopter’s flight, including some who were recording the helicopter’s practice water drops.  Twenty-two video clips were provided to the National Transportation Safety Board for review; 19 clips showed the helicopter performing water drops before the accident water drop pass, and 3 clips showed the accident water drop pass. In all the video clips before the accident pass, the helicopter was seen flying straight and level at a constant airspeed and releasing water over a specific point in the airport infield. As the helicopter approached the water release area, the snorkel hose was stable off the left side of the helicopter. As water was released from the water tank, the water was seen impinging on the snorkel hose, and the hose remained stable. In all the video clips showing the accident water drop pass, the snorkel hose made large and slightly erratic oscillations as the helicopter approached the water drop area. The helicopter began to hover and released the water from the tank, and the water impinged on the hose. None of the 22 video clips showed the helicopter’s transition to forward flight or climbout immediately before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA security video camera mounted to a hangar that faces runway 3 captured the helicopter accident after it dropped off the water supply and proceeded down the runway heading. The video showed the helicopter flying away from the camera in level flight. The helicopter yawed suddenly, started to rotate around its vertical axis, and broke apart. The helicopter then descended vertically into the wooded area beside the runway. The behavior of the snorkel could not be observed in the video.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot Information &#x0D;Certificate: &#x0D;Commercial  Occupant #1; Commercial  Occupant #2&#x0D;Age:&#x0D;35, Male Occupant #1; 35, Male Occupant #2&#x0D;Airplane Rating(s):&#x0D;Single-engine land  Occupant #1; Single-engine land  Occupant #2&#x0D;Seat Occupied:&#x0D;Left Occupant #1; Right Occupant #2&#x0D;Other Aircraft Rating(s): &#x0D;Helicopter  Occupant #1; Helicopter  Occupant #2&#x0D;Restraint Used: &#x0D;4-point  Occupant #1; 4-point  Occupant #2&#x0D;Instrument Rating(s):&#x0D;Helicopter  Occupant #1; Helicopter  Occupant #2&#x0D;Second Pilot Present:&#x0D;Yes&#x0D;Instructor Rating(s): &#x0D;Helicopter  Occupant #1; None  Occupant #2&#x0D;Toxicology Performed: &#x0D;Yes Occupant #1, Yes Occupant #2&#x0D;Medical Certification:&#x0D;Class 1 Without waivers/limitations  Occupant #1; Class 1 Without waivers/limitations  Occupant #2&#x0D;Last FAA Medical Exam:&#x0D;January 21, 2021 Occupant #1; January 21, 2021 Occupant #2&#x0D;Occupational Pilot:&#x0D;Yes Occupant #1; Yes Occupant #2&#x0D;Last Flight Review or Equivalent:&#x0D;December 9, 2020 Occupant #1&#x0D;Flight Time:&#x0D;4873 hours (Total, all aircraft), 1344 hours (Total, this make and model) Occupant #1; 2135 hours (Total, all aircraft), 2135 hours (Total, this make and model) Occupant #2&#x0D;&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAircraft and Owner/Operator Information &#x0D;Aircraft Make:&#x0D;BHI H60 HELICOPTERS LLC &#x0D;Registration:&#x0D;N9FH &#x0D;Model/Series:&#x0D;UH-60A &#x0D;Aircraft Category:&#x0D;Helicopter &#x0D;Year of Manufacture:&#x0D;1981 &#x0D;Amateur Built:&#x0D;[SAFTIAmateurBuilt]&#x0D;Airworthiness Certificate:&#x0D;Restricted (Special)&#x0D;Serial Number:&#x0D;80-23461 &#x0D;Landing Gear Type: &#x0D;Tailwheel;  &#x0D;Seats: &#x0D;4 &#x0D;Date/Type of Last Inspection:&#x0D;December 21, 2020 Continuous airworthiness &#x0D;Certified Max Gross Wt.:&#x0D;2100 lbs &#x0D;Time Since Last Inspection:&#x0D;[SAFTITimeSinceLastInspectionHrs]&#x0D;Engines:&#x0D;2 Turbo shaft Engine #1: ; 2 Turbo shaft Engine #2: &#x0D;Airframe Total Time:&#x0D;6603 Hrs as of last inspection &#x0D;Engine Manufacturer:&#x0D;GE Engine #1: ; GE Engine #2: &#x0D;ELT:&#x0D;Installed &#x0D;Engine Model/Series:&#x0D;T700-GE-701D Engine #1: ; T700-GE-701D Engine #2: &#x0D;Registered Owner:&#x0D;BRAINERD HELICOPTERS INC&#x0D;Rated Power:&#x0D;[SAFTIEngineRatedPower]&#x0D;Operator:&#x0D;BRAINERD HELICOPTERS INC&#x0D;Operating Certificate(s) Held:&#x0D;Rotorcraft external load (133), On-demand air taxi (135)&#x0D;Operator Does Business As:&#x0D;Fire hawk&#x0D;Operator Designator Code:&#x0D;[SAFTIOperatorDesignatorCode]&#x0D;&#x0D;\nBlackhawk Mission Equipment’s STC for the internal water tank and snorkel installation on the UH-60A helicopter was approved on May 21, 2020, by the Federal Aviation Administration’s aircraft certification office (ACO) in Denver, Colorado.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMeteorological Information and Flight Plan&#x0D;Conditions at Accident Site:&#x0D;Visual (VMC)&#x0D;Condition of Light:&#x0D;Day&#x0D;Observation Facility, Elevation:&#x0D;LEE, 75 ft msl&#x0D;Distance from Accident Site:&#x0D;1 Nautical Miles&#x0D;Observation Time:&#x0D;17:53:00 Local&#x0D;Direction from Accident Site:&#x0D;157°&#x0D;Lowest Cloud Condition:&#x0D;Clear&#x0D;Visibility&#x0D;10 miles&#x0D;Lowest Ceiling:&#x0D;None&#x0D;Visibility (RVR):&#x0D;[SAFTIVisualRangeFT]&#x0D;Wind Speed/Gusts: &#x0D;8 knots / &#x0D;Turbulence Type Forecast/Actual:&#x0D;None / None&#x0D;Wind Direction:&#x0D;170°&#x0D;Turbulence Severity Forecast/Actual:&#x0D; N/A / N/A&#x0D;Altimeter Setting:&#x0D;30.15 inches Hg&#x0D;Temperature/Dew Point:&#x0D;32°C / 16°C&#x0D;Precipitation and Obscuration:&#x0D;No Obscuration; No Precipitation&#x0D;Departure Point: &#x0D;Leesburg, FL&#x0D;Type of Flight Plan Filed:&#x0D;Company VFR&#x0D;Destination: &#x0D;Leesburg, FL&#x0D;Type of Clearance:&#x0D;VFR &#x0D;Departure Time:&#x0D;[SAFTIDepartureTime]&#x0D;Type of Airspace: &#x0D;Class D &#x0D;&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirport Information&#x0D;Airport:&#x0D;LEESBURG INTL LEE&#x0D;Runway Surface Type:&#x0D;Asphalt&#x0D;Airport Elevation:&#x0D;75 ft msl&#x0D;Runway Surface Condition:&#x0D;Dry&#x0D;Runway Used:&#x0D;13&#x0D;IFR Approach:&#x0D;None&#x0D;Runway Length/Width:&#x0D;6300 ft / 100 ft &#x0D;VFR Approach/Landing:&#x0D;Traffic pattern&#x0D;&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWreckage and Impact Information &#x0D;Crew Injuries:&#x0D;2 Fatal &#x0D;Aircraft Damage:&#x0D;Destroyed &#x0D;Passenger Injuries:&#x0D;2 Fatal &#x0D;Aircraft Fire:&#x0D;On-ground &#x0D;Ground Injuries:&#x0D;N/A&#x0D;Aircraft Explosion:&#x0D;On-ground &#x0D;Total Injuries:&#x0D;4 Fatal&#x0D;Latitude, Longitude:&#x0D;28.817965°, -81.80863° estimated&#x0D;&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was located in a localized swamp approximately 1,000 ft southeast from the approach end of runway 3. The wreckage was contained in a 31-ft diameter impact crater and had been consumed by fire. Section of all four rotor blades were contained with the main wreckage. The tail rotor remained attached to the vertical stabilizer and was located about 150 ft north-northeast of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\nParts of the newly installed water tank and snorkel assembly were found on the west edge of runway 3. The water pump housing, which was installed near the snorkel inlet, was heavily fragmented. The stainless-steel snorkel suction cage was located about 50 ft west of runway 3 along with a section of main rotor blade. Several pieces of fairings and light material were lodged in the top of trees along the flightpath from the edge of the tree line to the main wreckage. &#x0D;\nThe landing gear, main rotor system, main rotor drive system, engines, hydraulic system, and forward portion of the tail rotor drive system were thermally damaged by the postcrash fire. Most of the cockpit, cabin, and flight controls were consumed by the postcrash fire.&#x0D;\nPortions of the water tank and snorkel hose connecting port were located next to the left main landing gear within the main wreckage. A 10-ft section of the hose assembly (not including the suction pump) was located underneath the forward left side of the fuselage. The upper hose remained attached to the tank snorkel support, and the coupler levers were in the locked position. Portions of the hose had torn away from the tank snorkel support, and the edges were melted. The suction pump and cage were not present on the end of the hose, and the recuperator and fragmented sections of the crown housing remained attached.  Most of the molded front section of the tank was fragmented and was largely destroyed by fire. The snorkel port that extends out of the molded front section of the tank was recovered. Examination of the snorkel port where the metal snorkel attachment fixture (coupler) fastened to the tank snorkel port showed that the gasket between the carbon-fiber flange plate and the tank port structure had torn and separated on the aft side. All the flange fasteners were in place. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditional Information&#x0D;\nA supplemental type certification (STC) is the FAA’s approval of a major change in the type design of a product that was previously type certificated. An FAA aircraft certification office (ACO) issues the STC. Guidance for applying for and approving an STC is contained in FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 21&#x1E;40A. The FAA ACO establishes a project team that generally consists of a project manager, engineers or technical specialists, flight test engineers and pilots, manufacturing inspectors, and operations inspectors. The FAA project team coordinates with the STC applicant to develop a project-specific certification plan (PSCP). Blackhawk Mission Equipment hired a program manager and numerous FAA designated engineering representatives (DER) to design the water tank and snorkel system, conduct testing, and provide associated documentation to the FAA project team.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PSCP listed the following technical disciplines involved in the STC application: structures, electrical systems, mechanical and structures systems, flight analyst and pilot, Designated Airworthiness Representative for Manufacturing, coupon fabrication, and electrical systems and equipment. The Denver ACO assigned a project officer, electrical systems engineer, structures engineer, flight test engineer, flight test pilot, and flight standards representative. Section 4 of the PSCP, titled Project Type, stated the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThis project is a Supplemental Type Certificate for 14 CFR part 29 regulations as determined by the Administrator, for installation of the internal water tank &amp; snorkel install on the BHI H60A/L &amp; S-70A/C model helicopters. The modifications are used in rotorcraft performing “External Load Operations &amp; Do Carriage of Cargo’ per 14 CFR Part 21.25(a)(2), (b)(1)(2) and (7). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PSCP did not specify the rotorcraft-load combination that would be applicable to the STC. According to the Denver ACO, the airworthiness standards for external loads for a transport-category rotorcraft (14 CFR 29.865) were not applied because the standard was directed toward human and nonhuman external cargo and the PSCP did not have 14 CFR 29.865 included as part of the certification basis for the project.  The PSCP also did not include the airworthiness standards for rotor blade clearances from rotorcraft structure per 14 CFR 29.661.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the Blackhawk Mission Equipment STC application package included a structural analysis of the water tank installation report, hose test report, flight test report, and functional hazard assessment (FHA) and system safety assessment (SSA). The structural analysis quantitively evaluated the water tank design and structural materials for emergency landing load cases per 14 CFR 29.561(a)(c) at amendment O. Review of the analysis report identified that an inaccurate amount of 100 pounds was used for snorkel and pump weight when the snorkel and pump weight was 137.5 pounds. The 100-pound vertical load was applied to the tank snorkel support calculation and given a margin of safety of +1.25. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, the calculations considered a static vertical load applied only to the snorkel support. The structural analysis of the snorkel support did not account for the type of dynamic loading that would be seen in operation, such as air loads imparted by the snorkel, lateral loads imparted by the snorkel, water loads imparted by the tank filling operation, water loads imparted by movement of the snorkel and pump horizontally through the water, or loads imparted by the snorkel if the assembly were snagged. After the accident, the FAA stated the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSubpart C-Strength Requirements in the PSCP, for General (29.301, 29.305(a), 29.307(a)), for flight loads (29.321-29.251, &amp; 29.561(a)(c)) were part of the certification basis. This would have required determination of the lateral and dynamic forces on the snorkel to be used in the analysis.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA hose test was conducted to determine the force required for the hose to fail in tension. The hose assembly contained a pump at one end and a hose coupler at the other end. The coupler was attached to a steel fixture, and the pump assembly was fixed to the ground. A forklift was used to lift the steel fixture with the coupled end and put tension on the hose assembly until it failed. The test found that the pump separated from the hose with 2,500 pounds of force. The test did not include the water tank snorkel support where the snorkel attaches to the tank or the lighting protection cable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight test report documented the details of the ground and flight test results that were conducted to demonstrate compliance with the applicable FAA requirements. The flight tests included observation of the behavior of the tank and snorkel system at airspeeds from 0 to 193 knots indicated airspeed (1.1 times the never-exceed speed), angle of bank up to 30°, climbs, normal descents, and autorotative descents. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the snorkel had been flight tested with up to 30° of bank, the FAA-approved rotorcraft flight manual supplement contained no limitation to restrict operation with the tank and snorkel system to a maximum of 30° of bank. When asked after the accident why the flight test did not either test an angle of bank greater than 30° or establish a 30°-degree angle of bank limitation, the FAA stated the following: “Flight testing was accomplished up to 30 deg. AOB [angle of bank] in both directions….as can be found in the company flight test report BHJ-213-107, Rev A. There was not a AOB limitation created by the applicant as part of the STC.” Thus, without an angle of bank limitation specified in the rotorcraft flight manual supplement, normal operation of the tank and snorkel system beyond 30° of bank would be permitted, which would exceed the maximum angle of bank that had been demonstrated during flight testing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn FHA and SSA documented the most likely failure conditions and mitigations for the water tank and snorkel system. The functional hazard assessment identified 13 discrete failure/hazard conditions and their effect on the rotorcraft or crew. All 13 conditions were verified using a qualitative analysis method. Three conditions were classified as “no safety effect,” seven were classified as “minor failure condition,” and two were classified as “major failure condition”:  water tank attachments become unsecure in flight and snorkel pump becomes snagged on ground obstacle or object. The failure condition of the snorkel hitting or getting entangled in the aircraft (other than the tail or main rotor) was classified as a minor failure condition. Additionally, the possibility of the snorkel contacting any portion of the rotor system was not addressed in the FHA or the SSA. The FAA stated the following regarding why neither assessment addressed snorkel contact with the rotor system:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FHA/SSA did not include snorkel contact to the rotor system due to required compliance to [14 CFR] 29.251 – vibration, using flight testing.  Flight test data showed that under normal operating parameters the snorkel structure would not create excessive vibrations to lead to the failure mode of the snorkel contacting the rotor system. These results satisfied [14 CFR] 29.1309, ‘The equipment, system, and installations whose function is required by this subchapter must be designed and installed to ensure that they performed their intended functions under any foreseeable operating condition.’&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA key part of the system safety assessment is the methodology. Section 5.1 of the FHA/SSA for the water tank and snorkel described the methodology as follows:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe safety assessment process begins with the FHA and ends with the verification that the design meets the safety requirements and regulatory standards, The safety assessment process can be either qualitative, quantitative, or both.&#x0D;\nQualitative – Those analytical processes that assess system and aircraft safety in an objective non-numerical manner. Qualitative assessment is based on engineering judgement.&#x0D;\nQuantitative – Those analytical processes that apply mathematical methods to assess the system and aircraft safety.&#x0D;\nFrom the flow chart (ref [FAA] AC 29-2C) it was determined that a qualitative analysis would be appropriate because the failure conditions identified in the FHA were not hazardous or catastrophic, the dominant failure condition was Major, with the majority of failure conditions either minor or having no safety effect. The water tank system and snorkel are not complex, and the system and installation is similar to a previous design.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FHA depth of analysis flow chart (in Advisory Circular 29 2C) states that “Catastrophic and Hazardous/Severe-major failure conditions will likely require both qualitative and quantitative analysis, depending on the system complexity.” &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInjuries to Persons&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDamage to Aircraft&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOther Damage&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCommunications&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight recorders&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMedical and Pathological Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFire&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSurvival Aspects&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTests and Research&#x0D;\nThe tank that underwent flight testing as part of the STC application process was production tank No. 1. The tank that was installed in the accident helicopter was production tank No. 2. An examination of production tank No.1 and a UH-60A helicopter (N135BH) was performed to document the snorkel attachment assembly in the remaining production water tank. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe water tank, snorkel, and water release gate were combined into a single system that could be placed in the cabin area of a UH-60 helicopter. The system was secured by a square tube-steel external frame that attached to the helicopter's existing upper cargo tie-down points and existing floor tie-down points. The molded front section that contained the snorkel attachment port, motorized water gate assembly (manufactured by Trotter Controls), and vent was designed and manufactured by Leading Edge Composites, which also assembled the tank side panels, integrated the molded front section to the tank, and installed the water gate assembly and associated controls. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 15-ft-long and 6-inch-diameter snorkel hose was attached to the water tank using a metal port that was attached to the tank via a carbon-fiber flange that contained a flapper valve fastened by eight AN4 bolts to a nut plate. The snorkel connected to the tank port using two lever camlocks (coupler). The water pump was attached to the free end of the snorkel. A power cable for the pump and a lightning protection cable extended down the length of the snorkel and were secured to the hose using nylon zip ties. The snorkel hose was not secured by any means other than the tank attachment point. The snorkel hose was not retractable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTo determine the tank structure deformation at the snorkel-to-tank interface, the tank port was fastened with 12 AN4 bolts and was torqued. The snorkel was attached to the tank using the coupler camlocks, as designed. A dial gauge was positioned at various points around the tank port. The snorkel was then placed on a wheeled dolly, and manual loads were applied in three separate directions (forward, lateral, and aft).

The pilot, copilot, and two crewmembers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 post-maintenance test flight. &#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, 8 days before the accident, a new water tank and snorkel were installed on the helicopter, in accordance with supplemental type certificate (STC) SR00933DE, to facilitate firefighting operations. Several days of ground testing and calibration were performed before the accident flight, which was the first flight after the water tank and snorkel were installed. The purpose of the local flight was to check the operation of the fire tank system, which included the new water tank and snorkel. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter made six uneventful passes in front of the operator’s hangar at LEE and dropped water that was picked up from a lake adjacent to the airport. On the seventh pass, an employee of the operator noticed that the snorkel was swinging. He called the LEE air traffic control tower and told the controller to ask the pilot to slow down and land immediately. Before the controller could contact the pilot, the helicopter transitioned to forward flight, gaining altitude and airspeed. The employee noticed that the snorkel was “violently” swinging, and he heard a loud bang. The employee saw pieces of the helicopter, including the tail section, separate from the helicopter. Afterward, the helicopter started to spin and descended below the tree line. The employee then heard an explosion and saw smoke rise above the tree line. &#x0D;\nAccording to another employee of the operator, she did not observe the helicopter’s first pass but watched the next six passes. She noted that the water being dropped from the tank was “very dirty.” During the helicopter’s last pass, this employee noticed that the snorkel was swinging in a large circle and that the snorkel end came very close to the main rotor blades. She immediately started waving her arms at the pilot to try and get his attention, but the pilot did not see her. Shortly after the helicopter climbed transitioned to forward flight and gained airspeed, this employee heard a loud bang and saw multiple main rotor blades separate and hit the tail section of the helicopter. She then saw the tail section fall to the ground and the helicopter enter a flat spin.&#x0D;\nNumerous other witnesses from the operator were present at the airport during the helicopter’s flight, including some who were recording the helicopter’s practice water drops.  Twenty-two video clips were provided to the National Transportation Safety Board for review; 19 clips showed the helicopter performing water drops before the accident water drop pass, and 3 clips showed the accident water drop pass. In all the video clips before the accident pass, the helicopter was seen flying straight and level at a constant airspeed and releasing water over a specific point in the airport infield. As the helicopter approached the water release area, the snorkel hose was stable off the left side of the helicopter. As water was released from the water tank, the water was seen impinging on the snorkel hose, and the hose remained stable. In all the video clips showing the accident water drop pass, the snorkel hose made large and slightly erratic oscillations as the helicopter approached the water drop area. The helicopter began to hover and released the water from the tank, and the water impinged on the hose. None of the 22 video clips showed the helicopter’s transition to forward flight or climbout immediately before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA security video camera mounted to a hangar that faces runway 3 captured the helicopter accident after it dropped off the water supply and proceeded down the runway heading. The video showed the helicopter flying away from the camera in level flight. The helicopter yawed suddenly, started to rotate around its vertical axis, and broke apart. The helicopter then descended vertically into the wooded area beside the runway. The behavior of the snorkel could not be observed in the video. - The tank that underwent flight testing as part of the STC application process was production tank No. 1. The tank that was installed in the accident helicopter was production tank No. 2. An examination of production tank No.1 and a UH-60A helicopter (N135BH) was performed to document the snorkel attachment assembly in the remaining production water tank. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe water tank, snorkel, and water release gate were combined into a single system that could be placed in the cabin area of a UH-60 helicopter. The system was secured by a square tube-steel external frame that attached to the helicopter's existing upper cargo tie-down points and existing floor tie-down points. The molded front section that contained the snorkel attachment port, motorized water gate assembly (manufactured by Trotter Controls), and vent was designed and manufactured by Leading Edge Composites, which also assembled the tank side panels, integrated the molded front section to the tank, and installed the water gate assembly and associated controls. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 15-ft-long and 6-inch-diameter snorkel hose was attached to the water tank using a metal port that was attached to the tank via a carbon-fiber flange that contained a flapper valve fastened by eight AN4 bolts to a nut plate. The snorkel connected to the tank port using two lever camlocks (coupler). The water pump was attached to the free end of the snorkel. A power cable for the pump and a lightning protection cable extended down the length of the snorkel and were secured to the hose using nylon zip ties. The snorkel hose was not secured by any means other than the tank attachment point. The snorkel hose was not retractable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTo determine the tank structure deformation at the snorkel-to-tank interface, the tank port was fastened with 12 AN4 bolts and was torqued. The snorkel was attached to the tank using the coupler camlocks, as designed. A dial gauge was positioned at various points around the tank port. The snorkel was then placed on a wheeled dolly, and manual loads were applied in three separate directions (forward, lateral, and aft). (These test loads represented a fraction of the load that the tank port structure would be subjected to during flight and operation of the snorkel system.) The deflection of the tank port structure was measured as the snorkel was manually pulled away from the port and released back to a static position. The maximum deflection recorded was between 0.03 and 0.05 inches at the tank structure between the hose coupler and the tank face when the snorkel was pulled laterally from the tank. - The wreckage was located in a localized swamp approximately 1,000 ft southeast from the approach end of runway 3. The wreckage was contained in a 31-ft diameter impact crater and had been consumed by fire. Section of all four rotor blades were contained with the main wreckage. The tail rotor remained attached to the vertical stabilizer and was located about 150 ft north-northeast of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\nParts of the newly installed water tank and snorkel assembly were found on the west edge of runway 3. The water pump housing, which was installed near the snorkel inlet, was heavily fragmented. The stainless-steel snorkel suction cage was located about 50 ft west of runway 3 along with a section of main rotor blade. Several pieces of fairings and light material were lodged in the top of trees along the flightpath from the edge of the tree line to the main wreckage. &#x0D;\nThe landing gear, main rotor system, main rotor drive system, engines, hydraulic system, and forward portion of the tail rotor drive system were thermally damaged by the postcrash fire. Most of the cockpit, cabin, and flight controls were consumed by the postcrash fire.&#x0D;\nPortions of the water tank and snorkel hose connecting port were located next to the left main landing gear within the main wreckage. A 10-ft section of the hose assembly (not including the suction pump) was located underneath the forward left side of the fuselage. The upper hose remained attached to the tank snorkel support, and the coupler levers were in the locked position. Portions of the hose had torn away from the tank snorkel support, and the edges were melted. The suction pump and cage were not present on the end of the hose, and the recuperator and fragmented sections of the crown housing remained attached.  Most of the molded front section of the tank was fragmented and was largely destroyed by fire. The snorkel port that extends out of the molded front section of the tank was recovered. Examination of the snorkel port where the metal snorkel attachment fixture (coupler) fastened to the tank snorkel port showed that the gasket between the carbon-fiber flange plate and the tank port structure had torn and separated on the aft side. All the flange fasteners were in place. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On May 18, 2021, about 1430 central daylight time, a Bell OH-58A helicopter, N176SJ, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Ulysses, Kansas. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 aerial application flight.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted a powerline while the pilot was applying chemicals to a field. The operator reported that the accident pass was the pilot’s 21st pass over the field, and that the pilot had been maneuvering over the powerline during the previous passes. The loader who was at the scene reported that the helicopter passed the wires, and he heard two loud pops. The helicopter collided with terrain about 60° nose-low, and the loader called emergency services. - The pilot succumbed to his injuries in the hospital 2 days after the accident. The Kearny County, Kansas, coroner issued a certificate of death and listed the cause of death as massive blunt trauma (to) head, torso, and extremities. Toxicology testing on the pilot’s hospital admission blood was positive for norketamine (metabolite of anesthetic ketamine), famotidine (antacid), and ondansetron (antinausea medication). These medications were likely given to the pilot during postaccident medical treatment. - The helicopter impacted a field and came to rest on its side about 150 yards from the power lines. All major components of the helicopter were located at the accident site. The forward cockpit area was crushed and distorted. Both main rotor blades were damaged and remained attached to the main rotor hub. The main rotor hub was impact separated from the transmission. Flight control continuity was established throughout the helicopter through areas that were fractured with signatures consistent with overload. A portion of the power line was found on the ground between the wire strike location and the wreckage. The helicopter was equipped with wire cutters, but they did not display signatures of damage or wire contact. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot of the helicopter was conducting an aerial application when the accident occurred. Data recovered from an onboard GPS device showed that the helicopter took off, flew to the field, made two full passes and had turned back to begin a third. During the first two passes, the track showed a climb and descent near a power line that spanned the field; however, on the third and final pass, the climb and descent occurred immediately after the final turn and before the power line. The track also showed that, before the data ended, the helicopter was descending toward the power lines in the vicinity of where the wreckage ultimately came to rest. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the wreckage revealed that the tip portion of one of the fractured tail rotor blades exhibited impact scars consistent with a wire strike as well as impact with the tail rotor guard. One tail rotor blade tip was not found. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of preimpact failures or damage that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. It is likely that the helicopter’s tail rotor struck the power line, separating a portion of the tail rotor blades. The tail rotor imbalance resulted in the separation of the tail rotor gearbox and empennage, and a nose-down tendency from the forward center of gravity shift, consistent with the cockpit crushing at ground impact. Given the lack of powered impact signatures on the main rotor blades, it is possible that the pilot reduced the throttle and collective control, resulting in reduced main rotor power, when he experienced a reduced or complete loss of directional control authority after the tail rotor struck the power line.&#x0D;\nThe sun’s elevation at the time of the accident was high enough that it would likely not have been a factor in the pilot’s ability to detect the power line in the field. Given the available information, the pilot likely prematurely descended the helicopter while overflying the power line, which resulted in the subsequent wire strike.",
    "FactualNarrative": "GPS Data Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a GPS navigation device for aerial applications which consisted of a color moving map display of agricultural spray application data and a GPS receiver that fed data to this main display. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe non-volatile memory (NVM) was removed from the device and sent to the GPS manufacturer for processing. The processed data showed the accident flight, which lasted about 2 minutes and 41 seconds. (Figures 2 and 3.) The main wreckage location is shown with a red pin. According to the GPS manufacturer, the data recording could have ended up to 10 seconds before the accident occurred due to data buffering on the device. Review of the data revealed that, during the first two passes, the track showed a climb and descent near the wire; however, on the final southerly pass, the climb and descent occurred immediately after the final turn to the south and before the wire. The track showed that the helicopter was descending toward the power lines where the main wreckage came to rest before the data ended.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 - Flight track of the helicopter (yellow) with the final resting location of the wreckage annotated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3 - Flight track of the helicopter (yellow) with the powerlines annotated (white). - On May 2, 2021, at 1318 eastern daylight time, a Robinson R-44 helicopter, N4528T, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Wingate, North Carolina. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 aerial application flight.&#x0D;\nThe commercial pilot was spraying fungicide on a wheat field when the accident occurred. According to several witnesses, this was the first time they had observed the northwest portion of the field, which contained multiple power lines, being sprayed via aerial application. The helicopter had been applying fungicide all morning, operating about 15 ft above the 3-ft-tall wheat during the spraying operation. The pilot’s wife reported that, after landing, having lunch and loading more fungicide, the pilot departed to begin spraying where he left off. Images of the flight track recovered from an onboard GPS device showed that the helicopter completed its first pass on a northerly heading. The helicopter then turned and flew over the field on a southerly heading, and the track ended in the vicinity of where the main wreckage came to rest. &#x0D;\nWitnesses in a nearby home reported that they heard a loud noise and simultaneously lost electricity to their home. They looked out their window and saw the helicopter as it descended in a nose-down attitude before it impacted the field in the vicinity of the power lines. One of the witnesses stated that it appeared as though the helicopter became entangled in the wires before it descended nose-first into the ground.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted and severed an energized wire, also known as a primary wire, that was oriented about 228° magnetic and measured about 29 ft above ground level at its lowest point over the wheat field. The wire spanned about 345 ft between two utility poles, 264 ft of that span over the wheat field. After the accident occurred, the severed wire was repaired the same day by the utility company. An additional power line spanned another portion of the northwesterly part of the field. - Charlotte-Monroe Executive Airport (EQY) was located about 12 miles northwest of the accident site. At 1253, the reported weather included scattered clouds at 3,800 ft. A review of astronomical data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration revealed that, at the time of the accident, the sun was located at an azimuth of about 180° and an elevation of about 71° from the accident site. - Accident Site Examination&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on its left side. The cockpit and cabin portion of the fuselage was crushed and deformed aft. The tail boom remained attached to the main fuselage; however, the empennage, composed of the upper and lower vertical stabilizers, horizontal stabilizer, the tail rotor and its gearbox, were separated from the tail boom. The windscreen and door windows were separated from the fuselage and fragmented. Both main rotor blades remained attached to the hub and were whole from root to the fractured tips. One main rotor blade was bent downwards about 2 ft outboard of the blade grip, and the other was bent downward and in a “U” shape. The agricultural hopper remained partially attached to the fuselage; it was breached, and its lower side was crushed from impact. The engine compartment and engine remained intact.&#x0D;\nThe empennage was located 99 ft and 336° from the main wreckage. (See Figure 1.) The lower vertical stabilizer sustained trailing edge, semi-circular impact deformation just below the horizontal stabilizer. The tail rotor gearbox was intact but separated from its airframe mount and was located about 112 ft and 208° from the main wreckage. The tail rotor hub remained attached to the tail rotor gearbox output shaft. A 5-inch inboard portion of one tail rotor blade remained attached to its hub; a 14.5-inch midspan section of this blade was found about 170 ft and 44° from the main wreckage. A 13.5-inch inboard portion of the second tail rotor blade remained attached to its hub. The tip end section from one of the fractured tail rotor blades, measuring about 5 inches in length, was located 119 ft and 3° from the main wreckage. The tip portion exhibited impact scars consistent with a wire strike as well as red paint transfer consistent with impact with the red-and-white colored tail rotor guard.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 - Wreckage Diagram&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe and Engine Examination &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll major components of the helicopter were located in the vicinity of the accident site. Examination of the airframe and main rotor system revealed no evidence of preimpact failures. The main drive sheave (pulley) belts were intact and exhibited no evidence of anomalous damage or excessive wear. The clutch (freewheeling unit) functioned normally and continuity of drive from the sheave to the main rotor and tail rotor drive shaft was confirmed. The tail rotor gearbox mounts were fractured and exhibited signatures consistent with overload. Impact deformation to the lower vertical fin was consistent with tail rotor blade contact. The leading edge of the tail rotor blade tip end fractures was deformed in the direction opposite of normal rotation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cyclic and collective controls were present in the main wreckage. The cyclic torque tube was fractured midspan. The left and right roll push-pull tubes remained connected to the aft end of the cyclic torque tube. The fore/aft bellcrank was partially separated and resting on the aft end of the cyclic torque tube. The vertical fore/aft push-pull tube remained connected to the bellcrank. The rod end that connected the fore/aft bell crank to the fork was fractured at the lower end threads with signatures consistent with overload. The base of the cyclic control was not visible due to crushing of the cockpit. The cyclic and collective controls remained connected at their base but could not be moved due to crushing of the cockpit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor control push-pull tubes were continuous from the aft cabin bulkhead to the empennage separation point. The tail rotor controls were not visible forward of the aft cabin bulkhead due to crushing of the cockpit. The right seat pedal set was present in the crushed cockpit. The push-pull tube fracture near the tail gearbox exhibited multiples scores on the tube consistent with contact with the rotating flex plate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded its normal operation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter departed and flew cross-country to begin a powerline patrol, which included flying adjacent to powerlines at an altitude of about 100 ft above ground level and with the helicopter gaining altitude during turns and when flying between line inspections.&#x0D;\nDuring the final minutes of flight, the helicopter was traveling at an airspeed between 50 and 60 kts along powerlines at an altitude between 700 and 775 ft above mean sea level (msl). As the helicopter flew south, near the end of the north-south powerline’s right of way, the helicopter began a climbing right turn towards the west. A utility lineman in the helicopter’s front left seat recalled that the pilot was reversing course and the helicopter was in a banking turn to the right when he heard a very loud noise, “almost cannon-like, very deep, within a second or two we were heading into the trees.” Onboard data recovered from the helicopter showed rotor speed suddenly increased to 107% about 1.5 seconds before the end of recorded data. Examination of the wreckage showed evidence the main rotor blades impacted the tail rotor drive system. Therefore, it is likely the loud noise heard by the onboard lineman was caused by the main rotor blades impacting the tail rotor drive system, resulting in a severance of the tail rotor drive shaft and subsequently a loss of directional control.  Successful recovery of the helicopter after the loss directional control at a low altitude was unlikely and resulted in impact with terrain. Based on analysis of flight data and a scan of the local terrain, it is unlikely the helicopter impacted powerlines or nearby trees at the time the main rotor blades impacted the tail rotor drive system. The loss of clearance between the main rotor and the tail of the helicopter can be caused by sudden aft cyclic control inputs, usually in conjunction with a reduction in collective pitch that would reduce main rotor thrust and increase downward flapping of the blade. The lack of flight control parametric data precluded analysis of flight control inputs at the time the main rotor blade contacted the tail boom. However, it is likely the pilot was not maneuvering to avoid trees based on the increasing distance between the accident helicopter and treetops near the end of the accident flight. Examinations of the helicopter wreckage found no evidence of any preimpact anomalies or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On April 28, 2021, about 1324 eastern standard time, a Bell 429 helicopter, N53DE, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Eden, North Carolina. The commercial pilot was fatally injured, and two passengers were seriously injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 aerial observation flight.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a GPMS Foresight MX Health and Usage Monitoring System (HUMS), which captured data for the accident flight. The HUMS device recorded position, attitude, acceleration, rotor speed (Nr), and engine data. &#x0D;\nThe HUMS data showed the helicopter departed Danville, Virginia, about 1233 and flew cross-country south-west into North Carolina. By 1245, the helicopter was flying a powerline patrol around Eden, North Carolina. The powerline inspection was accomplished at an altitude of about 100 ft above the terrain with the helicopter gaining altitude during turns and when flying between line inspections.&#x0D;\nDuring the final minutes of flight, the helicopter was traveling at an airspeed between 50 and 60 kts parallel to powerlines at an altitude between 700 and 775 ft msl (Figure 1). Nr was near 100%, torque varied between 15% and 25%, and the engine gas generator (N1) speeds were between 84 and 88%.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nFigure 1- Combined map of flight track with corresponding flight parameters.&#x0D;\nA utility lineman seated in the front left seat recalled that the pilot was reversing course and the helicopter was in a banking turn to the right when he heard a very loud noise, “almost cannon-like, very deep, [and] within a second or two we were heading into the trees.” Several ground witnesses nearby observed the accident flight. One witness driving westbound observed the helicopter cross the road heading southbound, flying low over the trees along the powerlines. The helicopter made a right turn before it disappeared behind trees. Two other witnesses observed the helicopter flying from east to west over the trees before making a steep “left turn” as seen from their vantage point; however, as the helicopter pointed toward the witnesses, it was in a right turn. The witnesses stated they could see the underside of the helicopter and skids before it “slid at an angle downward and disappeared into the woods.”&#x0D;\nThe Bell 429 is a light, twin-engine helicopter. It was maintained by the operator under the manufacturer’s recommended inspection program. Log sheet 1071, which was found at the accident site and, although undated, was presumably from the day of the accident, showed that at the start of the day the helicopter had an airframe total time of 283.5 hours and both engines had an engine total time of 283.5 hours. &#x0D;\nThere were abnormalities in the recovered HUMS data that led to the attitude and acceleration data being unreliable for use in this investigation. The accident helicopter was not equipped with, nor was it required to be equipped with a cockpit voice/flight data recorder (CV/FDR), which is an available option offered by Bell. &#x0D;\nThe flight was also recorded by Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). ADS-B broadcasts an aircraft’s Global Positioning System (GPS) position and other data to the ground where it is recorded. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted wooded terrain at an elevation of 570 ft and came to rest on a heading of about 251° magnetic and about 393 ft from the powerlines the crew was observing. All major components of the helicopter were accounted for at the accident site. A post-crash fire occurred and damaged the majority of the fuselage. The overall concentrated debris path was about 200 ft long on a 245° heading with several pieces scattered in multiple directions outside the main debris path. Remnant carbon fiber layup was present in the area of the upper cowlings, fuselage skin, and doors. The cockpit, cabin floor, and the transmission and engine deck were present but sustained heavy thermal damage. The avionics and wiring were strewn outside the nose section, with pieces of wood branches embedded within the wiring.&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub remained attached to the main rotor mast. The two yoke assemblies remained installed with the mast nut intact. The main rotor blades remained installed to their respective grips via blade pins. All blade attachment hardware was present and secured. All four blade tips exhibited impact damage and their spars exhibited a “broom straw” appearance. Three separated leading edge pieces near the tip end, including the tip cap lap joint, were found in the debris field (surrounding the main wreckage). All four main rotor blade pitch horns remained intact, and all four pitch change links were connected to their respective pitch horns and the rotating swashplate. The main rotor transmission was partially separated from the airframe.&#x0D;\nThe tail boom had fractured into multiple pieces, the majority of which were found adjacent to and behind the fuselage. The tail rotor was hanging to one side of the gearbox due to fracturing of the output shaft and bending of the pitch control rod. The two tail rotor yokes remained installed on the tail rotor output shaft and were whole. All four tail rotor blades remained installed on the yokes. None of the tail rotor drive shaft covers remained installed on the tail boom. The horizontal stabilizer remained attached to a separated portion of the tail boom. The left horizontal stabilizer was generally whole with a puncture near the inboard side of its lower surface as well as a puncture near the outboard side of its upper surface. The left finlet remained attached with the lower portion intact and the upper portion fractured and partially separated. The right horizontal stabilizer was generally whole on its inboard end but was fractured at its outboard end. The lower portion of the right finlet was fractured and partially separated, remaining attached only by wiring. The upper portion of the right finlet was fractured and completely separated. The leading edge slats were present on the inboard portions of both left and right horizontal stabilizers but were fractured and separated on their outboard sections. Pieces of blue-colored composite fairing consistent with the tail rotor drive shaft cover were found in the flight path leading up to the main wreckage. The leading edge of the upper vertical fin showed evidence of impact deformation and separation above its attachment point.  &#x0D;\nThe four main rotor blades were reconstructed in their respective positions and laid out by their designated colors, Green, Red, Orange, and Blue (Figure 2). Three separated leading edge pieces near the tip end, including the tip cap lap joint, were found in the debris field surrounding the main wreckage. Two swept tip ends, which were fractured and separated, were reconstructed by the investigation team to the ‘blue’ and ‘orange’ main rotor blades. Two additional swept tip ends, also fractured and separated, exhibited impact damage with a width consistent with contact with the tail rotor drive system aft snubber and belonged to the ‘red’ and ‘green’ main rotor blades (Figure 3). All four swept tip ends were found in the debris field leading up to and around the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2- A reconstruction of the four main rotor blades; From top to bottom, Green, Red, Orange, and Blue.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3- An approximate reconstruction of rotor blade impact damage on the blade tip that is consistent with the dimensions of the snubber housing.&#x0D;\nThe yaw hydraulic actuator remained attached to both the airframe and its control bell crank within the tail boom. The lower portion of the right finlet was fractured and partially separated, remaining attached only by wiring. The upper portion of the right finlet was fractured and completely separated. The leading edge slats were present on the inboard portions of both left and right horizontal stabilizers but were fractured and separated on their outboard sections. Pieces of blue-colored composite fairing consistent with the tail rotor drive shaft cover were found along flight path leading up to the main wreckage. &#x0D;\nThe steel tail rotor drive shaft was continuous to the fan blower shaft. The fan blower shaft and oil cooler blower remained installed on the airframe but were crushed from impact forces. The drive shaft was attached at its forward end to the shaft segment running through the oil cooler blower assembly, one of the lobes (or “ears”) on the adapter assembly was fractured. The forward segmented drive shaft was fractured about 25 inches aft of its forward attachment flange. Two additional pieces from the forward segmented drive shaft were recovered: 1) the midsection of the forward segmented drive shaft, containing the stainless steel snubber sleeve, was found in the wreckage adjacent to the tail boom and 2) the aft section of the forward segmented drive shaft, about 40 inches in length, remained attached to a separated section of the tail boom and remained connected to a forward portion of the aft segmented drive shaft, about 23 inches in length, and the hanger bearing between them. The segmented drive shaft hanger bearing and its mount remained attached to the tail boom. A 34-inch -long section of the aft segmented drive shaft was found embedded near-vertically into the ground, with about 18 inches buried. The aft portion of the 34-inch section of the aft segmented drive shaft exhibited an angled cut (Figure 4).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4 - The 34-inch section of the aft segmented drive shaft, the aft end of which exhibited the angular cut.&#x0D;\nA piece of a tail rotor drive shaft, semi-circular in its cross-section, was found about 172 ft from the main wreckage. Additional multiple smaller fragments of composite tail rotor drive shaft were found in the debris field along the flight path leading up to the main wreckage.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was configured with only the pilot flight controls installed in the right cockpit seat. Various thermally degraded control clevis connections and bell cranks were found in the main wreckage site, but the majority of the cockpit flight control system was consumed by the post-crash fire. None of the connection points between linkages and bell cranks exhibited evidence of fastener disconnection or separation.&#x0D;\nThe three main rotor servo actuators were found separated on the ground near the forward end of the main transmission. All three main rotor servo actuators exhibited thermal damage. The hydraulic lines remained connected to the three servo actuators, allowing for identification of their positions. The tail rotor servo actuator was found in the tail boom wreckage and its hydraulic lines remained connected.&#x0D;\nThe right integrated hydraulic module (IHM) was found on the ground in front of the main transmission and was partially melted. The left IHM was found within the transmission deck wreckage, closer to the swashplate assembly, and was whole but covered in soot and otherwise exhibited no anomalies or debris in the reservoir.&#x0D;\nThe right hydraulic pump was partially melted but the splines and springs, although deformed due to thermal stress, did not show any anomalies. The left hydraulic pump was whole, and its exterior was thermally damaged but remained whole and showed no evidence of anomalous wear. &#x0D;\nThe lateral, longitudinal, and collective flight control servos exhibited thermal damage. The tail rotor servo actuator sustained no thermal damage. The flight control servo actuators were imaged and examined under the direction of the NTSB, and subsequently shipped to Woodward, Inc. for additional teardown examination. Examination of the four servo actuators revealed no preimpact or anomalous damage. All components within the valves were present and all O-rings and backup rings exhibited thermal degradation but were present and no scoring was noted.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with two Pratt and Whitney PW207D1 engines, both of which remained installed on the engine deck. The No. 1 engine exhibited thermal damage, and the No. 2 engine exhibited thermal and impact damage. Both electronic engine controls (EECs) and data collection units (DCUs) for the Nos. 1 and 2 engines were removed for download but usable data could not be retrieved from either of the units due to thermal and impact damage. Postaccident examination of both engines and their respective components revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded their normal operation.&#x0D;\nThe North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Chief Medical Examiner performed the pilot’s autopsy. According to the autopsy report, the cause of death was smoke inhalation and thermal injuries with blunt forces contributing.  &#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory performed toxicological testing of postmortem specimens from the pilot. There were no findings of a contributory nature. &#x0D;\nA performance study was accomplished utilizing the HUMS data along with ADS-B data, weather data, and published Bell performance data. The HUMS data did not record flight control inputs, so the pilot inputs during the final climb and maneuver at the time of the accident were unknown. The helicopter was not near the edge of its operating performance envelope for speed, altitude or temperature and reported weather at the time of the accident was clear with 10 statute miles visibility. &#x0D;\nA LIDAR (“light detection and ranging” or “laser imaging, detecting, and ranging”) scan was conducted in the area of the accident by Duke Energy to record the location of powerlines and surrounding terrain, including the trees. Analysis of the accident flight path using the HUMS data and the LIDAR scan showed the accident helicopter’s distance from the treetops increasing near the end of recorded data. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot departed from his home airport about 13 minutes after sunset under visual flight rules and in visual meteorological conditions. He was not instrument-rated in helicopters, and the helicopter he owned was not approved for flight in instrument conditions. About 1 hour into the flight, the pilot likely encountered snow showers and instrument meteorological conditions that were forecast and moving through the area. Radar data showed that, after entering the area of weather, the pilot began a right, descending turn and the helicopter crashed in a rural, wooded area. The helicopter was destroyed by impact forces and a postimpact fire. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. There was no evidence that the pilot obtained a weather briefing or reviewed the weather prior to or during the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe dark night conditions under the likely overcast skies, the obscuration of the snow showers, and the lack of terrestrial illumination due to being over a remote and wooded area were all conducive to the formation of spatial disorientation. The pilot’s lack of an instrument rating in helicopters, and the helicopter’s lack of equipage for flight instrument meteorological conditions, would also have increased the likelihood of the pilot becoming spatially disoriented. The descending right turn exhibited by the helicopter in the final moments of the flight were consistent with the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation and a subsequent loss of control.",
    "FactualNarrative": "VFR into IMC&#x0D;\nIn April 2003, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) published Advisory Circular 61-134, General Aviation Controlled Flight into Terrain Awareness. The circular stated in part:&#x0D;\nOperating in marginal VFR [visual flight rules]/IMC conditions is more commonly known as scud running. According to National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and FAA data, one of the leading causes of GA accidents is continued VFR flight into IMC. As defined in 14 CFR part 91, ceiling, cloud, or visibility conditions less than that specified for VFR or Special VFR is IMC and IFR [instrument flight rules] applies. However, some pilots, including some with instrument ratings, continue to fly VFR in conditions less than that specified for VFR. The result is often a CFIT [controlled flight into terrain] accident when the pilot tries to continue flying or maneuvering beneath a lowering ceiling and hits an obstacle or terrain or impacts water. The accident may or may not be a result of a loss of control before the aircraft impacts the obstacle or surface. The importance of complete weather information, understanding the significance of the weather information, and being able to correlate the pilot's skills and training, aircraft capabilities, and operating environment with an accurate forecast cannot be emphasized enough. - The helicopter was not approved for flight in instrument meteorological conditions. - On April 22, 2021, about 2104 eastern daylight time, a Robinson Helicopter R44, N4055N, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Forkston, Pennsylvania. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to radar track data from the Federal Aviation Administration, the pilot took off from Allentown Queen City Municipal Airport (XLL), Allentown, Pennsylvania about 2010. He contacted Allentown approach control at 2011 and requested VFR flight-following to Bradford County Airport (N27), Towanda, Pennsylvania. After departure, the helicopter proceeded to the northwest, climbing to a cruise altitude between 3,000 and 4,000 ft above mean sea level (msl), remaining closer to 3,000 ft msl for most of the flight. At 2028, Allentown approach directed the pilot to contact Wilkes-Barre (AVP) approach. The pilot checked in with AVP approach and was issued the local altimeter setting. Shortly after passing Kasson Brook, Pennsylvania, the helicopter made a slight right turn, then entered a right, descending spiral until radar contact was lost about 2104 (see figure 1). The last recorded radar location was near the accident site location. No distress calls were received from the pilot prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 - Helicopter's flight track during the final moments of the flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s widow was interviewed after the accident. She reported that her husband purchased the helicopter about 1 year prior to the accident. He used the helicopter to commute to work at the hospital in Sayre, Pennsylvania. She stated that he had a normal work week prior to the accident; meals and rest were also normal. The pilot departed for the hospital later than he normally would have on the night of the accident. Flying at night was not an issue for her husband. - According to autopsy report from the Office of the Coroner, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, the cause of death of the pilot was blunt force trauma due to helicopter crash and the manner of death was accident. The examination to identify any natural disease was limited by extensive trauma. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory detected ethanol in the pilot’s liver tissue at 0.048 grams per hectogram (gm/hg) and n-butanol in the pilot’s liver tissue; no other tested for drugs were detected in his muscle tissue.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEthanol is a social drug commonly consumed by drinking beer, wine, or liquor. It acts as a central nervous system depressant; it impairs judgment, psychomotor functioning, and vigilance. Ethanol is water soluble, and after absorption it quickly and uniformly distributes throughout the body’s tissues and fluids. The distribution pattern parallels water content and blood supply of the tissue. Ethanol can be produced after death by microbial activity, sometimes in conjunction with other alcohols such as butanol. Extensive trauma increases the spread of bacteria and raises the risk of ethanol production after death. - The National Weather Service (NWS) Surface Analysis Chart centered over the eastern United States for 2000 depicted a trough located from northcentral Pennsylvania to southwestern Pennsylvania. There were no low- or high-pressure systems located near the accident site. The accident site was located east of the surface trough. Troughs can act as lifting mechanisms to help produce clouds and precipitation if sufficient moisture is present.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGreater Binghamton, New York Airport (BGM) was located 44 miles north of the accident site at an elevation of 1,636 ft. The 2053 observation included wind from 310° at 5 knots, 1 ½ statute miles visibility, with light snow, a broken ceiling at 4,300 ft, and overcast skies at 5,500 ft. The 2121 observation included wind from 300° at 8 knots, 1 ½ statute miles visibility, with light snow and mist, a broken ceiling at 2,900 ft, broken skies at 3,800 ft, and overcast skies at 5,000 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of recorded Doppler radar data revealed a band of precipitation (snow showers) moving across the area of the accident site at the accident time. The NWS office in Binghamton issued an area forecast at 1953 for the area that included lake effect snow showers moving across the region. AIRMETs active at the time included mountain obscuration, moderate turbulence, and moderate icing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident pilot did not request weather information from Leidos Flight Service or ForeFlight. There is no record of the pilot receiving or retrieving any other weather information before or during the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the accident site, sunset was 1953 and the end of civil twilight was 2023. At the time of the accident, the moon was located at an altitude of 60.66° and azimuth of 160.80° with 77.7% of the moon visible disk illuminated. - The pilot’s 208 hours of logged flight time in helicopters were split equally between R22 and R44 models. He began his helicopter training in the R22 and transitioned to the R44 after he purchased the accident helicopter in June 2020. He obtained his rotorcraft-helicopter rating in the accident helicopter on September 19, 2020. The pilot held an instrument rating in airplanes but not in helicopters. - The helicopter collided with trees and terrain in a remote, wooded area. The wreckage was recovered to a storage facility where an examination was conducted by a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) air safety investigator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aluminum and fiberglass structure of the fuselage and cabin were consumed by a postaccident fire. The forward end of the tailcone and empennage were mostly consumed by fire. The horizontal and vertical firewalls were deformed from impact and heat distress. The cyclic, collective, and antitorque pedals were fractured, deformed, and thermally damaged and were no longer attached to the structure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel tank bladders and shells were completely consumed by postaccident fire. Both filler caps were secure on their filler necks. Both finger strainers were clean and unobstructed. The fuel lines and hoses were damaged by postaccident fire. The fuel valve was found in the ON position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub remained attached to the driveshaft. Both main rotor blades were cut by recovery personnel. Both blades exhibited impact damage to the leading edges and multiple fractures were observed throughout the length of the blades. The tail rotor blades sustained impact and thermal damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMost of the flight control tubes in the cabin and airframe areas were consumed by postaccident fire. All connections to the main rotor controls were accounted for, and all but three of the rod ends for the tail rotor controls were accounted for. The visible disconnects at the rod ends displayed either overload or thermal damage. The hydraulic servos moved smoothly by hand.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine separated from the airframe and exhibited heat and impact damage throughout. The engine was suspended from a lift and partially disassembled to facilitate the examination. The engine accessories were removed, and the crankshaft was rotated by turning the cooling fan. All six pistons were observed to move in their respective cylinder bores; however, the intake and exhaust valves were not observed to move as the crankshaft was rotated. Compression and suction were observed from the cylinders where both the intake and exhaust valves were closed. Observation of the crankshaft gear through the magneto mount openings in the accessory case revealed that the crankshaft gear did not rotate as the crankshaft was rotated. The head of the crankshaft gear bolt was observed raised about 1/8 inch above the crankshaft gear. The bolt safety washer was in place.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accessory case was removed, and the crankshaft gear dowel pin was sheared, consistent with sudden stoppage of the accessory gears at impact. The crankshaft gear bolt was removed and was unbroken. The bolt head was damaged, consistent with contact with the oil pump drive. The first 3/16 inch of the bolt threads were damaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe crankshaft gear, crankshaft gear bolt, and safety washer were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for examination. By design, the crankshaft gear contained a hole in its pilot flange that interfaced with an alignment dowel that was press-fit into a counterbored recess on the aft end of the crankshaft. The alignment dowel had fractured, and the separated piece of the dowel was captured in the pilot flange hole. All components (except the tip of the bolt) had dark-tinted surfaces, including the dowel fragment’s fracture surface, consistent with exposure to elevated temperatures. The tip of the bolt had a shiny appearance and stripped threads, consistent with damage during extraction of the bolt. All surfaces were examined for indications of burnishing, rubbing, or wear, but none were found. The dowel’s fracture surface had a flat, featureless appearance, with no apparent crack arrest marks. Shear lips were observed along the radially inward and outward edges of the fracture surface. The chamfer around the pilot flange hole exhibited deformation and metal transfer at the leading edge (the edge that leads during rotating of the crankshaft/gear assembly). The features were consistent with an overstress fracture of the dowel in shear and bending.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "A local lodge had contracted with the helicopter operator to transport passengers from a private residence to a heli-ski area at a nearby mountain. The surviving passenger stated that, before the last ski run of the day, the pilot attempted to land on a ridgeline but that the helicopter lifted off for an attempted second landing. The passenger also stated that, during the second landing attempt, the snow was “real light” but that the helicopter became “engulfed in a fog which made it appear like a little white room.” The helicopter subsequently began “going backward real fast” and impacted the ridgeline and rolled backward down the mountain.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. The passenger’s recollection of the conditions just before the accident was consistent with whiteout conditions caused by rotor wash while the helicopter was hovering near the ridgeline. Thus, the pilot likely experienced whiteout conditions during the second landing attempt, which caused him to lose visual reference with the ridgeline and resulted in the helicopter impacting terrain. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTitle 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 required flight-locating for the helicopter in case it was overdue so that information about the helicopter’s location could be reported to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or a search and rescue facility. The helicopter operator stated that it had delegated the responsibility for flight-locating to the local lodge. However, this delegation was not documented in the company’s FAA operations specifications or general operations manual, as required by Part 135. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the day of the accident, the local lodge was providing flight-following for the accident helicopter, which, unlike flight-locating, was not required by Part 135. The helicopter was expected to depart the heli-ski area for the principal operations base once all the ski runs had been completed. The flight-follower informed his supervisor that 40 minutes had elapsed since the helicopter moved from its last recorded position and that there had been “no positive comms” with the ski guide during the last 1.5 hours; this notification was made 41 minutes after the last “ping” from the helicopter. However, the remote area in which the accident flight was operating had limited communication capabilities, and no clear evidence indicated that an accident had occurred. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight-follower’s supervisor contacted another heli-ski company to help determine the status of the helicopter. The heli-ski company considered the flight to be “ops normal” and expected that the last lift would occur shortly. The supervisor instructed the flight-follower to “keep an eye on” the accident helicopter; however, the lodge’s emergency response plan stated that a search and rescue facility should be contacted “if communication with the helicopter is not established by the end of the prearranged [time] or 30-minute grace period.” Therefore, it would have been reasonable for the lodge to activate its emergency response plan at this point given that the helicopter’s location was unknown at the time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight-follower continued to try to reach the helicopter but was unsuccessful. About 90 minutes after the last flight-following “ping” for the helicopter, the lodge received erroneous information from the heli-ski operator that the accident helicopter was “inbound” for the private residence; however, lodge personnel did not realize that this information was not accurate and that the accident had occurred immediately after the last ping. This incorrect information likely played a role in the lodge’s further delay in activating its emergency response plan.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1 hour and 50 minutes after the accident (and the last flight-following ping), the heli-ski operator notified the accident helicopter operator about the overdue aircraft. Five minutes later, the lodge notified the helicopter operator that it was activating its emergency response plan. About 2 hours after the accident occurred, the helicopter operator activated its emergency response plan. About 17 minutes later, the helicopter operator notified the Alaska Rescue Coordination Center. The director of operations for the helicopter operator stated that the search and rescue notification did not occur before that time because he had been “working through the information that was provided” about the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter wreckage was located about 3.5 hours after the accident. Rescue personnel launched within 1 hour of notification and arrived on scene less than 30 minutes later (about 5 hours 40 minutes after the accident). The surviving passenger was transported via helicopter to a local hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital, the surviving passenger had hypothermia and severe frostbite. A shorter exposure to the cold would likely have decreased the severity of the surviving passenger’s injuries. However, a faster emergency response time (and thus shorter exposure to the cold) could only have occurred if the notification to search and rescue personnel had been timelier. Thus, because the lodge and the helicopter operator did not activate their emergency response plans sooner, the initiation of search and rescue operations was delayed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGiven the circumstances of this accident, the investigation considered three types of training that the pilot should have received: inadvertent instrument meteorological conditions (IIMC) training; controlled flight into terrain-avoidance (CFIT-A) training, during which instruction in whiteout conditions would be conducted; and ridgeline training. Review of the operator’s pilot training program showed that ridgeline training was not provided for the make and model of the accident helicopter (or the previous helicopter in which the accident pilot had been trained). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther, IIMC training was a part of CFIT-A training, and the CFIT-A manual stated that pilots were required to complete IIMC training annually. However, the chief pilot for the helicopter operator stated that the related test for pilots (to demonstrate understanding of the subject) was only administered when a pilot was first hired, and the director of operations stated that the company’s only IIMC flight training involved recovery from unusual attitudes. In addition, review of the accident pilot’s flight training records found that he completed IIMC training 14 months before the accident (which was about 1 year after he began working for the operator), but the records did not reflect the specific IIMC training that the pilot received. Based upon the information provided by the operator, it could not be determined if the accident pilot had fulfilled the training requirement.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe director of operations reported that the helicopter operator did not accomplish flight training as part of its CFIT-A training; however, flight training was not required for that subject, and the pilot received CFIT-A ground training. The CFIT-A manual stated that, if inadvertent whiteout conditions were encountered, the pilot was to rely on flight instruments and carefully attempt to maneuver the helicopter away from obstacles and terrain. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditional review of training records revealed that, during competency checks, the helicopter operator was not evaluating several requirements of 14 CFR 135.293, including recovery from IIMC, navigation, air traffic control communication, and instrument approach flying. Paragraph (c) of the regulation required a pilot to demonstrate the ability to maneuver the helicopter into visual meteorological conditions after a simulated encounter with IIMC, a skill that was needed during the accident flight. The operator stated that it did not have any instrument-flight-rules (IFR) aircraft capable of IFR approaches, but the GPS model installed on the accident helicopter had IFR capabilities with instrument approach procedures in its database. Thus, given the deficiencies in the operator’s pilot training program and Part 135 checkrides, particularly regarding IIMC, it is likely that the pilot did not meet the qualification standards to be the pilot in-command of the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA principal operations inspector (POI) for the operator failed to ensure that the company’s operations specifications (specifically, paragraph A008) contained the operational control information required by 14 CFR 119.7 and 135.77. (Flight-locating was part of operational control.) The company’s operations specifications did not describe who would be responsible for the safe operation of company flights and how those flights would be operated to meet requirements; thus, the operations specifications were incomplete. Although the company should have noticed this omission before the operational specifications were signed, the POI was ultimately responsible for ensuring that the operations specifications contained all the required information.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Order 8900.1, paragraph 3-1255, discusses helicopter flight training maneuvers that “must be conducted for satisfactory completion of each category of flight training.” The order also stated that all helicopter pilots operating under Part 135 “must be trained on procedures for the avoidance and recovery from IIMC” and that inspectors were required to ensure that operational procedures for recovery from IIMC are incorporated into the certificate holder’s training curriculums. Thus, the POI failed to ensure that the operator’s training program contained all required elements, which also included ridgeline training, before approving the training program. In addition, the POI was also unaware that the operator was not conducting competency checks in accordance with section 135.293(c) and that its checkrides were only assessing a pilot’s recovery from unusual attitudes. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFrom 2011 to 2013, the POI was the chief pilot for the accident operator; from 2001 to 2011, she worked at another helicopter company with the person who later became the president of the accident operator. The POI started her employment with the FAA in 2016 and, 2 years later, became the POI for the accident operator. The available evidence for this investigation was insufficient to determine whether the POI’s previous employment history was a factor in the inadequate oversight of the accident operator.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing of specimens from the senior lead ski guide identified two central nervous system stimulant drugs: amphetamine and cocaine. Given the drug levels measured in his blood, the senior lead ski guide was likely impaired by drug effects at the time of the accident. Toxicology testing of specimens from the other lead ski guide identified delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component in cannabis. The low THC level measured in his blood indicates that he was not likely experiencing significant impairment from THC effects at the time of the accident. Although ski guides are not considered crewmembers according to the Federal Aviation Regulations, they have safety-related responsibilities during heli-ski flights such as coordinating with pilots about landing and pickup zones and assisting pilots with hazard and pickup zone identification. However, the investigation was unable to determine whether the senior lead guide’s illicit drug use played a role in the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Heli-Ski Guides&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo passengers aboard the accident flight were heli-ski guides who TML contracted for the accident flight. Guides provide a critical safety role during a flight, and their responsibilities can include loading and unloading passengers, understanding surface snow conditions, and coordinating with pilots about landing and pickup zones. The HSUS operating guidelines specify duties for guides during the approach and landing, which include assisting the pilot with hazard and pickup zone identification, confirming clearances to terrain features on short final, and ensuring passenger safety after landing. TML offered annual training to heli-ski guides working at its operation each season, which the accident guides attended in January 2021. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTML was listed on the HSUS website as a member at the time of the accident. HSUS designated the accident guides as lead guides. According to HSUS, a lead guide is “an individual designated by an Outfitter to supervise the activities of one or more Groups and who meets the recommended qualifications for that position as established in the Guide Qualification Guidelines.” One of the accident guides was designated as the senior lead guide for the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight-Locating Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSoloy Helicopters had delegated flight-locating responsibilities to TML. The NTSB requested that the FAA provide a definition or clarification for the term “flight locating” given that the Federal Aviation Regulations did not define that term. The FAA acknowledged that “flight locating” is not defined but stated that 14 CFR 135.79, Flight Locating Requirements, stated that procedures were required to be established for locating each flight for which an FAA flight plan is not filed. The regulation specified the following procedures: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1. Provide the certificate holder with at least the information required to be included in a VFR flight plan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n2. Provide for timely notification of an FAA facility or search and rescue facility, if an aircraft is overdue or missing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n3. Provide the certificate holder with the location, date, and estimated time for reestablishing communications, if the flight will operate in an area where communications cannot be maintained.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe regulation also required that flight-locating information be retained at the certificate holder's principal place of business, or at another place designated by the certificate holder in its flight-locating procedures, until the completion of each flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight-following was not defined for Part 135 operations and was not required for aircraft operating under Part 135. The term “flight follower” generally refers to personnel who perform various flight support duties. - The accident helicopter was equipped with a Garmin Aera 660 GPS, which was certified for visual flight rules (VFR) flight but had the capability to display IFR procedures and maps. The helicopter was also equipped with a Kannad 406-MHz AF Compact emergency locator transmitter (ELT) that was installed on the upper right side of the right baggage compartment. - On March 27, 2021, about 1836 Alaska daylight time, an Airbus Helicopters AS350-B3, N351SH, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Palmer, Alaska. The pilot and four passengers were fatally injured, and one passenger was seriously injured. The helicopter was operated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 as an on-demand air charter flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRepresentatives from the operator, Soloy Helicopters, reported that the helicopter was under contract to Tordrillo Mountain Lodge (TML) to transport passengers from a private residence on Wasilla Lake, Wasilla, Alaska, to the Chugach Mountains to conduct heli-ski operations. (The Organizational and Management section of this report provides additional information about Soloy Helicopters and TML.) According to Heli Ski US (HSUS), which is a trade association that promotes helicopter skiing safety and provides support, heli-ski operations involve a “helicopter [that] is utilized to provide up-hill transportation for participants” of “guided winter recreation activities including, but not limited to skiing.” &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGPS data showed that the helicopter arrived at the Wasilla Lake residence about 1450. About 53 minutes later, the helicopter departed the residence and flew toward the Chugach Mountains. The surviving passenger recalled “nice” but “kind of creepy weather” in the mountains, which delayed the departure for the ski trip. The helicopter arrived at the intended operating area about 19 minutes later and subsequently flew multiple runs between about 1612 and 1807. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGPS data showed that the helicopter departed for the last run of the day at 1827:05 on a northwest heading and climbed to about 5,900 ft mean sea level (msl). The helicopter's final movements began about 1833 over a ridgeline at an altitude of 6,266 ft msl (about 14 ft above ground level) and at a groundspeed of 1 knot. The helicopter maintained its low altitude and groundspeed as it maneuvered over the ridgeline. The data track ceased at 1836:42 near the location of the accident site, which is shown in figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Location of departure point, previous operating areas, and the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe surviving passenger stated that the passengers had completed five or six runs and that the accident occurred while the helicopter was relocating for the last run of the day. The surviving passenger also stated that the pilot first attempted to land the helicopter normally on the ridgeline but that the helicopter subsequently “went up to try to get into the right position.” The surviving passenger further stated that the snow was “real light” and that, while the pilot was attempting to land a second time, the helicopter was “engulfed in a fog, which made it appear like a little white room.” The passenger recalled that another passenger yelled “don’t do it” three times just before the helicopter “began going backward real fast and impacted the rocky mountainside several times.” - Pilot &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe State of Alaska Medical Examiner’s Office in Anchorage performed an autopsy of the pilot. His cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries. Toxicology testing performed by the FAA’s Forensic Sciences Laboratory detected no tested for substances.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSki Guides&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the autopsy inspection report (which comprised an external examination only) issued by the State of Alaska Medical Examiner’s Office, the senior lead guide’s cause of death was blunt force head injury. Toxicology tests performed by NMS Labs identified the following in the senior lead guide’s blood specimen: amphetamine at 96 ng/ml, cocaine at 52 ng/ml, and the inactive cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine at 1,000 ng/ml.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe autopsy inspection report for the other lead guide showed that his cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries. Toxicology tests of the lead guide’s blood specimen performed by NMS Labs identified delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive component in cannabis, at 1.1 ng/ml.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAmphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant drug that is available by prescription for the treatment of attention deficit disorder and narcolepsy. It carries a boxed warning about its potential for abuse and has warnings about an increased risk of sudden death and the potential for mental health and behavioral changes. In some preparations, a prescription drug is metabolized to amphetamine; commonly marketed names include Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse. Amphetamine may also be produced and used illicitly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCocaine is another central nervous system stimulant drug. Initial effects of cocaine use include euphoria, excitation, general arousal, dizziness, increased focus, and alertness. At higher doses, effects can include psychosis, confusion, delusions, hallucinations, fear, antisocial behavior, and aggressiveness. Late effects, beginning within 1 to 2 hours after use, include depression, agitation, nervousness, drug craving, fatigue, and insomnia. Additional performance effects would be expected after higher doses, with chronic ingestion, and during drug withdrawal, including agitation, anxiety, distress, inability to focus on divided-attention tasks, inability to follow directions, confusion, hostility, time distortion, and poor balance and coordination. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTHC's mood-altering effects include euphoria and relaxation. Also, THC can cause alterations in motor behavior, perception, cognition, memory, learning, endocrine function, food intake, and body temperature regulation. Specific performance effects may include a decreased ability to concentrate and maintain attention. In addition, impairment in retention time and tracking, subjective sleepiness, distortion of time and distance, vigilance, and loss of coordination in divided-attention tasks have been reported. Significant performance impairments are usually observed for at least 1 to 2 hours after marijuana use, and residual effects can occur for up to 24 hours. THC may be detected at low levels in the blood for days or weeks after use. - At 1600, the Anchorage, Alaska, upper air sounding wind profile indicated light surface wind from the north above the surface with little directional variation with height and increasing wind speed. At an altitude of about 6,000 ft, the wind was from 350° at 21 knots with a temperature of -17°C. The sounding was characterized as conditionally unstable below 6,000 ft and stable above that level. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Universal Rawinsonde Observation analysis program sounding supported light turbulence below 8,000 ft and mountain wave activity. The northerly wind south of the ridgeline (the accident location) would have resulted in a general downslope wind flow near the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA pilot operating on Knik Glacier (near the accident site) a few hours before the accident reported light surface wind with stronger wind at altitude. This pilot indicated that it “was windy as heck at altitude but dead calm on the valley floor.” A snowmobile tour operator at Knik Glacier reported that, during the morning and afternoon tours on the day of the accident, he noticed large plumes of snow blowing off the nearby mountain peaks, and he estimated the wind to be between 30 to 40 miles per hour from the west. - Soloy Helicopters&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSoloy Helicopters is a Part 135 air carrier that conducted rotorcraft on-demand operations. At the time of the accident, Soloy Helicopters operated 17 helicopters and employed about 20 pilots, some of whom were seasonal. In addition, Soloy Helicopters conducted operations under Parts 133 (rotorcraft external-load operations) and 137 (agricultural aircraft operations).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot Training Program&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSoloy’s CFIT-A training manual, dated December 12, 2016, outlined the company’s CFIT&#x1E;A policies, procedures, and training requirements and stated that CFIT-A training was required as part of initial and recurrent training. Training topics included whiteout conditions, flat-light conditions, deteriorating visibility, IIMC, advanced aircraft systems, and normal and abnormal/emergency procedures. Some of the training was conducted with a desktop computer. The CFIT-A training manual also stated the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIf inadvertent white out conditions are encountered it is important to rely on instrument indications and carefully attempt to fly away from obstacles and terrain until visible references can be re-established. If visible references cannot be reestablished then proceed as inadvertent IMC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Soloy Helicopters’ chief pilot, as part of CFIT-A training, the company administered a test to newly hired pilots to ensure mastery of the subject matter, but subsequent training was discussion-based only. The director of operations stated that the company did not accomplish flight training for CFIT-A (which was not required). Further, other than the instruction included in the CFIT-A training manual, Soloy Helicopters’ training program contained no specific IIMC training module. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company’s training program contained a module titled “Abnormal and Emergency Procedures.” This module comprised the following elements: maneuvering by instruments (for aircraft equipped with navigational radios), controlled flight by reference to instruments, intercepting and tracking a course, and recovery from unusual attitudes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn addition, the AS350 maneuvers guide, which was also part of the company’s training program, had a module titled “Maneuvering by Reference to Instruments.” The objective of the module was “to provide practice in the methods and procedures of maneuvering the aircraft by instruments and to recognize and recover from unusual attitudes.” The training applied to cruise flight, straight-and-level flight, standard rate turns, navigation, and unusual attitudes. The company’s director of operations stated that IIMC flight training consisted only of unusual attitude training.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSoloy Helicopter’s pilot training program for the AS350 and Hughes 500 (the two helicopters for which the accident pilot was qualified) did not include training in unprepared site operations involving ridgelines. The pilot’s records also did not show any documented training specifically for ridgeline operations. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight Checks&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Soloy Helicopters director of operations indicated that the only IIMC training that was typically part of the competency check involved recognition of and recovery from unusual attitudes. The chief pilot stated that only unusual attitudes were assessed as part of the flight check required by 14 CFR 135.293(b) because the company did not have any IFR aircraft capable of IFR approaches. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTitle 14 CFR 135.293(b) stated in part the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe competency check may include any of the maneuvers and procedures currently required for the original issuance of the particular pilot certificate required for the operations authorized and appropriate to the category, class and type of aircraft involved…. For the purposes of this paragraph, type, as to a helicopter, means a basic make and model.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nParagraph (c) of 14 CFR 135.293 states the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEach competency check given in a rotorcraft must include a demonstration of the pilot's ability to maneuver the rotorcraft solely by reference to instruments. The check must determine the pilot's ability to safely maneuver the rotorcraft into visual meteorological conditions following an inadvertent encounter with instrument meteorological conditions. For competency checks in non-IFR-certified rotorcraft, the pilot must perform such maneuvers as are appropriate to the rotorcraft's installed equipment, the certificate holder's operations specifications, and the operating environment. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to postaccident interviews and operator documentation, Soloy Helicopters used FAA form 8410-3 (issued in 1981) to conduct pilot competency checks. The form did not include all training requirements, so flight instructors documented those requirements within the remarks section of the form.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHeli-Skiing Guidance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSoloy Helicopters provided pilots with Standard Operating Guidelines for heli-skiing operations. These guidelines, dated March 1, 2012, stated the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhenever possible the guidelines outlined within this document should be followed. Deviations from these guidelines should only be considered when operational circumstances occur that necessitate changes due to safety, unforeseen circumstances or the impracticality of any written procedure. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSection 600 of the guidelines, Operational Concerns, stated, in part, the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOperations will not be conducted unless the pilot has positive visual reference during all phases of flight [emphasis in original]…. All landings should be to previously staked areas or areas that have adequate visual reference to determine slope, surface, snow conditions, hazards, touchdown spot, abort flight path, etc. Considerations should be paid to: 1) Approaches and departures; 2) Proximity to hazards, avalanche chutes, cornice build-up, down flowing etc. 3) Prevailing wind.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSection 800, Passenger Briefing discussed, in part, the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt is the responsibility of the pilot-in-command to ensure every guest is given a comprehensive briefing prior to initial flight. Briefings may be given by another designated and trained person (i.e. guides) or a combination video/practical method, provided all aspects of a briefing are covered. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe section also stated that “guides are essential to the briefings,” and the guidelines discussed the topics that were required to be provided during an initial safety briefing, including the operation of all doors and emergency exits, use of seat belts at all times, procedures in case of accident, and location and use of the ELT and first aid kit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOperational Control for Flight Operations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to 14 CFR Part 1, operational control regarding a flight refers to the exercise of authority over initiating, conducting, or terminating a flight. The certificate holder is required to have an operational control system that includes all the elements of operational control. In addition, 14 CFR Part 135 requires operators to have a system and/or procedures for the control of flight movements.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nReview of Soloy Helicopters’ Operations Specifications, paragraph A008, Operational Control, which was valid at the time of the accident, showed that the specifications had been digitally signed by the FAA POI and issued to the operator on February 8, 2019. The intent of paragraph A008 was to ensure a mutual understanding between an operator and the FAA concerning the operational control system and/or procedures used by the operator. Paragraph A stated the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe [operational control] system described or referenced below in this subparagraph must be used by the certificate holder that conducts operations under 14 CFR Part 135 to provide operational control for its flight operations. The essential elements of operational control…must be included or described in that system. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSoloy Helicopters’ operational control system was not described or referenced in the operations specifications. Title 14 CFR 119.7 states, in part, that each certificate holder’s operations specifications must contain the authorizations, limitations, and procedures under which operations are to be conducted.  Title 14 CFR 135.77, Responsibility for Operational Control states, in part, the following: “each certificate holder is responsible for operational control and shall list…the name and title of each person authorized by it to exercise operational control.” &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of Soloy’s GOM revealed that, in section 1, management personnel were listed by name and included the director of operations, chief pilot, and director of maintenance. Only the director of operations had operational control as a listed duty, responsibility, or authority. Section 2 showed that only the director of operations had operational control. No chain of command or other list of authorized personnel appeared in section 2. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a postaccident interview, the director of operations stated that he was the only company individual with operational control. The director of operations added that he could delegate that responsibility to the chief executive officer, even though this transfer was not listed in the GOM or operations specifications.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSoloy Helicopters’ operations specifications did not indicate that the company had delegated the responsibility for flight-locating to TML. The company’s GOM stated, under the Flight Assignment Procedures heading, that “a qualified Flight Locator may accomplish…flight assignment tasks either by delegation from the DO [director of operations] or in the temporary absence of the DO.” The term “flight locator” was not defined in the GOM, and no personnel names were associated with this position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOverdue Aircraft Procedures &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Soloy Helicopters GOM stated that an aircraft would be considered overdue when it was 60 minutes beyond the latest estimated time of arrival. The Soloy Helicopters emergency response plan stated that an aircraft would be considered overdue “30 minutes Beyond Camp or FAA flight plan.” The Soloy Helicopters safety management system manual stated that the emergency response plan should be initiated due to, among other things, “an overdue or missing Soloy Helicopters aircraft.” The manual continued, “a Soloy Helicopters aircraft is considered overdue if it is more than 60 minutes” beyond its estimated time of arrival or agreed-upon reporting time and that “personnel in the field should use 30 minutes as a guide to begin referencing” the plan. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration Oversight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrincipal Operations Inspector for Operator &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe POI for Soloy Helicopters at the time of the accident had been employed with the Anchorage Flight Standards District Office since 2016 and became the POI for Soloy Helicopters in 2018. She was also responsible for the oversight of six other Part 135 certificates. Before her employment with the FAA, she was the chief pilot at Soloy (between 2011 and 2013), and she worked at another helicopter operator (from 2001 to 2011) with the person who would later become the president of the Soloy Helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe POI stated that she visited Soloy Helicopters about 1 year before the accident, possibly for a check airman observation. The POI also stated that she conducted a flight operations observation in December 2020 and an operational control inspection, which included flight-locating, during the third quarter of 2020. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of FAA safety assurance system records beginning March 2018 (3 years before the accident) revealed that, from September 11, 2018, to June 16, 2021, 13 surveillance assessments of Soloy Helicopters were completed, 12 of which had been closed with no issues or findings. The record of the other assessment indicated a minor nonregulatory issue and had a status of “closed pending action.” During the same timeframe, six surveillance assessments had been automatically closed because they were overdue and not in an “ready status.” Additional records showed that the POI visited Soloy on November 14, 2019, and October 30, 2020, to conduct check airman surveillance and line checks. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a postaccident interview, the POI stated that she had not observed any heli-ski operations in her current position. (The POI stated that she had observed those operations while she was employed by Soloy Helicopters.) In addition, the POI did not recall making any recommendations to Soloy for changes to its manuals or procedures (in her capacity as the POI for Soloy certificate). The POI further stated that she had asked other FAA inspectors to conduct checkrides at Soloy on her behalf because she was not medically qualified for that responsibility. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the POI, flight-locating was a part of operational control, and the list of company personnel with operational control was in the company’s GOM. The POI also stated that the lodge personnel who would be performing flight-locating tasks did not need to be named in the company’s Operations Specifications paragraph A008 or its GOM. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRegarding CFIT-A training, the POI stated that the training was conducted “in the mountains, in bad weather” and that she did not normally observe that training. The POI also stated that she had observed some ground training “probably” in 2019. The POI thought that IIMC recovery was not a required training item. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration Order 8900.1&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Order 8900.1, Flight Standards Information Management System, is “the repository of all Flight Standards policy and guidance concerning aviation safety inspector job tasks.” The order was primarily intended for “Flight Standards aviation safety inspectors, their managers and supervisors, and other operational and administrative employees.” Operators can use the order as a reference. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nParagraph 3 1255 of the order, Part 135 Pilot-in-Command/Second-in-Command Flight Training (All Training Categories) – Helicopters, listed certain maneuvers that “must be conducted for satisfactory completion of each category of flight training.” The order stated that pilots in command must complete each training event listed in the paragraph, which included “unprepared site operations: ridgelines.” The paragraph stated that a POI should ensure that the certificate holder’s flight training emphasized operations in various environments, including mountainous areas. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nParagraph 3-1256, IIMC Training, stated that all pilots operating helicopters under Part 135 must be trained on procedures for avoiding and recovering from IIMC and that inspectors would evaluate the certificate holder’s operational procedures for this training and ensure that these procedures were incorporated into the certificate holder’s initial, transition, upgrade, and recurrent training curriculums. The order further stated that “training should emphasize the identification of circumstances likely to lead to IIMC encounters and encourage the pilot to abandon a planned flightpath or route to avoid continued VFR flight into deteriorating conditions.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nParagraph 3-1256 also stated the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecovery from IIMC is an emergency maneuver since the pilot would be operating under VFR prior to the IIMC. The recovery from IIMC must include attitude instrument flying, recovery from unusual attitudes, navigation, ATC [air traffic control] communications, and at least one instrument approach, if the helicopter is appropriately equipped…. IIMC training should include visual cues and unusual conditions, which should prompt pilot action to avoid an IIMC encounter and pilot reaction plans to divert, land, or initiate an emergency transition to IFR as appropriate to the situation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTable 3-71 in the order showed the requirement for helicopter IIMC recovery. A note to the table stated, “this event must include attitude instrument flying, recovery from unusual attitudes, navigation, air traffic control (ATC) communications, and at least 1 instrument (if aircraft is so equipped) approach appropriate to circumstances.” Soloy Helicopters had not incorporated each training subject into its training program, and no record was found that showed that either Soloy Helicopters or the FAA had requested a deviation or waiver from this requirement for approval of Soloy’s training program.&#x0D;\n  &#x0D;\nFAA Order 8900.1 also contained guidance for determining the acceptability of a certificate holder’s flight-locating procedures. The order required the operator’s notification of an overdue or missing aircraft to be at least as prompt as notifications provided by FAA procedures and facilities (30 minutes). Further, paragraph 3-2023 of the order stated that, when operations were conducted in an area where radio contact cannot be maintained with ATC, the individual authorized to exercise operational control must be provided with the location, date, and estimated time at which the pilot-in-command would re-establish radio or telephone communications. The order indicated that operators should maintain sufficient records to show compliance with these requirements. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn addition, paragraph 3-2023 of the order stated that Part 135 operators could contract with other operators or organizations to perform direct operational control functions but that the operator would remain fully responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable regulations, the GOM, and safe operating practices. The name of each contractor employee authorized to perform these functions for the operator must be listed in the operator’s GOM. The order also stated that operators were responsible for ensuring that individuals authorized to exercise operational control are adequately trained to perform their assigned duties and are knowledgeable of, and have access to, appropriate sections of the operator’s GOM while performing their assigned duties.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSoloy Helicopters had not incorporated these requirements into its flight-locating procedures. No record was located during the investigation that showed that either Soloy Helicopters or the FAA had requested a deviation or waiver from these requirements for acceptance of the GOM. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTordrillo Mountain Lodge&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTML‘s emergency response plan stated that a search and rescue facility (specifically, the 210th Rescue Squadron of the Alaska ANG located at Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson in Anchorage) should be contacted “if communication with the helicopter is not established by the end of the prearranged or 30 minute grace period.”&#x0D;\n  &#x0D;\nIn September 2021, TML provided the NTSB with a written summary about its drug and alcohol policy for its pilots and guides, which was included in the TML employee handbook, dated July 2020. TML’s summary stated the following:&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nPilots must follow the policies of Soloy Helicopters. Guides are not permitted to be under the influence of recreational drugs or alcohol while heli-ski guiding. Although there is not an employee handbook that specifically states how a breaking of this or any other rule will be handled, offences [sic] are not taken lightly and infractions of any rule, especially serious ones, will be dealt with individually and can result in termination. - A review of the pilot’s training records indicated that he completed recurrent training on January 21, 2021, including a pilot competency check and a line check, as required by 14 CFR 135.293 and 135.299, respectively. In addition, the pilot completed CFIT-A ground training in January 2021 and IIMC flight training in January 2020. Records showed that the IIMC flight training lasted 1 hour and covered “T/R [tail rotor] failures, autorotations, emergency ops.” The records did not indicate the specific IIMC training that the pilot received, and no other record was found showing IIMC flight training for the pilot. The IIMC flight training also included pinnacle landings and slopes and heli-ski and snow operations. - The helicopter was configured with the pilot’s seat in the front right seat position. Passenger seats were located in the front left seat position and a bench in the cabin with four seating positions. Figure 3 shows the helicopter seating configuration. The senior lead guide was in the left front seat; the other lead guide was in aft seat No. 1. The deceased passengers were in aft seat Nos. 2 and 4; the surviving passenger was in aft seat No. 3.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Simplified drawing of the accident helicopter showing seating positions with rear bench seat position numbers annotated.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nSurviving Passenger Account&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the surviving passenger, when the helicopter came to rest, he was still inside the helicopter with his body stuck in snow and lodged between two other occupants. He observed one of the other passengers (later identified as the occupant in aft seat No. 4) sitting in the snow outside the helicopter and heard thumping sounds from the bottom of the helicopter. The surviving passenger and the passenger who had been in aft seat No. 4 verbally communicated with each other using short messages. The surviving passenger noted that the passenger then began to move downslope in a seated position (the surviving passenger was unsure what that passenger was doing) and that he (the passenger who had been in aft seat No. 4) eventually stopped responding. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe surviving passenger recalled that he eventually saw the light of a helicopter, which appeared to have left the area before coming back and hovering over the accident site. The passenger did not recall anything else until he woke up in a hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital, the passenger had a recorded internal temperature of 82°F along with extensive frostbite damage to both hands.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight-Following and Search and Rescue Efforts&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA TML heli-ski guide (who was not aboard the accident helicopter) reported, during a postaccident interview, that he was “on radio communications and flight following” for the lodge on the day of the accident, and the TML radio/event log for that day showed that the flight-follower was in communication with a guide aboard the accident helicopter during the flight. The flight-follower stated that his “main source of communication” with the helicopter would be “via inReach, which is a Garmin satellite device.” The flight-follower also reported that the ski guide “was checking in every hour via inReach with a written message” and that inReach had an automated tracking system that sent a “ping” that the flight-follower tracked on his computer. The flight-follower further reported that he also used a flight-following website that depicted where the helicopter was operating.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe TML flight-follower’s last communication with the ski guide (acknowledging that an inReach interval was received) occurred about 1824. About 10 minutes later, the last flight-following ping from the helicopter was received. About 1915, TML’s flight-follower notified a TML supervisor that there had been “no positive comms” with the ski guide within the last 1.5 hours and that “flight following indicates no movement” of the helicopter in the last 40 minutes. The supervisor contacted another heli-ski operator in the area, Third Edge Heli, to find out the status of the accident helicopter (Third Edge Heli’s operation base was closer to the helicopter’s last known location than TML’s operations base). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a conversation between representatives from TML and Third Edge Heli, the Third Edge Heli representative considered the flight to be “ops normal” and expected that the last lift would occur about 1940. The TML supervisor then instructed the flight-follower to “keep an eye on” the accident helicopter. The TML radio/event log showed that the flight-follower continued attempting to reach the helicopter through 1949 with no success.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 2004, Third Edge Heli mistakenly reported to TML that the accident helicopter was “inbound” for the Wasilla Lake residence. About 2025, Third Edge Heli notified Soloy Helicopters that the helicopter was overdue. About 2030, TML notified Soloy that it was activating its emergency plan. About 2032, Soloy Helicopters activated its emergency response plan. About 2034, Third Edge Heli requested that one of its helicopters attempt to locate the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 2052, the Soloy Helicopters director of operations arrived at the company office and notified the Alaska Rescue Coordination Center (AKRCC) about the overdue helicopter. (The AKRCC, which logged this notification about 2110, was responsible for coordinating on-land and aviation federal search and rescue activities in Alaska.) About 2112, Third Edge Heli contacted the AKRCC about the overdue helicopter. About 2136, the wreckage was located by an Alpha Aviation Helicopter, which was under contract with Third Edge Heli. About 2202, Third Edge Heli called the AKRCC to relay that the wreckage was located on the “Knik [Glacier] side of the ridge.” The AKRCC responded that a helicopter would be en route to the coordinates where the wreckage was located. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhile the helicopter crew prepared to launch, AKRCC updated Soloy Helicopters, Third Edge Heli, and the Alaska State Troopers. About 2258, the AKRCC told the Alaska State Troopers that the crew was about to take off. About 2325, an Alaska Air National Guard (ANG) helicopter was on scene searching for the wreckage, which the crew located about 2333. According to the Alaska ANG helicopter pilot, it was a clear night, but the wind was at least 20 knots or more at the top of the mountains. It took about 30 minutes for the helicopter to dump the amount of fuel that would allow it to descend to a hover over the accident site and hoist down two pararescue personnel. They arrived at the wreckage site about 0015, about 5 hours 40 minutes after the accident and about 2 hours after TML and Soloy Helicopters activated their emergency response plans. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cause of death for the passengers in aft seats No. 2 and 4 was blunt force injuries. (The causes of death for the pilot and ski guides were discussed in the Medical and Pathological Information section of this report.) According to information from the first on-scene responders, the passenger who had been in aft seat No. 4 was ejected from the helicopter, and the other five occupants were found in the cabin wreckage. The surviving passenger was still wearing his seatbelt, which had to be cut before he could be extricated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 0115, the Alaska ANG helicopter pilot reported to the AKRCC that the helicopter was en route to a hospital in Anchorage with one passenger, who was in critical condition. The Alaska ANG helicopter arrived at the hospital about 0136.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring postaccident interviews, the Soloy Helicopters director of operations was asked what time the accident flight was due back to the principal operations base; he stated that he did not have that information but that TML was providing the flight-locating. The director of operations was then asked how Soloy was able to conduct flight-locating if the company did not know when the accident flight was due back. The director of operations responded that TML was responsible for determining if the helicopter was overdue. When the Soloy Helicopters’ director of operations was asked about the delay between being informed that the helicopter was overdue (about 2025) and notifying the AKRCC (about 2052), he stated that he was “still working through the information that was provided” about the helicopter. - Aerial assessment of the accident site on the day after the accident revealed that the helicopter impacted terrain about 15 to 20 ft below the top of the ridgeline. The main wreckage came to rest on its right side about 500 ft downslope from the initial impact area, as shown in figure 2. The debris field extended about 900 ft downslope from the top of the ridgeline. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Accident site (Source: Alaska State Troopers).&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ELT’s installed location (the upper right side of the right baggage compartment) was found packed with snow. The ELT remained secured to its airframe mount via a velcro strap. The ELT’s antenna coaxial cable and remote cockpit control wiring remained connected. The ELT switch was found in the ARM position. The external antenna had been fractured from its mount and was not located. Postaccident testing of the ELT found that it was working properly and that the ELT had transmitted during and after the accident sequence for 178 hours (12,884 bursts at 50-second intervals). -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot, the sole occupant, was making a personal cross-country flight in the helicopter. According to flight tracking data, the helicopter departed and proceeded on course for about 1 hour 33 minutes. The flight track ended when the helicopter was about 70 nautical miles (nm) from its destination, over open ocean water, at an altitude of 394 ft mean sea level, and at a groundspeed of 132 knots.  When the helicopter failed to arrive at its destination, family and friends contacted the Federal Aviation Administration and an extensive search was launched. During the search and rescue (SAR) operation, an inflated yellow pop-out float believed to be from the accident helicopter was located on the ocean surface. The search continued with additional SAR assets; however, minimal debris believed to be from the helicopter was observed in the water, and the search was suspended. Days after the accident, debris was discovered on the shore of an island about 42 nm north from the accident site and identified to be from the helicopter. Most of the helicopter was not located, and it is presumed to have sunk in the ocean waters. The pilot was not located, and an autopsy and toxicology test could not be performed. &#x0D;\nWeather satellite imagery indicated that as the helicopter approached the vicinity of the accident site, it was likely operating in visual meteorological conditions beneath scattered-to-broken cloud cover. A weather station near the accident site reported wind gusting to 27 knots, which could have led to low-level wind shear conditions. Investigators were unable to determine the cause of the accident with the available information&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "On March 2, 2021, about 1539 Alaska standard time, a Robinson Helicopter Company R66 helicopter, N1767, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident about 70 nautical miles north of Kodiak, Alaska. The pilot, the sole occupant, was not located. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot’s wife, her husband owned Kodiak Helicopters, LLC, which owned and operated the helicopter. She stated that he had requested the use of the helicopter from a company employee to make a trip to see family located in Kodiak. She added that they had just returned from an out-of-state trip, and after arriving in Anchorage, Alaska, her husband went directly to Merrill Field Airport (MRI), Anchorage, where the helicopter was located.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nA pilot for Kodiak Helicopters reported that he was contacted earlier in the day by the accident pilot, who told him that he needed the helicopter for the next few days. According to the Kodiak Helicopters pilot, he flew the helicopter from Palmer, Alaska, to MRI and then filled the helicopter with fuel. He added that he had brief contact with the accident pilot while unloading his personal gear from the helicopter and that the accident pilot seemed distracted and was “not himself.” Additionally, he said that the accident pilot mentioned that a local newspaper was set to publish a story about him within the next few hours, and he wanted to be with his family in Kodiak when the story broke. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAccording to the Kodiak Helicopters pilot, the helicopter departed from MRI at 1406 with a planned destination of Kodiak Airport (ADQ). The Kodiak Helicopters pilot said he viewed the helicopter’s en route progress via Spidertracks (a real-time tracking system), and at 1539, the helicopter’s Spidertracks data stopped in an area south of the Barren Islands over open ocean waters.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAbout 1630, the Kodiak Helicopters pilot and the pilot’s wife began making inquiries to see if the helicopter had arrived in Kodiak. They were unable to locate the helicopter and contacted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to initiate an organized search for the missing helicopter. An FAA Alert Notice (ALNOT) was issued, and an extensive search was launched. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nDuring the search and rescue (SAR) operation, the United States Coast Guard (USCG) dispatched a rescue helicopter that located an inflated yellow pop-out float believed to be from the accident helicopter (see figure 1). The USCG stated that an emergency locator transmitter beacon was not received from the accident helicopter. No distress calls from the helicopter were reported. The search continued with additional SAR assets; however, minimal debris believed to be from the helicopter was observed in the water, and the search was suspended on March 3, 2021, about 1130.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Inflated yellow pop-out float believed to be from the helicopter- (Photo courtesy of the USCG)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the archived Spidertracks data revealed that after departure, the helicopter flew south down the Kenai Peninsula and then out over the ocean on course for Kodiak. At 1539, the last data point was recorded as the helicopter passed between Ushagat Island and West Amatuli Islands (two of the Barren Islands), at an altitude of 394 ft mean sea level (msl), on a heading of 186°, and at a groundspeed of 132 knots (see figure 2).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n(&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Spidertracks Data from Accident Flight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of FAA data indicated that there were no preflight weather briefings or air traffic services provided to the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDays after the accident, pilots of an air charter company based in Kodiak discovered debris on a beach near Afognak Island, Alaska, which is located about 42 nm north of Kodiak. The debris was recovered and found to be part of the helicopter’s float, skid tube, and fuselage structure. No other wreckage was located.&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s logbook was not available for review, and recent information on the flight history of the pilot could not be determined. &#x0D;\nA review of the helicopter’s maintenance logbooks revealed no outstanding discrepancies or irregularities.&#x0D;\nReview of weather data indicated that an area of low cloud cover was located along most of the accident flight path on the western portion of the Kenai Peninsula. The observations from the Seldovia Airport (PASO), Seldovia, Alaska, about 37 nautical miles north-northeast of the accident site, surrounding the accident time indicated marginal visual flight rules (MVFR) to instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions prevailed. Weather satellite imagery indicated that as the helicopter approached the Barren Islands, there was scattered to broken cloud cover. &#x0D;\nA marine station located on East Amatuli Island, about 6 miles east-northeast of the accident site reported a northwest wind gusting to 27 knots at the time of the accident. At the time the helicopter passed near Nanwalek, Alaska, about 30 nautical miles north from the accident site, between 1523 to 1526, the south-facing FAA Aviation Weather Camera indicated cloud bases near or below 850 ft msl, while the southwest-facing FAA Aviation Weather Camera indicated cloud bases near but above 650 ft msl. Visibility below the cloud base was above 3 statute miles based on the south-facing camera imagery. &#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "During a short sightseeing flight around an island, the helicopter lost total engine power and descended into heavily wooded, steep terrain. The majority of the helicopter was consumed by a postcrash fire. The helicopter’s proximity to the rising terrain at the time of the power loss likely precluded the pilot from performing a successful autorotation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine found evidence of fatigue fractures on two of the stage 3 compressor blades and fatigue fractures on the majority of the stage 6 compressor blades. Analysis of the remainder of the stages 3 and 6 compressor wheels showed that they met material requirements. Thermal damage to the compressor case halves precluded determining whether the stages 3 and 6 blades were rubbing against the case and its plastic coating, which could have initiated the fatigue fractures. While pitting corrosion could also result in fatigue fractures, no evidence of pitting corrosion was found and only surface corrosion was present. The liberation of the two stage 3 compressor blades led to their ingestion within the remaining compressor stages, resulting in the total loss of engine power in flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine maintenance manual contained provisions for more frequent inspections when the engine is operating in an erosive and/or corrosive environment, such as where the accident operator was located. A caution within the 300-hour inspection table stated that the inspection must not exceed 300 hours or 12 months for coated compressor wheels, including the accident engine’s stage 2-3 compressor wheel. The engine logbook showed that a 300-hour engine inspection was completed about 3 years and 800 flight hours before the accident. Paperwork associated with the two most recent inspections, conducted by the accident operator about 11 months and 1 month before the accident, respectively, did not indicate that the 300-hour inspection had been performed. Had maintenance personnel completed the 300-hour inspection of the compressor case halves, blades, and vanes within the recommended 12-month interval, the presence of corrosion or damage to the plastic coating could have been detected and addressed.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 15, 2021, about 1514 Atlantic standard time, a Bell 206B-III, N13AT, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The pilot and three passengers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 sightseeing flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Director of Operations, the accident flight was a planned 17-minute sightseeing flight around the island. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness standing in his front yard saw the helicopter fly over his house and out over the ocean. He stated that the helicopter began to make a 180° turn back toward him, at which time he began recording a video of the helicopter. About 6 seconds after the start of the video, a puff of dark-colored smoke emanated from the vicinity of the engine compartment and dissipated in the helicopter’s rotor wash. The helicopter then abruptly yawed nose-left, then yawed nose-right, and descended in a right turn over wooded terrain downhill from the witness. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located in heavily wooded, steep terrain and the wreckage came to rest upright oriented on a heading of about 200° magnetic. The landing skids, main rotor system, main rotor drive system, engine, hydraulic system, and the forward portion of the tail rotor drive system were thermally damaged by a postimpact fire. The majority of the cockpit, cabin, and flight controls were consumed by fire. A portion of the tailboom, with the horizontal stabilizers attached, was embedded upright in a tree adjacent to the main wreckage. The aft portion of the tailboom, with the vertical fin and tail rotor, was found about 15 feet from the tailboom section. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine case showed no evidence of uncontained failure. The 1st and 2nd stage compressor blades displayed no evidence of foreign object debris ingestion. Two blades from the third stage compressor wheel had fractured near their respective root ends and were not present. The remainder of the 3rd stage compressor blades were present, but exhibited damage, primarily on their trailing edges. The 4th, 5th, and 6th stage compressor wheel blades were all fractured near their root ends and were not present. The impeller inducer exhibited evidence of hard body debris ingestion.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe compressor section, power turbine shaft, and compressor turbine shaft were examined by the materials engineering department at the engine manufacturer’s facility. The compressor vanes between stages 1 and 2 and stages 2 and 3 were present. A portion of the compressor vanes between stages 3 and 4 were missing, while the ones present were bent in the direction of normal compressor rotation. None of the remaining compressor vanes downstream of stage 4 were present. The stage 1 compressor wheel did not exhibit anomalous damage and its blades did not exhibit leading edge damage. Material analysis of the stage 1 compressor wheel showed that it met the required material type per the component drawing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth fractured stage 3 compressor blades exhibited signatures consistent with fatigue. Both fractures originated near the pressure side of their trailing edge, but the area of fatigue origins were impact damaged, precluding further analysis of the fatigue origins. There was no evidence of pitting corrosion on the remaining blades. On one blade, the fatigue progressed about 0.31 inches toward the leading edge, with the remainder of the fracture surface exhibiting signatures of overload. On the second blade, the fatigue fracture progressed about 0.023 inches toward the leading edge with the remainder of the fracture surface exhibiting signatures of overload. Analysis of a cross-section of the stage 2-3 compressor wheel found it met material requirements, including chemistry for material type as well as hardness. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGeneralized corrosion was present on the inner and outer diameters of the compressor wheels for stages 4 and 5, but no pitting corrosion was present on the remnant airfoils and rim. On the stages 4 and 5 compressor wheels, the majority of the fracture surfaces were smeared, but the portions that were not smeared exhibited signatures consistent with overload. Material analysis of the stages 4 and 5 compressor wheels showed they met the required material type per the component drawing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe stage 6 compressor inner and outer diameter surfaces exhibited generalized corrosion. On every stage 6 compressor blade, except for one, all fracture surfaces exhibited signatures of fatigue with multiple origins near the suction-side crown root. For the one blade, a crack was present on the surface that, when opened by the lab, revealed evidence of fatigue progression from multiple origins. Material analysis of the stage 6 compressor wheel showed it met material requirements, including chemistry for material type as well as hardness.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the engine logbook, the accident engine, serial number (S/N) CAE-833459, was installed new onto the accident airframe, S/N 3267, on February 6, 1981, at the time of manufacture. The accident helicopter had previously operated in Alaska and Texas with other operators before its arrival to Saint Thomas on November 26, 2019, for operation at Caribbean Buzz Helicopters. Between December 2008 to January 2009, at an engine total time (ETT) of 8,487.6 hours, compressor section S/N CAC-36783 was removed from the engine for overhaul and inspection. During this overhaul, a new stage 1 compressor wheel, stage 2-3 compressor wheel, and impeller were installed; the original stage 4 and stage 5 compressor wheels remained installed. At the conclusion of this overhaul, compressor section S/N CAC-36783 had a component time since new (CTSN) of 8,398.1 hours, a component time since overhaul (CTSO) of 0 hours, and a component cycles since new (CSN) of 8,892 cycles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe most recent engine maintenance occurred on February 12, 2021, at an airframe total time (ATT) of 11,516.9 hours and an ETT of 11,516.9 hours, during which the power turbine governor was replaced with an overhauled governor. At the start of the day of the accident, the helicopter had an ATT of 11,519.3 hours and an ETT of 11,519.3 hours; compressor section S/N CAC-36783 had a CTSN of 11,429.8 hours, a CTSO of 3,031.7 hours, and a CSN of 12,607 cycles. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the helicopter’s time at Caribbean Buzz Helicopters, two annual/100-hour inspections were completed on the airframe and engine. The first annual inspection occurred on March 1, 2020, at an ATT of 11,406.2 hours and an ETT of 11,406.2 hours. The second and most recent annual inspection was performed on January 25, 2021, at an ATT of 11,504.2 hours and an ETT of 11,504.2 hours. The 100-hour engine inspection included a visual inspection for the compressor inlet guide vanes and visible blades and vanes for foreign object damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 300-hour inspection checklist required inspection of the case, blades, and vanes when operating in an erosive and/or corrosive environment. The inspection recommended using 10X power magnification to inspect for corrosion pits. The 300-hour engine inspection included a caution that stated the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRolls-Royce Commercial Service Letter (CSL) 1172 discusses compressor case inspection intervals that may change based on operating environments. CSL 1172 was originally issued on February 28, 1991, with Revision 4, the latest revision, dated December 21, 2007. CSL 1172 states that for non-coated compressor wheels, the case-half inspection interval shall not exceed 300 hours or 6 months, whichever occurs first. For coated compressor wheels and blisk compressor wheels, the inspection shall not exceed 300 hours or 12 months, whichever occurs first. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine logbook indicated that a 300-hour engine inspection was completed on February 16, 2017, at an ATT of 10,959.5 hours and an ETT of 10,959.5 hours. Another 300-hour inspection checklist was endorsed on January 11, 2018, at an ATT of 11,197.2 hours and an ETT of 11,197.2 hours, but a corresponding 300-hour inspection entry could not be found in either aircraft or engine logbooks. An undated engine inspection checklist from Caribbean Buzz Helicopters, endorsed on March 1, 2020, had no initials or markings in the 300-hour inspection section. During the last annual/100-hour inspection, endorsed on January 25, 2021, the engine inspection checklist’s 300-hour inspection section was crossed out and marked “N/A.” According to the operator’s director of maintenance, the compressor case halves were not opened to facilitate visual inspection of the compressor section. Instead, only borescope was used to inspect the compressor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRolls-Royce CSL 1135, discusses engine contamination removal instructions using water, also known as a water rinse. CSL 1135 states that “engines subjected to saltwater contamination shall undergo water rinsing after shutdown following the last flight of the day” and provides instructions to spray water into the compressor inlet while the engine is being motored with the starter. A review of the aircraft logbook found multiple entries regarding an engine compressor rinse, with the most recent entry of an engine rinse occurring on January 13, 2021, at an ATT of 11,497.0 hours and an ETT of 11,497.0 hours. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot departed for the first flight of the day to begin aerial tree trimming operations along a transmission line. The mission’s ground support specialist (GSS), who was in communication with the pilot via radio, observed the helicopter approach the trimming zone from the south then fly northbound to the east of the transmission line; the helicopter was equipped with an external saw assembly that was about 120 ft in length and about 40 to 50 ft above the trees. The GSS and the pilot discussed hazards located in the trimming zone. Shortly thereafter, the pilot announced over the radio that he would be making an emergency landing. The GSS reported that he did not see any smoke or hear “odd noises” coming from the helicopter and that “the helicopter made a quick forward descent until the saw disappeared into the east tree line.” The helicopter subsequently impacted trees and terrain, and a postimpact fire ensued.&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation, but the examination was limited due to the thermal damage to the helicopter. Annunciator light bulb filament analysis revealed that the main rotor transmission oil pressure light was likely illuminated at the time of the accident, and the emergency procedure is to land as soon as possible. &#x0D;\nThe pilot was likely performing an emergency landing due to the illumination of the transmission oil pressure warning light. The reason that the pilot did not release the external saw from the helicopter during the attempted emergency landing could not be determined based on the available evidence. &#x0D;\nThe reason that the warning light likely illuminated could also not be determined. Operator text communications showed that, about 2 weeks before the accident, another company pilot reported an issue with the accident helicopter, to which a mechanic responded, “trans oil pressure may be the cause.” However, the operator stated that the main rotor transmission oil pressure light could illuminate when ferrying the external saw at higher speeds due to the aerodynamic drag placed on the external saw in forward flight and the nose-low attitude required to pull the saw during flight. The operator also stated that slowing the airspeed or adjusting the helicopter into trim would extinguish the light and allow for normal operation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "A review of the airframe maintenance records revealed that, on December 20, 2020, a 100&#x1E;hour helicopter inspection was completed, which included the removal of the over&#x1E;running clutch and the installation of a serviceable over-running clutch. On December 21, 2020, a 300-hour airframe inspection was also completed with a total airframe time of 12,807.2 hours. The engine records revealed that 150/300/600-hour inspections were completed on December 17, 2020, with a total engine time of 3,332.3 hours, and 3,468 cycles. On December 7, 2020, the fuel control unit was replaced “due to erratic engine operation during start up sequence.”&#x0D;\nAccording to company text communications regarding helicopter maintenance and flight operations information, on December 13, 2020, a pilot reported that “had the ‘warning’ tone annunciate 3 [times] in the last flight. Had no secondary indications. Early in the flight so I don’t think it was the low fuel light blinking.” A company mechanic responded, “Trans oil pressure may be the cause on [N103SU], a quick flicker will cause tone.” A company employee replied that another helicopter in the company’s fleet “does it all the time on windy days with the warning audio going off and no secondary indication. If you’re not low on fuel then it’s likely the trans pressure [gauge].” This company employee also stated that he had “caught it faintly illuminating the panel light with a good gust pushing things way out of trim for a second.” The pilot then responded that he “was figuring one or the 2” and that he “tried inducing a trans press light but couldn’t get it to do it.” The pilot further stated that he would “keep an eye on it.” No additional related communications were provided through December 23, 2020, when the text conversation ended. &#x0D;\nAccording to the rotorcraft flight manual emergency and malfunction procedures, if the main rotor transmission oil pressure indicator (red warning light) illuminates, the procedure is to land as soon as possible. The main transmission oil pressure warning does not produce an audible tone; audible and visual warnings are only provided for engine-out and low-rotor conditions.&#x0D;\nA review of the accident helicopter’s instrument panel showed a warning tone switch below the annunciator panel lights in the center of the upper instrument panel (see figure 2.). The maintenance records did not indicate an installed separate warning tone system for the helicopter.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nFigure 2. Instrument panel with warning tone switch (Source: MD Helicopters).&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, previous flight experience showed that the main rotor transmission oil pressure light can illuminate when ferrying the external saw at higher speeds or turbulent conditions due to the aerodynamic drag placed on the external saw in forward flight and the nose-low attitude required to pull the external saw during flight. The operator also stated that slowing the airspeed or adjusting the helicopter into trim would extinguish the light and allow for normal operation. The operator added that “the nose-low attitude is not seen during normal flight profiles without the external load’s drag.” - On December 29, 2020, about 0835 central standard time, a Hughes 369D helicopter, N103SU, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Tuckers Crossing, Mississippi. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 133 external load flight.&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the pilot departed for the first flight of the day from a private landing zone to begin aerial tree trimming operations along a transmission line, which was about 2.7 miles from the departure location. The helicopter contained about 400 pounds of fuel and was equipped with an external saw assembly that was about 120 ft in length. The mission’s ground support specialist (GSS), who was in communication with the pilot via radio, stated that the helicopter approached the trimming zone from the south and flew northbound to the east of the transmission line. He estimated that the external saw was about 40 to 50 ft above the trees. The GSS and the pilot discussed hazards located in the trimming zone. Shortly thereafter, the pilot announced over the radio that he would be making an emergency landing. The GSS reported he did not see any smoke or hear any “odd noises” coming from the helicopter and that “the helicopter made a quick forward descent until the saw disappeared into the east tree line.” The helicopter subsequently impacted trees and terrain, and a postimpact fire ensued.&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located in wooded terrain to the east of the transmission line (see figure 1). The external saw assembly was found connected to the helicopter’s trapeze assembly and entangled in the trees. &#x0D;\n Figure 1. Main wreckage (Source: Federal Aviation Administration). - On August 11, 2017, the pilot successfully completed the “MD520N Pilot Transition Training” course provided by MD Helicopters. &#x0D;\nThe operator provided the pilot’s two resumes, which were not dated. On one resume, the pilot reported 785 hours of flight experience with external load/long-line operations; on the other resume, the pilot reported 1,100 hours. The operator hired the pilot in April 2019, and he completed the 14 CFR 133.37 knowledge and skills tests on May 11, 2019. &#x0D;\nBetween June 2019 and March 2020, the pilot completed 126 flights and accumulated 119.4 total flight hours, of which 117.1 hours were for external load operations. The available information for this accident did not show the pilot’s total flight experience with the operator. - The main wreckage, which consisted of the fuselage, engine, main transmission, and rotor assembly, was consumed by the postimpact fire. The tail rotor assembly had separated from the tailboom near the tail rotor gearbox and was found adjacent to the main wreckage. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter found that the airframe fuselage, cockpit structure, and helicopter instruments and avionics exhibited extensive thermal damage. The tailboom had separated from the aft fuselage boom fairing tail cone. Damage consistent with three main rotor blade strikes was observed on the tailboom. The cargo hook system, which consisted of a primary (electrical) and secondary (hydraulic) release system, was intact, and no anomalies were noted with the system. The cargo hook remained attached to the external saw.&#x0D;\nDue to thermal damage, flight control continuity could not be established to the cyclic, collective, and anti-torque controls. A damaged section of the anti-torque control tube located in the aft tailboom section moved appropriately when the tail rotor blades were manipulated by hand.&#x0D;\nThe overrunning clutch and main transmission driveshaft exhibited extensive thermal damage. The coupling between the overrunning clutch and main transmission driveshaft was partially separated. The main rotor transmission was thermally damaged except for some internal gears. The main rotor driveshaft was observed inside the static mast. The lower end of the main rotor driveshaft remained splined to the output gear of the main transmission and the upper end was bolted to the main rotor hub. Thermal damage was observed on the static mast and visible portions of the main rotor driveshaft.&#x0D;\nThe main rotor system exhibited extensive thermal damage. The main rotor hub, including the main rotor blades and pitch housing, remained attached to the main rotor driveshaft. The five main rotor blades exhibited varying degrees of deformation, which included warping, bending, trailing-edge separation, chordwise scratching, and thermal damage. Four main rotor blade pitch links remained attached and intact; one was bent and fractured about midspan. Three main rotor blade pitch horns were intact; two were fractured. The main rotor hub rotated when the main rotor driveshaft was rotated by hand using the main transmission output gear.&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor driveshaft was fractured into several segments. One segment exhibited damage consistent with a main rotor blade strike. The tail rotor transmission rotated when the tail rotor assembly was rotated by hand; no unusual sounds were heard during rotation. The tail rotor transmission chip detector was removed and found to be free of visible particulate matter.&#x0D;\nNo fuel system components were identified in the wreckage due to the postimpact fire.&#x0D;\nThe engine exhibited extensive thermal damage. The engine was disassembled, and seven airfoils, comprising a single packet of third-stage turbine wheel airfoils between the shroud slots, were fractured in overload near the shroud. No evidence indicated progressive fracture on any of the third-stage turbine blades. The intact portion of the shroud on the third&#x1E;stage turbine wheel exhibited asymmetric rub damage, with the most severe rub damage located about 90° in the direction of engine rotation from the center of the packet of missing airfoils. The first- and second&#x1E;stage turbine airfoils exhibited tip rub. All other damage was consistent with impact or thermal damage. &#x0D;\nExamination of the available airframe and engine components revealed no anomalies that would have precluded operation.&#x0D;\nThe cockpit warning and caution indicators, which were located at the top of the instrument panel, were submitted to the National Transportation Safety Board’s Materials Laboratory for examination. The individual annunciators, each of which had four bulbs, were removed and x&#x1E;rayed to determine the status of the bulb filaments. The XMSN (transmission) OIL PRESSURE annunciator exhibited hot filament stretching, consistent with the warning light being illuminated at the time of the impact. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and passenger departed on a flight to herd cattle via helicopter. There were no witnesses to the accident. Examination of the wreckage and debris pattern was consistent with an inflight break-up at low altitude. Main rotor blade contact marks were found on the cabin section of the fuselage and likely occurred before ground impact. No preimpact anomalies were found with helicopter or engine.&#x0D;\nToxicology of the pilot identified high levels of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the active compound in cannabis), as well as its active and inactive metabolites. Even accounting for postmortem redistribution, the levels of THC detected indicated recent use of cannabis and a very high likelihood of impairment. Given that gastric and liver levels were very high while lung levels were much lower, it is likely that the pilot used an edible form of the drug. &#x0D;\nBased on the available information, it is likely that the pilot lost control and exceeded the performance and/or structural limitations of the helicopter while flying at low-level, resulting in an inflight breakup. It is likely that the pilot’s impairment from his recent use of cannabis contributed to the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter’s maintenance history could not be determined, as no logbooks were available for review. - On December 10, 2020, about 0930 central standard time, a Robinson R44 helicopter, N7085Z, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Colorado City, Texas. The pilot and passenger sustained fatal injuries. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.&#x0D;\nAccording to a family member, the intent of the flight was to herd cattle on a ranch. The flight originated from the pilot’s home helicopter pad about 0900. There were no reported radio or distress calls from the pilot, and there were no witnesses. Visual flight rules conditions prevailed in the area around the time of the accident.&#x0D;\nThere were no witnesses to the accident, which was reported to local authorities about 1400. - The pilot’s certificate was revoked in 2011 for flying while intoxicated. It was reinstated in 2014. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the autopsy performed by the Southwestern Institute of Forensic Sciences at Dallas, the cause of death was blunt force injuries, and the manner of death was accident. No significant natural disease was identified.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the Laboratory at the Southwestern Institute of Forensic Sciences at Dallas identified delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis) at 132 ng/ml and its inactive metabolite, carboxy-delta-9-THC at 329.5 ng/ml in chest cavity blood. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA’s Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified delta-9-THC at 81.7 ng/ml in cavity blood as well as at 2,664.5 ng/ml in gastric contents, 29.5 ng/g in liver tissue, 914.4 ng/g in lung, and 94.8 ng/g in brain. In addition, its psychoactive metabolite, 11-hydroxy-delta-9-THC, was identified at 96 ng/ml in cavity blood,171.1 ng/g in liver tissue, 46.7 ng/g in lung, and 44.1 in brain. Finally, the inactive metabolite, carboxy-delta-9-THC was found at 356.6 ng/ml in cavity blood, 3749.5 ng/g in liver, 190.9 ng/g in lung, and 94 ng/g in the brain. - The pilot’s logbooks were not available for review. Estimates of his flight time were provided by a family member. - The wreckage was located on relatively flat rural terrain, and the debris field was about 400 yards long. The first pieces of wreckage were identified as fragments of the left landing skid and forward skid strut. About 30 yards forward of the strut, fragments of a main rotor blade skin were found. The main wreckage, consisting of the cabin, main rotor assembly, and tail boom and rotor assembly were found about 400 yards from the left landing gear skid and strut fragments. There was no evidence of an in-flight collision with fixed obstacles. &#x0D;\nThe wreckage debris pattern was consistent with an inflight break-up at low altitude. A tail rotor driveshaft segment was found twisted and fractured forward of the aft flex coupling. The fracture and twist were consistent with a sudden stoppage. The tail rotor gearbox rotated by hand more than 360° with no anomalies. The tail rotor blades exhibited minor dents on the outer skins, with no damage to the leading edges. The tail rotor pitch control operated properly. The main rotor blades exhibited impact damage near mid-span and damage to the leading edge of the spars, which separated sections of skin and honeycomb.&#x0D;\nThe nose of the cabin showed impact damage consistent with main rotor blade contact before ground impact. Paint transfer marks on the damaged portions of the main rotor blades and the left side of the landing gear strut were consistent with the shape of a main rotor blade spar. There was paint transfer in the damaged areas of both main rotor blades. The main and tail rotor flight controls displayed several fractures. The surfaces of the fractures were angular and jagged, consistent with overload. The tail rotor pedals were found jammed with the left pedal forward. &#x0D;\nOther than impact damages and separations, flight control continuity was established from the cockpit throughout all flight controls to the main rotor head and tail rotor assembly.&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blade fragments were examined and there was no evidence of pre-impact delamination. All main rotor blade damage was consistent with impact forces. The tail rotor blade damage was consistent with impact forces.&#x0D;\nNo pre-impact anomalies were found with the engine. Rotational continuity was established from the engine to the main and tail rotor gearboxes. Rotational signatures were present on the engine crankshaft. &#x0D;\nNo pre-impact structural anomalies were found. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On September 19, 2020, about 1356 central daylight time, a Safari 400 helicopter, N60WD, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Red Bud, Illinois.  The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness was across the street mowing grass at the time of the accident when she saw the helicopter depart normally toward the east. About 15 minutes later, the helicopter approached from the south behind a funeral home located on the south side of the street, and hover-taxied along an area between a bank and a storage building where the helicopter was based.  The witness looked toward the storage building and the “tail of the helicopter” appeared to contact the building. The helicopter subsequently came to rest on its left side adjacent to the building and a postimpact fire ensued.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA second witness observed the helicopter hovering about 6 to 8 ft above the ground when it began “spinning out of control.” It started going “up and down” and finally “came straight down,” and collided with the storage building.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSurveillance video footage from the bank depicted the helicopter hovering near a storage building shortly before the accident. The camera was motion-activated and there were significant time gaps in the footage. According to the time stamp on the video, between 1334:28 and 1334:35, the pilot hover taxied southbound between the bank and the storage building. Between 1355:59 and 1356:08, the pilot hover taxied northbound between the bank and the storage building. Upon reaching the north end of the building, the pilot turned right (toward the east). The video footage stopped even though the helicopter remained in the field of view. The footage picked up again at 1356:39 and depicted a fire adjacent to the storage building. The accident sequence itself was not captured. The helicopter appeared to be under control and operating normally during the time the camera was recording.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on its left side against the storage building oriented toward the west. The forward portion of the helicopter was destroyed by the postimpact fire. Postaccident airframe and engine examinations did not reveal any anomalies; however, the airframe examination was hindered by the extent of the postimpact fire damage.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot had been conducting fire suppression activities for the United States Forest Service using a water bucket suspended at the end of a 140-ft longline. The pilot informed the controller that he would need to return to the base for fuel after another bucket of water, which was the last communication between the controller and the pilot. The helicopter was subsequently located in a river at the dip site. No mayday call was received. &#x0D;\nOnboard global position system (GPS) data revealed that the helicopter had arrived at the dip site and was hovering at an altitude of 138 ft above the water, which would place the helicopter about 40 ft above the treetops. The water bucket would have been near or in the water. No evidence showed any signs of rotor system contact with the trees. However, evidence did show that the helicopter rolled to the left as it descended and the 140-ft longline wrapped around the fuselage during the descent. The helicopter then struck the river in an inverted position and continued to roll to the left until it came to rest on its right side. The lack of damage to the longline demonstrated that both rotor systems and pylons had separated from the fuselage while the helicopter was in flight. The left rotor blades were found 560 ft away from the main wreckage.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination revealed that the damage observed on the right rotor blades, right hub, and right pylon occurred after they were struck by the left rotor blades while the helicopter was above the dip site. The damage observed on the left rotor system occurred when it hit the right rotor system while in flight. This intermeshing contact resulted in the in-flight separation and breakup of the left rotor blades.&#x0D;\nThe failure of the left white blade servo flap started as a fracture of the lower skin at the spar-to-afterbody transition and peel separation of the upper skin before transitioning to fracture of both upper and lower skins at the transition. The transition between separation modes, onset of reverse bending damage at the outboard closeout, and the extent of damage to the left white blade servo flap compared to the servo flaps from the remaining three blades indicates that the left white blade servo flap was cracked at its inboard end prior to the collision between the left and right rotor systems. The inboard end crack grew progressively and compromised the structural integrity of the servo flap leading to the failure and eventual separation of the afterbody. &#x0D;\nFailure of the left white blade servo flap resulted in a loss of control of the left white blade. However, it could not be determined why the left white blade servo flap failure ultimately resulted in a collision between the left and right rotor systems in this accident. A past event involving a servo flap separation demonstrated that the loss of a servo flap does not always result in catastrophic consequences. It is likely that flight control inputs, including the pilot’s responses to an abnormal vibration in the rotor system, were a factor to the catastrophic outcome of the servo flap failure in this accident. The lack of flight data precluded analysis of the control inputs leading up to the collision between the left and right rotor systems.",
    "FactualNarrative": "In April 2009, Kaman received a report that the accident helicopter (at the time registered as N361KA) experienced an inflight separation of a left white blade servo flap. The entirety of the servo flap had separated from its attachment brackets. The pilot was able to land the helicopter with no additional damage to the airframe.  &#x0D;\nOn June 16, 2010, in Donnelley, Idaho, a K-1200 helicopter was involved in an accident. The investigation found the afterbody of a servo flap had completely separated. The NTSB determined the probable cause was the collision of two counter-rotating main rotor blades for undetermined reasons, which resulted in a loss of control. For more information, see case number WPR10FA295 at the NTSB’s website.  &#x0D;\nThe manufacturer conducted a demonstration on a whirl stand to show the effects of a rotor system with one of the two blades’ servo flap having its inboard closeout removed. For this demonstration, an exemplar blade set was placed on a whirl stand and the inboard closeout was removed from the red blade servo flap. The blade set was operated at varying rotor speeds from 130 rpm to the maximum 270 rpm. Power was applied up to a maximum torque of 150%. According to the manufacturer, the demonstration yielded no signs of flutter or out-of-track conditions, and the flight control loads were not out of any limits. The blades (servo flaps) showed no signs of cracking in the bond lines, especially around the flap horn. - The K-1200 helicopter had two counterrotating, side-by-side, intermeshing rotors with two blades per rotor (for a total of four blades). The rotors were out of phase by 90° and were tilted outward to allow each blade to clear its opposing rotor hub. The two rotor systems were mounted to, and driven by, a common transmission. When viewed from above, the left rotor system turned counterclockwise, and the right rotor system turned clockwise. The two blades for each rotor system comprised a matched set that was balanced at the helicopter manufacturer’s factory; each set had an “A” blade (colored white at the tip) and a “B” blade (colored red at the tip). Figure 2 shows the accident helicopter. The helicopter was not equipped with, or required to be equipped with, a flight data recorder.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Accident helicopter (Source: Central Copters).&#x0D;\nThe K-1200 rotor system used servo-flaps to control rotor blade pitch changes. The Kaman K-1200 Maintenance and Servicing Instructions document states the following about servo flaps: &#x0D;\nA servo-flap is mounted on each blade near the 3/4 radius and is controlled by [control] rods which transfer conventional cockpit flight control inputs through the azimuth assemblies to each servo flap. The servo-flap controls the pitch of the rotor blade and acts as an aerodynamic stabilizer. Because the servo-flap uses energy drawn from the air stream to twist the blade, control forces need only be high enough to deflect the small servo-flap.&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter was maintained under the manufacturer’s approved airworthiness inspection program. Recurring inspections for the rotor blade servo flaps in the K-12 maintenance manual included the preflight inspection and the 100 hour/annual or zone one progressive inspection. A review of the maintenance logbooks revealed that the last zone one inspection occurred on February 25, 2020. - On August 24, 2020, about 1747 Pacific daylight time, a Kaman K-1200 helicopter, N314, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Pine Grove, Oregon. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 external load flight. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was operated under an exclusive-use contract with the United States Forest Service (USFS) and had been conducting water bucket/fire suppression activities for the White River fire at Mt. Hood National Forest, Oregon. The air attack controller, who was in radio contact with the pilot, reported that the pilot indicated that he needed to return to the heliport to refuel after “one more bucket.” The pilot provided no further transmissions to the air attack controller. About 15 minutes later, the air attack controller contacted dispatch and learned that the helicopter had not returned to the heliport. The air attack controller then flew to the dip site, where he observed the helicopter lying on its right side in the river at the dip site. No “mayday” radio call was received from the accident pilot.&#x0D;\nOnboard GPS instrumentation revealed that, about 1745 on the day of the accident, the helicopter was about 0.75 miles southwest of the accident dip site. The helicopter returned to the dip site and began to slow down and descend over the dip site. The last recorded data point was about 138 ft above ground level at 0 knots and was about 15 ft from the location of the main wreckage; see figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Flightpath showing the helicopter’s height above ground level and speed. &#x0D;\nNote: The spacing between each vertical line represents a 1-second interval. - According to a family member, the pilot had about 10 years of flight experience in the helicopter make and model, and he performed the “more difficult operations” for the operator. - The dip site, where the helicopter came to rest, was lined on three sides by trees with a height of about 100 ft. No evidence indicated an in-flight impact with any of the trees surrounding the accident site.&#x0D;\nThe entire airframe was found at the accident site, and no evidence indicated an in-flight fuselage breakup. The nose of the helicopter had crushed aft and inward, which was consistent with contacting the river in an inverted attitude. The tailboom exhibited deformation on its underside immediately aft of the horizontal stabilizer, resulting in downward bending of the aft portion of the tailboom. The left horizontal stabilizer remained installed. The right horizontal stabilizer had fractured and separated but was found next to its normally installed location. The main and nose landing gears remained attached to the fuselage. The vertical fin remained attached to the tailboom, but its top end was impact damaged.  &#x0D;\nThe 140-ft-long line, which remained attached to the cargo hook of the helicopter, had wrapped around the fuselage in a direction consistent with the fuselage rolling to the left around the long line (or, conversely, the long line wrapping above and to the right of the fuselage). The water bucket remained attached to the end of the long line and was found about 40 ft upstream of the accident site. The long line was not damaged, and the water bucket sustained minor damage.&#x0D;\nThe engine and transmission remained attached in the helicopter. Both left and right transmission pylons had separated from the main transmission center housing and were found adjacent to the main transmission. Examination of the engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\nExamination of the rotor blades found damage that included (but was not limited to) root end fractures on the left main rotors and contact marks on the left and right rotors. All blade dampers separated from their respective rotor systems; one was recovered. Both the left and right blade sets exhibited damage consistent with the blades leading and lagging beyond the stops.&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was established for the cyclic, collective, and pedal controls. The control tubes and bellcranks from the cockpit controls to the azimuth control installation exhibited impact fractures but no evidence of disconnection. The left and right azimuth controls remained attached to the lower side of the main transmission.&#x0D;\nLeft Rotor System&#x0D;\nThe white rotor blade fractured into three sections and separated from the hub near the root ends. The largest section of the white blade was found in a wooded area about 560 ft from the main wreckage. The tip section was located near the largest blade section and exhibited significant deformation in multiple locations. The inboard section of the white blade remained attached to its rotor head grip. &#x0D;\nThe white blade’s servo flap spar remained attached to the blade, but the servo-flap afterbody had completely fractured and separated from the spar and was found about 192 ft from the main wreckage. Both the upper and lower fractures of the servo-flap afterbody were nearly straight in the spanwise direction. &#x0D;\nThe red blade fractured into two locations. Most of the red blade was found in a wooded area about 500 ft from the main wreckage. The tip section was found in the wooded area about 570 ft from the main wreckage. The underside of the blade exhibited a dark-colored triangular-shaped rub mark, similar in color to the leading-edge coating of the rotor blades, as well as impact marks on the spar, core, and skin, consistent with a scuff and blunt impact marks along the leading edge of the right white blade. The inboard section of the left red blade remained attached to its rotor head grip. The red blade servo flap was whole and remained attached to the blade.&#x0D;\nRight Rotor System &#x0D;\nThe right white blade remained attached to the rotor head but fractured and partially separated in four locations. Most of the right white blade was found adjacent to the main wreckage. The right white servo flap was whole and remained attached to the blade.&#x0D;\nThe right red rotor blade fractured in one location, with most of the blade found about 81 ft from the main wreckage. The inboard section remained attached to its rotor head grip. &#x0D;\nThe right red servo flap was whole and remained attached to the blade. Damage was observed at the outboard end of the right red servo flap. The outboard closeout had cracked along the upper and lower bond lines. The cracks started near the mid-afterbody I-beam and extended forward and aft. The lower afterbody skin was cracked in the spanwise direction at the outboard end. One crack coincided with the trailing side of the spar, and the other crack coincided with the forward end of the trailing edge.&#x0D;\nServo Flap Examination  &#x0D;\nThe four servo flaps were further examined at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Materials Laboratory. &#x0D;\nThe separation of the left white servo flap afterbody occurred generally at the spar-to-afterbody transition along the spanwise direction with some regions of peel separation, as shown in figure 3. The separation started in the lower skin at the inboard end of the flap at the spar-to-afterbody transition. The fracture progressed outboard staying at or near the transition and the channel ply exhibited peel separation from the spar along the entire spanwise length. Electron microscope examination of the ply fibers revealed fiber contact damage, tensile fractures, and buckle fractures, consistent with alternating stresses. Along the upper surface, the separation also started at the inboard end of the flap and progressed outboard. The skin plies initially peeled from the spar, before transitioning to fracturing at or near the spar-to-afterbody transition, similar to the lower skin. Electron microscope examination of upper skin ply fibers in this region showed similar features as those observed for the lower skin. The channel ply also exhibited peel separation from the upper edge of the spar up to approximately 23 inches from the inboard end.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Separated servo-flap assembly from the left rotor/white main rotor blade showing the flap upper side (labeled a) and the flap lower side (labeled b). &#x0D;\nThe left white servo-flap closeouts were located at the inboard and outboard ends of the afterbody (see figure 4). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. Separated servo flap as viewed from the inboard end looking outboard (labeled a) and the outboard end looking inboard (labeled b). &#x0D;\nBoth inboard and outboard closeouts exhibited bonding tab separation. The inboard closeout tab, which bonds the closeout to the inboard aluminum fitting, was missing (see figure 5). A green epoxy adhesive and a piece of scrim cloth had been used to bond the closeout tab to the aluminum fitting. Much of the area appeared to be unbonded. In some areas, the surface exhibited a dark brown color with a plain weave surface texture that was consistent with a remnant layer from the bonding tab.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5. Inboard closeout separation spar side (labeled a) and afterbody side (labeled b). &#x0D;\nCrack propagation features in the fractured adhesive were used to trace the fracture path from around the perimeter to an origin at the lower inboard location of the bonding region. Along the lower edge of the bonding region, lines radiated downward and outboard. Along the inboard edge, lines and crack arrest marks were consistent with a crack progressing from the lower side toward the upper side of the fitting. The features traced back to an origin area at the lower inboard region of the perimeter.&#x0D;\nThe outboard closeout was cracked along the upper lower edges of the bond line with the afterbody, as shown in figures 6 and 7. The crack along the lower edge started near a mid-body I-beam stiffener and progressed forward and aft about 1 inch, arresting before reaching the spar or trailing edge. Along the upper edge, a crack also extended forward and aft of the I-beam, and a closeout tab that was bonded to the forward portion of the upper afterbody skin was missing. The tab had peeled from the skin, and adhesive and carbon-fiber ply imprints were left behind. Examination of the delamination surface indicated that the tab delamination proceeded inboard and toward the leading edge. The damage to the outboard end of the flap was consistent with the onset of high-amplitude reverse bending loads.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 6. Outboard closeout overview (labeled a)and  end of crack along lower edge and peel region of bonding tab along upper edge (labeled b).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 7. Outboard closeout bonding tab separation on the spar side (labeled a) and afterbody side (labeled b).&#x0D;\nThe remaining three servo flaps from the accident helicopter were examined visually for signs of cracks, particularly around the inboard closeout, and the bond between the closeout and aluminum fitting was evaluated. All flaps exhibited cracking along the bond line between the closeout and the aluminum fitting, but the extent of cracking varied. The right red servo flap was sectioned in an area that passed through a crack along the underside of the flap. The cross-section through the crack indicated that the outer and inner skin plies were fractured beneath the surface crack, as shown in figure 8.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 8. Lower side of closeout (labeled a) and cross-section through the lower skin plies (labeled b). -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was engaged in external load fire-fighting operations when the accident occurred. After dropping several loads of water, the pilot reported abnormal noises and vibrations and stated \"it's my hydraulics\" before he lost airspeed and control of the helicopter. The helicopter made several uncontrolled rotations before colliding with terrain and erupting in flames. The wreckage was highly fragmented and most consumed by the postimpact fire. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic system continuity could not be confirmed due to fire damage. The servos exhibited exposure to fire, including an oxide layer on the outer surface, micro-cracks, resolidified metal, and deformation damage. Foreign high-density particles were found in the hydraulic system. Hydraulic flight control stiffness and hard-over conditions are most likely a result of a malfunction of the servo irreversible valve. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnly one of the three irreversible hydraulic valves was not destroyed in the postcrash fire. Examination of this valve found high-density metal particles deep within the valve assembly and preexisting damage to the seat of a check valve. Since all the servos were operated from a single hydraulic pressure source, it is likely that the other two irreversible valves also had similar particles within their assemblies. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForeign high-density particles and a worn check valve within the irreversible valve could have interfered with the valves’ proper operation and resulted in control stiffness or a hard-over condition. There was no evidence of preexisting mechanical damage on the three servo actuator pistons or rods as the internal moving parts within the servo actuators showed no evidence of gouging. There was no wear damage in the bushing areas or around the housing ball assembly. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological tests detected the antidepressant medication citalopram and an augmenting agent buspirone in the pilot’s system. Given that the pilot was performing complex firefighting tasks when the helicopter developed mechanical problems and he made reasonable decisions to attempt to land the helicopter, he appears to have been functioning at a high level. It appears unlikely that the pilot’s use of the antidepressants or his depression were factors in the accident.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s declaration that he had a hydraulic problem and the final uncorrected right hand descending spiral turn flightpath are consistent with what would be expected if the helicopter experienced control stiffness or a hard-over condition. However, due to the extent of the impact and postimpact fire damage, the reason for the loss of control could not be conclusively determined.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On August 19, 2020 about 0945 Pacific daylight time, an Arrow-Falcon Exporters, Inc., UH-1H, N711GH, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Coalinga, California. The pilot, the sole occupant was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a public use firefighting flight.&#x0D;\nThe accident flight was the pilot’s first day working the Hills Fire, which had started 4 days prior. The pilot took off at 0846 followed by another pilot who was flying a Bell 212 helicopter for another operator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter departure, both helicopters flew south until reaching a small lake/reservoir (the dip site) to fill up the external load buckets attached to their respective helicopters. Thereafter, they flew to a predetermined area and began to unload their water on the fire. After releasing the water, they would return back to the dip site. After the accident pilot delivered about two buckets of water to one location he moved to another location delivering about five buckets of water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Bell 212 pilot recalled that after he departed the dip site with a bucket of water, he heard the accident pilot communicate over the air-to-air radio that he felt \"abnormal noises and vibrations\" and that he was going to make a precautionary landing. The Bell 212 pilot dumped his water and caught up to the accident helicopter with the intention of assisting the pilot in finding a good area to land. He remained a few hundred feet behind and above the accident helicopter. The accident helicopter was about 1,000 ft above ground level and maneuvering at an airspeed between 60 to 70 kts. The accident pilot then stated that the helicopter's \"temps and pressures are good.\" A few seconds later the accident pilot stated \"it's my hydraulics.\" The Bell 212 pilot relayed that he should make a right turn and fly down the ravine to less mountainous terrain (the flats).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Radar Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter started to make a right turn and then banked back to the left while losing airspeed. The Bell 212 pilot noticed the helicopter still had its 100 ft longline and external load bucket attached and told the accident pilot to \"release your long line and get forward airspeed,\" The accident pilot then stated \"Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.\" The left turn steepened remaining in a level pitch attitude, and the helicopter began to make three or four 360° rotations (rapidly swapping the front and back), while drifting north-east. The helicopter then pitched in a nose-low, near vertical attitude and collided into terrain (see figure 2 below). A fire immediately erupted and the Bell 212 pilot made multiple trips to the dip site to fill his bucket and drop water on the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2: Pilot’s Statements Prior to Accident&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on a 35° slope with the main wreckage about 25 yards downslope from the initial impact. Most of the wreckage was consumed by fire; the tail rotor assembly was intact. The tail rotor blades were intact, with no evidence of rotational scoring. The wreckage was recovered to a secure location for further investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe/Controls&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was highly fragmented and mostly consumed by a post-crash fire. The airframe sections that remained were parts of the tailboom, tail rotor, engine deck, cabin doors, landing skid tubes, one cross tube, and the engine. The main rotor head, blades, stabilizer bar, and upper transmission including the rotor mast were lost during the wreckage recovery.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit was highly fragmented and damaged by fire, with most of the instruments destroyed and unreadable. The engine control panel were separated from the center console and all the switches on the panel were deformed downward. The caution warning panel, located within the wreckage debris and separated from the instrument panel, sustained fire damage and the front plate was illegible due to sooting/melting. The interior of the panel exhibited similar damage and the individual annunciator capsule positions had shifted as a result so the original location of individual bulbs could not be determined. Nine intact bulbs with filaments were removed from the remnants of the panel, of which two exhibited hot filament stretching; their associated position could not be determined.  The fuel valve switch had evidence of damage associated with impact and was unreliable for determining the switch position before impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPortions of the cockpit flight controls were identified, but a majority of the system was consumed by fire. The main flight control servos were separated from their input and output control rods. Fragments of both sections of the cyclic lateral control tubes and the lower mixing assembly were identified. The upper flight controls, consisting of the stationary and rotating swash plates and drive links, were not present for examination because they were dropped during recovery. The tail rotor control bell crank quadrant was not located. The tail rotor hydraulic servo was detached from the structure and sustained thermal damage; the input and output fittings were fractured. The tail rotor control forward cables, speed-rig turnbuckles, and aft cables remained within the tailboom. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe elevator spar remained in the tail section, and the left spar extended out of the left side of the tail boom. The elevator control horn assembly was in place in the tail section, and three elevator control bell cranks were identified. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nContinuity of the hydraulic system could not be confirmed due to fire damage sustained following impact. The hydraulic pump was separated from the transmission and was missing the splined drive shaft. The hydraulic filter was separated from its mount, and the input/output connectors were fractured. The filter screen was removed, inspected, and no debris was identified. The main rotor head, both main rotor blades, upper transmission, and rotor mast were not recovered, but both stabilizer bar dampers were recovered. Photos from on scene showed chordwise marks on various portions of the unburned blade. The burned blade was too damaged to identify surface score marks from the photos taken.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSegments of the tail rotor drive shaft were numbered from 1 to 6, starting at the tail rotor drive output of the lower transmission. Drive shaft segments 1 to 3 were not recovered and were presumed to have been consumed by the post-crash fire. The drive-shaft bearing-end that connects to the transmission tail rotor drive quill was identified, as well as the drive shaft ends that mate with the support bearings for segments 1 to 3. The aft end of segment 4 was connected to segment 5 through the support bearing. Drive segment 5 was connected to the 42° gearbox, and drive segment 6 was connected from the 42° gearbox to the tail rotor 90° gearbox. One tail rotor blade showed no observable damage, while the other blade had chordwise dirt streaks and heat damage on the outboard half of its trailing edge.  On the reverse side of that blade, the outboard 2/3 of the blade had fire damage to the skin and underlying layers. The blade also had a crease in the chordwise direction about 8 inches from the root.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe photos of the cargo hook on-scene and the post examination revealed that the hook portion had separated from its attachment hardware. The final location of the external load bucket is unknown, but the witness said he did not see the bucket being released.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nServos&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Materials Laboratory examined the left lateral hydraulic servo; right lateral hydraulic servo and its irreversible valve assembly; and the collective hydraulic servo for the main rotor of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe collective actuator, left lateral actuator, right lateral actuator, and an irreversible valve assembly were subjected to x-ray radiograph and computed tomography (CT) scanning to document each component’s internal condition. The results of the scan identified high density (metal) particles deep within the irreversible valve assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right lateral servo showed indications of exposure to a fire, including an oxide layer on the outer surface, micro-cracks, resolidified metal, and deformation damage. The upper housing was disassembled, and the ring seals were found to be fractured. The lower housing contained two circumferential inserts that functioned as raceways, which showed no evidence of wear or damage. The piston portion of the rod contained a groove that incorporated a ring seal, which also fractured into multiple pieces. The hydraulic servo cylinder contained an internal spool and sleeve assembly, but an attempt to pull the push-pull rod out of the port failed. No evidence of corrosion, gouge, or wear damage was found in any of the examined parts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDisassembly of an irreversible valve assembly for a right lateral servo, revealed the internal valves, including a sequence valve, check valves \"A\" and \"B,\" a differential pressure relief valve, and an accumulator valve. During disassembly, evidence of bending deformation damage was observed on the cover for the sequence valve, and the inner surface of the cover showed evidence of an oxide layer and micro-cracks. The piston head and sleeve contained ring seals that were fractured and could not be removed with needle-nose pliers. The internal parts of the sequence valve, check valves \"A\" and \"B,\" and the differential pressure relief valve were intact, except for the fractured ring seals. The seat portion for the check valve \"A\" showed evidence of wear damage, while the seat portion for check valve \"B\" showed no evidence of wear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left lateral and collective servos were disassembled in a manner that was similar to the right lateral servo. The observations made on those servos were similar to those found on the right lateral servo, with the exception that the left lateral servo’s piston was completely retracted (the other servos were in various positions, but not at such an extreme). It could not be definitively determined if this signature could have been indicative of a left hard-over condition and a simulation was not available to support this inquiry. It could not be determined if any of the servos were capable of function normally prior to impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHeat from the postcrash fire caused carbonization and multiple fractures of the elastomer seat rings, while foreign particles were found in the hydraulic system. It is unknown how much of the debris was introduced into the hydraulic system during the postcrash fire-fighting phase. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe servos and irreversible valve do not have a specified time-in-service before overhaul requirement and are considered an “on condition” part. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine sustained damage as a result of the impact. The inlet guide vanes displayed tearing and battering, and all five stages of the axial compressor blades were bent opposite the direction of rotation at the tips and displayed leading and trailing edge damage. Vanes on all four stages of the compressor vane assembly displayed leading and trailing edge damage. The interstage bleed centrifugal compressor impeller showed rotational scoring on the shroud line edges of the blades at the inducer with corresponding rotation scoring through 360°. The inducer of the impeller housing assembly and the centrifugal compressor impeller had material build-up on the leading-edge concave side of the blades. Vanes on the first stage power turbine nozzle and blades on the first stage power turbine rotor displayed trailing edge damage, all of which were consistent with the engine operation/rotation at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMetallurgical analysis of the first and second stage gas producer turbine blades identified aluminum, stainless steel, and magnesium deposits on the suction side and pressure side of the blades. These metal spray deposits are consistent with the engine operating at the time of impact. Additionally, white dust-like material covered the interior of the combustion liner. The NTSB Materials Laboratory analysis of the white residue material identified it as magnesium oxide using dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and the source of the magnesium can be attributed to the engine case which is constructed of magnesium. The source of the stainless steel can be attributed to the compressor section components such as the blades and stator assemblies. The source of the aluminum alloy is not internal to the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotorcraft Flight Manual&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe US Army UH-1H flight manual (TM 55-1520-210-10) emergency procedures section identifies the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSection 9-37. Hydraulic Power Failure. &#x0D;\nHydraulic power failure will be evident when the force required for control movement increases; a moderate feedback m the controls when moved is felt, and/or the HYD PRESSURE caution light illuminates. Control movements will result m normal helicopter response. In the event of hydraulic power failure:&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n1. Airspeed - Adjust as necessary to attain the most comfortable level of control movements. &#x0D;\n2. HYD CONT circuit breaker - Out. If hydraulic power is not restored: &#x0D;\n3. HYD CONT circuit breaker - In. &#x0D;\n4. HYD CONT switch - OFF. &#x0D;\n5. Land as soon as practicable at an area that will permit a run-on landing with power. Maintain airspeed at or above effective transitional lift until touchdown.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSection 9-38. Control Stiffness. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA failure within the irreversible valve may cause extreme stiffness in the collective or two of the four cyclic control quadrants. If the failure is in one of the two cyclic irreversible valves, caution is necessary to avoid over controlling between the failed and operational quadrants. &#x0D;\n1. HYD CONT switch - OFF then ON. Check for restoration of normal flight control movements. Repeat as necessary. If control response is not restored:&#x0D;\n 2. HYD CONT switch - OFF. If normal operation is not restore! &#x0D;\n3. Land as soon as practicable at an area that will permit a run-on landing with power. Maintain airspeed at or above effective transitional lift until touchdown.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n9-39. Flight Control Servo Hardover. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\na. Cyclic hardover is caused by a sequencing valve failure within the Irreversible valve on either or both cyclic servos. Cyclic servo hardover will cause the cyclic to move full night forward, full left rear, full left forward, or full right rear.&#x0D;\nb. Collective hardover is caused by a sequencing valve failure within the Irreversible valve on the collective servo. The collective will move to the full up or full down position. &#x0D;\nc. A failure of any flight control servo may render the helicopter uncontrollable unless the following action is taken. &#x0D;\n1. HYD CONT select - Select opposite position. &#x0D;\n2. LAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE at an area that will permit a run-on landing with power. Maintain airspeed at or above effective translational lift at touchdown.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Fresno County Sheriff-Coroner’s Office, Fresno, California autopsy report, the cause of the pilot’s death was multiple skeletal and visceral injuries due to blunt impact and the manner of death was accident. The medical examiner did not identify any significant natural disease. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the Fresno County Sheriff-Coroner’s Office detected ethanol at 0.11 grams per deciliter (gm/dL) in the pilot’s peripheral blood and at 0.068 gm/dL in gastric contents; toxicology testing was negative for tested-for drugs of abuse in blood and gastric contents. The FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory toxicology testing detected ethanol at 0.082 gm/dL in cavity blood and 0.082 grams per hectogram (gm/hg) in muscle tissue but did not detect ethanol in brain tissue. N-propanol was detected in the pilot’s cavity blood and muscle tissue and methanol was detected in his cavity blood. Tissue samples were reported as exhibiting putrefaction. The antidepressant citalopram was detected in the pilot’s blood at 5,857 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) and in his liver tissue; its active metabolite n-desmethylcitalopram was detected at 602 ng/mL in blood and in liver tissue. The anti-anxiety medication buspirone was detected in the pilot’s blood at 1.1 ng/mL and in his liver tissue. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "During an aerial survey flight when the helicopter was about 800 ft above ground level, the pilot felt a slight vertical vibration through the collective and airframe. The vibration immediately intensified to a severe lateral vibration in the main rotor system, and the pilot could not control the helicopter. While maneuvering for an emergency landing, the helicopter lost lift and impacted terrain short of the intended landing area, and a postimpact fire ensued. The pilot stated that the engine was producing power at the time of the accident. No evidence indicated an in-flight structural breakup, and all damage to the airframe occurred during the ground impact sequence. &#x0D;\nA fatigue crack was found on the leading&#x1E;edge abrasion strip of one of the main rotor blades. Given the flat fracture features of the fatigue cracking, the fatigue crack was present before the accident flight. However, this fatigue cracking showed no evidence of propagation into the blade spar and, therefore, was likely not a factor in this accident. The main rotor blade damage was likely due to ground and tailboom impacts; the examined portions of the main rotor blades showed no evidence of an in-flight failure of the main rotor blades. &#x0D;\nIn addition, no evidence showed any flight control disconnections, and further postaccident examination to determine if the flight control system had fractured could not be performed due to the extensive thermal damage. The helicopter’s hydraulic system was unable to be tested due to the damage resulting from the postcrash fire. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\nThe reason for the in-flight loss of control could not be determined based on the available evidence for this accident investigation. The helicopter was not equipped with, and was not required to be equipped with, crash&#x1E;resistant flight recorders. The lack of flight recorder data for this accident precluded further evaluation of the accident circumstances and pilot actions. This accident demonstrates the need for crash-resistant flight and image recorders aboard turbine-powered, nonexperimental, nonrestricted-category aircraft that are not currently required to be so equipped, as previously recommended by the National Transportation Safety Board.",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to the helicopter’s maintenance records, in November 2019 at Van Horn Aviation, Tempe, Arizona, for main rotor blade A092, the tip abrasion strip and trim tab were removed and replaced due to a trim tab debonding. For main rotor blade A093, the trim tab was removed and replaced for inspection. Both blades had a component total time of 829 hours.&#x0D;\nMain rotor blades serial Nos. A092 and A093 were installed on the accident helicopter on March 1, 2020, at a total helicopter time of 14,917 hours, and both blades had a component total time of 928 hours. Three 100-hour/12-month inspections were performed after installation, including an inspection performed on August 2, 2020 (6 days before the accident). &#x0D;\nOn July 1, 2020, the engine was removed and replaced due to reports of a high turbine outlet temperature and low power.&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter’s flight manual and the helicopter’s most recent weight and balance records, the helicopter’s maximum gross weight was 3,200 pounds, and the empty weight was 1,908 pounds. The operator estimated that the helicopter’s weight at the time of the accident was 2,700 pounds. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped with, and was not required to be equipped with, a crash-resistant flight recorder or cockpit image recorder. - On August 8, 2020, about 1100 central daylight time, a Bell 206B helicopter, N284S, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Marathon, Texas. The pilot was seriously injured, and the three passengers were fatally injured. The flight was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 aerial survey flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight was conducting an aerial survey in the Texas Black Gap Wildlife Management Area. The pilot reported that, about 5 minutes before the helicopter was to be refueled, he felt a “slight” vibration; at that time, the helicopter was operating at an altitude of about 800 ft above ground level and an airspeed of about 69 knots. The pilot further reported that the vibration, which lasted less than 30 seconds, started as a “slight vertical vibration” but “immediately intensified to a severe lateral vibration” that made the helicopter “impossible to control.” The pilot stated that the vibration affected the main rotor system blades and that he felt most of the vibration through the collective and airframe with no vibration in the anti-torque pedals. The pilot informed the passengers that he would be conducting an emergency landing. The pilot recalled that during the emergency landing, he observed two distinct blade paths prior to impact. The helicopter lost lift and subsequently impacted terrain short of the intended landing area. A postimpact fire ensued. The pilot stated that the engine was producing power at the time of the accident. - The pilot reported the temperature about the time of the accident was “heating up pretty good pushing around 100 degrees [Fahrenheit]” and did not recall the density altitude. - The pilot reported that he had accumulated about 2,500 flight hours in Bell 206L and 206B helicopters conducting aerial surveys in Texas, Alaska, Utah, and New Mexico. - The helicopter impacted hilly, rocky terrain in a remote area of west Texas at an elevation of about 5,160 ft. An on-scene examination revealed that most of the wreckage was in a compact area with the farthest piece of wreckage, a tip end section of a main rotor blade, estimated to be about 80 ft from the main wreckage. The postimpact fire consumed most of the main wreckage (the fuselage, engine, transmission, and portions of the main rotor blades). The tailboom had separated and was located near the fuselage; and the tailboom had sustained limited thermal damage. &#x0D;\nFurther examination of the tailboom showed that it was fractured in two large segments: the forward section containing the horizontal stabilizer and the aft section containing the vertical stabilizer and tail rotor. The aft end of the forward tailboom section was deformed to the right and showed evidence consistent with contact by a main rotor blade.&#x0D;\nThe forward landing gear cross-tube exhibited significant deformation; the aft cross&#x1E;tube showed minor deformation. The left and right skid tubes were fractured in multiple locations.&#x0D;\nThe main rotor assembly, including the yoke, mast, and swashplate, exhibited thermal damage, and no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation were noted with the assembly. Both main rotor blades’ inboard section remained attached to the yoke, displayed fractures located about 48 inches outboard of the yoke, and exhibited thermal damage. Large midspan-to-outboard end segments were found near the tail rotor and vertical stabilizer. A 20-inch section of one main rotor blade tip (referred to as blade A) was found about 80 ft from the main wreckage. Smaller sections of blade skin and foam core were distributed within the main wreckage area.&#x0D;\nThe main transmission housing was partially consumed by the postcrash fire. The engine-to-transmission driveshaft remained attached to the main transmission input quill and remnants of the freewheeling unit. Rotational scoring was noted on the driveshaft. &#x0D;\nThe tail rotor remained installed on the tail rotor gearbox output shaft, and both tail rotor blades remained installed on the tail rotor yoke. Both tail rotor blade tips displayed impact damage, and the remainder of the blades were relatively intact. No anomalies that could have precluded normal operation were noted with the tail rotor system.&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor drive train exhibited fragmentation. All drive shaft segments were located, and rotational scoring was noted at the hanger bearing locations within the tailboom sections. Continuity through the tail rotor gearbox was noted when the gearbox was manually rotated. No evidence indicated any binding or abnormal sounds. &#x0D;\nFlight control continuity could not be established due to thermal and impact damage. Various pieces of connection hardware and bellcranks for the flight control system did not exhibit evidence of separation at their respective fasteners.&#x0D;\nThe engine was located within the main wreckage on its left side at its normally installed location. The engine did not exhibit signatures of uncontainment or separation between its modules. Disassembly of the engine revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The engine fuel system and components were unable to be tested due to thermal and impact damage.&#x0D;\nThe cockpit instruments, including the caution and warning panel, exhibited significant damage due to impact and thermal damage. &#x0D;\nMaterials Laboratory Examination&#x0D;\nPortions of the main rotor blades were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board’s Materials Laboratory for further examination. Because the data plates for the main rotor blades had separated from their blades due to exposure to the postcrash fire, the main rotor blades were identified as “blade A” and “blade B” for this work.&#x0D;\nBlade A Examination&#x0D;\nSix primary pieces of the main rotor blade were recovered; the largest portion of the blade was about 9 ft long and consisted of part of the constant chord section, which was fractured at both ends. The trailing edge was separated along the entire length, and the interior of the blade was exposed. &#x0D;\nThe lower skin fracture surfaces on the outboard section were predominantly translaminar and slanted inboard about 45° relative to the chord direction, consistent with bending loading. &#x0D;\nTwo impact marks were observed on the leading-edge abrasion strip, and both corresponded to locations of chordwise fractures through the blade skins. One impact mark, located about 18 inches inboard of the outboard end of the abrasion strip, showed areas of dark gray and blue material transfer. The other impact mark was located at the outboard end of the abrasion strip. The upper surface of the abrasion strip was deformed inward and aft with spanwise scratches and periodic streaks of a light silver appearance. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that the composition of the streaks was mostly aluminum. &#x0D;\nThe leading-edge abrasion strip on the tapered tip section was fractured chordwise about 19 inches inboard from the blade tip. The fracture surface was relatively flat and featureless for about 2.4 inches from the lower aft edge except for a spanwise secondary crack that intersected the primary fracture at the origin, which was about 1.5 inches forward of the lower aft edge. Areas of blue, white, and gray material transfer were observed near the crack. Visible curved crack arrest marks on multiple offset planes were observed propagating for about 0.4 inches, consistent with progressive fracture under dynamic loading conditions (as evidenced by fluctuations in stress amplitude and load path). &#x0D;\nThe terminus of the crack arrest marks was located about 2 inches forward of the upper aft edge of the abrasion strip. The fracture surface from the crack terminus to the upper aft edge of the strip exhibited a slanted fracture surface and dull appearance, consistent with a shear lip as a result of final separation due to overstress. The flat/progressive fracture was observed over about 58% of the leading-edge abrasion strip fracture surface at that location. Striations observed on the fracture surface were consistent with fatigue.&#x0D;\nScratches and witness marks were observed along the abrasion strip outboard of the tip piece. The witness marks appeared gray, blue, white, and silver, and gold/brown in color. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy identified elevated amounts of aluminum at the lighter gray/silver marks, consistent with material transfer. Circular marks, with elongated streaks emanating from them, were observed about 14.5 inches inboard from the blade tip and were equally spaced within 1 inch, consistent with a structure rivet pattern.&#x0D;\nRefer to the NTSB Materials laboratory Factual Report located in the public docket for additional materials laboratory examination details for Blade A. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBlade B Examination&#x0D;\nThe recovered blade was about 11 ft long, and evidence of thermal damage was observed over most of the blade. The inboard end was fractured and exhibited a 45° slanted fracture relative to the span. Visible buckling deformation and tearing separation was observed in the leading-edge abrasion strip about mid-span. The trailing edge strip was fractured chordwise with a predominantly flat, translaminar fracture surface with inter- and intralaminar separation extending away from the chordwise fracture. The fracture features were consistent with aft bending loading before fracture. Blade tip fragments that were recovered did not exhibit visible thermal damage, consistent with tip fragmentation before the postcrash fire. A witness mark, consistent with impact damage, was observed on the upper surface of the leading-edge abrasion strip about 6 inches inboard of the outboard end of the constant chord section abrasion strip. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter pilot was returning to his property located adjacent to a river. As the helicopter descended toward the water at a 25° angle with low forward airspeed, the pilot applied power to arrest the descent. However, the helicopter continued to descend until it impacted the river short of the intended landing area. The pilot and two passengers survived the impact and a third passenger drowned. &#x0D;\nThe investigation revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have prevented the normal operation of the helicopter. Recovered flight data indicated the engine was producing power at the time of impact. Weather reports and statements from the pilot and witnesses indicated that the helicopter descended steeply with little forward airspeed and a tailwind of about 5 knots, which is a flight profile conducive to vortex ring state. The pilot’s reported lack of collective authority when increasing power to arrest the helicopter’s descent is also consistent with the helicopter entering vortex ring state. A pilot's failure to monitor altitude, airspeed, and rate of descent during an approach can result in a flight profile conducive to vortex ring state. &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Vortex Ring State&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA's Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21B), vortex ring state, formerly referenced as settling-with-power, \"describes an aerodynamic condition in which a helicopter may be in a vertical descent with 20 percent up to maximum power applied, and little or no climb performance: &#x0D;\nSituations that are conducive to a vortex ring state condition are attempting to hover out of ground effect (OGE) without maintaining precise altitude control, and approaches, especially steep approaches, with a tailwind component.&#x0D;\nThe following combination of conditions is likely to cause settling in a vortex ring state in any helicopter: &#x0D;\n1. A vertical or nearly vertical descent of at least 300 fpm. (Actual critical rate depends on the gross weight, rpm, density altitude, and other pertinent factors.) &#x0D;\n2. The rotor disk must be using some of the available engine power (20–100 percent). &#x0D;\n3. The horizontal velocity must be slower than effective translational lift.&#x0D;\nWhen recovering from a vortex ring state condition, the pilot tends first to try to stop the descent by increasing collective pitch. The traditional recovery is accomplished by increasing airspeed, and/or partially lowering collective to exit the vortex. In most helicopters, lateral cyclic thrust combined with an increase in power and lateral antitorque thrust will produce the quickest exit from the hazard.”&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA's Helicopter Flying Handbook, hovering more than one main disc (rotor) diameter above the surface is considered hovering OGE. The accident helicopter rotor diameter was 35 ft 1 in.&#x0D;\n - According to the helicopter’s flight manual, and the helicopter’s weight and balance chart, the helicopter’s gross weight at the time of the accident would have been about 4,440.2 lbs. The limitations section of the helicopter's flight manual indicated a maximum gross weight of 5,350 lbs. The longitudinal and lateral CG locations were within flight manual limits.&#x0D;\n - On August 3, 2020, at 1941 eastern daylight time, an Airbus EC130-B4 helicopter, N55GJ, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Knoxville, Tennessee. One passenger was fatally injured, and the pilot and two additional passengers were not injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nAfter refueling the helicopter, the pilot and his passengers departed McGhee Tyson Airport (TYS), Knoxville, Tennessee, about 1826 for a flight in the local area. About 1940 the pilot made a right circling approach over the Tennessee River toward a landing site on his property near the river’s edge. He stated that he “was descending with low power and a 25° angle of descent, slowing to come to a hover at low speed over the water.” He further stated that he was planning to hover taxi to the landing site at a height about 75 feet above the water and that when he added power to arrest the descent, the helicopter “started to settle.” He stated he “pulled max power to stop the settling,” but it was as if the helicopter “didn't have any power” and it continued to descend until it impacted the river. &#x0D;\nA witness on the neighboring property reported that the helicopter “came from the south and kind of hovered over the water pretty low.” She stated that it hovered longer than usual before tilting toward the south and descending into the water. &#x0D;\nA passenger stated that when the helicopter descended toward the water in a level attitude, the left “skid hit and then rotor hit” and the helicopter was “torqued into the water on the left side.” The pilot and two of the passengers were able to egress the helicopter before it sank; however, one passenger was unable to egress and was subsequently recovered by first responders.&#x0D;\nA pilot who had previously flown with the accident pilot reported that he spoke to the accident pilot the morning after the accident. He stated that the accident pilot recalled he was making a steep approach and he “came in vertically with little-to-no airspeed,” estimating that his descent rate was greater than 300 feet per minute.&#x0D;\n - Examination of the accident site by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the helicopter came to rest on the bottom of the Tennessee River about 435 ft and 149° from the intended landing site on the pilot’s property. The helicopter’s fenestron was recovered floating nearby. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was recovered from the river mostly intact. Examination of the wreckage revealed a large hole in the left side windshield; the left door window broken out; damage to all rotor blades consistent with water impact; and two of the four suspension bars fractured midspan. The tailboom remained attached to the fuselage, and the fenestron separated from the tailboom just aft of the ring frame.&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe and flight control system components revealed no evidence of a pre-impact failure or mechanical malfunction that would have precluded normal operation, and the pilot reported that there were no mechanical malfunctions or failures prior to the accident sequence. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a vehicle and engine monitoring display and a digital engine control unit that stored records of failure messages associated with engine operations. The data revealed no failures or limit exceedances prior to impact and indicated the engine was running at the time of impact. All failure indications occurred around the time of impact. No preimpact anomalies were noted with the engine that would have precluded the normal production of power.&#x0D;\n -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On July 24, 2020, about 1316 eastern daylight time, a Brantly B2B helicopter, N383ES, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Monrovia, Indiana. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 maintenance test flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness stated that the pilot was performing a maintenance test flight, after a 100-hour interval and annual inspection was performed. The pilot completed three or four short flights around the pilot's property before taking off and traveling southerly at an altitude of about 20 ft above ground level. The pilot’s wife stated that it sounded like the helicopter was “missing.” A witness stated that it looked like the helicopter was exiting effective translational lift when the helicopter dipped, it turned right abruptly, and hit the ground. A post-crash fire started immediately, and the wreckage was destroyed.  &#x0D;\n  &#x0D;\n - The pilot initially survived and was transported to a hospital for specialized burn/trauma care. No significant pre-existing natural disease was documented. An early hospital blood test for ethanol was negative. The pilot succumbed to his injuries on the day of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Marion County Coroner's Office performed the pilot’s autopsy, which was limited to an external examination only. According to the autopsy report, the cause of death was thermal burn injuries, and the manner of death was accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing detected the medications amlodipine and atorvastatin in the pilot’s blood. Those medications generally are not considered impairing. Also detected in blood were morphine, ketamine, norketamine, and etomidate, all of which were attributable to medications administered to the pilot during his initial medical care after the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n - The wreckage was destroyed by impact forces and post-crash fire. The landing gear skid were separated from the fuselage. The main rotor assembly and tail rotor assembly were separated from the fuselage and tailboom, both of which were resting along the wreckage path. The tailboom, with the tail rotor driveshaft, was attached to the fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the engine cylinders using a borescopeshowed no amonalies. Continuity of the engine valve and drive train to the accessory section was confirmed. The accessories could not undergo functional testing due to post-crash fire and impact damage.

    "FactualNarrative": "On July 17, 2020, about 0854 Pacific daylight time, a Hiller UH-12D helicopter, N2297W, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Mehama, Oregon. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 aerial application flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo radar information was available for the flight. The support truck operator reported that the helicopter departed from the truck and flew toward a field. Shortly after the helicopter departed, the truck operator heard the pilot report over the radio that he was “going down.” Witnesses reported that the engine noise changed pitch and became loud before impact and that there was heavy smoke and fire at the accident location. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n - The operator reported that the pilot had flown agricultural helicopters for about 50 years. The operator also reported that the pilot sprayed the fields where the accident occurred for many years and that he knew the fields well.  &#x0D;\n - The helicopter struck several large trees and came to rest inverted at the base of a large tree. The cabin area sustained extensive crush damage and was consumed by postimpact fire. The fuel tank was also consumed by postimpact fire, and the bottom of the transmission was exposed. The forward portion of the tailboom exhibited thermal damage, and the aft portion of the tailboom had fractured and separated just forward of the tail rotor assembly. A portion of a main rotor blade was located about 360 ft north of the main wreckage, and just northeast of  the main rotor blade was a tail rotor blade; both came to rest in a tree field. The stabilizer and a tail rotor blade with its hub attached were located farther northeast in an area of large trees. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a postaccident examination, significant crush damage was noted on the right side of the engine. Fuel was found in the line to the fuel nozzle and within the fuel control unit. The fuel control arm/lever was found in the “off” position. Engine control continuity was unable to be established from the collective twist grip to the engine due to extensive cockpit and airframe damage. The control cables remained secured at their respective arms on the power turbine governor and fuel control units. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe six-stage axial compressor was seized; its housing exhibiting thermal and crush damage. Once the housing was removed, the compressor rotated smoothly. Some dirt and debris were noted on the compressor guide vanes. The gas producer and power turbine rotated smoothly. Light circumferential scoring was noted on the gas producer turbine housing. The accessory gearbox housing was removed; all components were oily and unremarkable. The fuel control unit, power turbine governor, bleed valve, fuel spray nozzle and fuel pump assembly were bench tested and found to function normally. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom had fractured and separated just forward of the tail rotor assembly. The tail rotor gearbox was found fractured and separated, and no anomalies were noted. The gearbox drive to the tail rotor hub remained intact, but its grooves displayed some rotational damage. No corresponding rotational damage was noted on the hub. One tail rotor blade remained attached to the tail rotor hub, and the other tail rotor blade was found fractured and separated. The tension-torsion straps for fractured/separated blade extended from the tail rotor hub and were fractured and splayed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor assembly was provided to the National Transportation Safety Board Materials Laboratory for further examination. The examination revealed that 10 of the 11 tension-torsion straps had fractured from fatigue cracking followed by overstress fracture. The fatigue cracking initiated at multiple locations along the bores in contact with the cylindrical plain bearing. Wear, in the form of smearing, gouging, spalling, and galling of the faying surfaces, led to the fatigue crack initiation. The fatigue cracks then propagated perpendicular to the area with the highest tensile stresses and at the thinnest locations along the bearing bore.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter was on its fourth short external load flight to reposition supplies for ground firefighting crews using a 100-ft-long line when the accident occurred. The pilot had flown a similar route for each of his three previous uneventful flights that morning. When the helicopter reached a plateau, about halfway through the flight, witnesses observed it begin to fly erratically, transitioning into a brief high nose-up pitch attitude and then wobbling and banking in a series of irregular movements before stabilizing. A few seconds later, the helicopter wobbled and banked erratically again and then entered another high nose-up attitude before it descended rapidly towards the ground. Witness statements indicated that the helicopter either banked left or right while in a high nose-up attitude just before it descended and impacted the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA meteorology study found that at the time of the accident, the density altitude was about 7,980 ft; the wind was from the west-southwest about 10 knots; and sky conditions were clear. Comparison of the helicopter’s flight track at the time of the accident and the reported wind conditions indicated the helicopter likely encountered a right quartering tailwind during the first upset and a left quartering tailwind during the second (final) upset. Although the helicopter was operating in high density altitude conditions with a low forward groundspeed, the pilot had completed three successful external load lifts from the same departure point to the same destination before the accident with no reported helicopter instability. Further, although dust devils were reported by witnesses on multiple days before the accident, there were no indications from witnesses that any were present at the time of the accident. Therefore, it is unlikely that meteorological conditions contributed to the inflight loss of control.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left lateral servo was found at near full extension, and the right lateral servo was found slightly more than half extended. These positions closely corresponded to a cyclic position of full aft and either right or left and were consistent with the extreme nose-up position of the helicopter immediately before its vertical descent to the ground. The helicopter would normally be controlled by the pilot via small fine cyclic inputs that would rarely exceed half of the full deflection of the cyclic control stick. An intentional full aft and either right or left deflection of the cyclic control by the pilot would not be consistent with the type of operation being performed with an external load, which requires smooth moderate control inputs and adjustments. The control servo positions were consistent with the preimpact attitude of the helicopter and likely indicate that the flight controls were positioned in a full aft and an undetermined lateral cyclic position and fixed there until impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSince it is unlikely the pilot intentionally manipulated the cyclic to produce the erratic movements displayed by the helicopter, these movements were likely the result of a hydraulic failure, flight control stiffness event, or hydraulic hardover. A light bulb analysis found that the HYD PRESSURE warning light filament was not stretched at the time of impact, which suggests that the hydraulic pressure had not dropped below 400 pounds per square inch and that the hydraulic control switch had not been turned off by the pilot; therefore, a hydraulic failure likely did not occur. A control stiffness or hydraulic hardover was likely as either could have been caused by a failure within the irreversible valve on either lateral servo. Either malfunction would have made it difficult for the pilot to operate the cyclic and maintain control of the helicopter. However, the investigation was unable to determine whether the loss of control was due to a hydraulic hardover or flight control stiffness event due to a lack of available evidence as the servo components were extensively damaged by impact and postcrash fire.    &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "The USFS required that an interagency load calculation (Form OAS 67/FS 5700) be completed for all flights and that a new calculation be completed when operating conditions changed by 1,000 ft elevation or 5°C in temperature. An interagency load calculation was completed before the pilot’s first flight in anticipation of relocating six loads via longline from site H2 to site H5. According to the completed form, the departure and destination were both listed at a pressure altitude of 5,000 ft with an outside ambient temperature of 35°C. The helicopter equipped weight was listed as 5,545 lbs; the flight crew weight was 150 lbs; the fuel weight was 1,200 lbs (171 gallons); and the total operating weight was 6,895 lbs. Based on the pilot’s performance computations, which included a gross weight of 9,500 lbs, the maximum allowable external payload was 2,605 lbs. The payload manifest listed the external cargo weight at the time of the accident as 1,975 lbs consisting of 19 cases of Gatorade and the net, hook, swivel and longline. An independent review of the manifest calculated the weight of 19 cases of Gatorade (31 lbs per case) to be 589 lbs plus the hook, swivel, net, and long line for a total external load weight of 664 lbs.&#x0D;\nAccording to the USFS interagency helicopter load calculation form, the helicopter had about 171 gallons of JET-A fuel onboard before its first flight on the morning of the accident. The USFS provided documentation showing that the helicopter flew for about 25 minutes while transporting its first three loads before the accident flight.&#x0D;\nHydraulic System Information &#x0D;\nThe helicopter flight controls were powered by a hydraulic system that operated the flight control cylinders. According to the rotorcraft flight manual (RFM): &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic system is used to minimize the force required by the pilot to move the cyclic, collective and pedal controls. A hydraulic pump, mounted on and driven by the transmission supplies pressure to the hydraulic servos. The hydraulic servos are connected into the mechanical linkage of the helicopter flight control system. Movement of the controls in any direction causes a valve, in the appropriate system, to open and admit hydraulic pressure which actuates the cylinder, thereby reducing the force-load required for control movement. Irreversible valves are installed on the cyclic and collective hydraulic servo cylinders to prevent main rotor feedback to the cyclic and collective in the event of hydraulic system malfunction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner of the helicopter operator, who was also an experienced pilot in the accident helicopter, described the amount of force the pilot was required to exert on the flight controls during hydraulic off operation as significantly higher than when the hydraulic boost was enabled. This can limit how quickly a pilot can make control inputs and after a few minutes can result in physical fatigue.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe RFM provided descriptions of three potential hydraulic power related emergency events: hydraulic power failure, flight control stiffness, and flight control servo hardover. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHydraulic Power Failure&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHydraulic power failure will be evident when the force required for control movement increases; a moderate feedback in the controls when moved is felt, and/or the HYD PRESSURE caution light illuminates. Control movements will result in normal helicopter response. In the event of hydraulic power failure:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1. Airspeed – Adjust as necessary to attain the most comfortable level of control movements.&#x0D;\n2. HYD CONT circuit breaker – Out. If hydraulic power is not restored:&#x0D;\n3. HYD CONT circuit breaker – In. &#x0D;\n4. HYD CONT switch – OFF.&#x0D;\n5. Land as soon as practicable at an area that will permit a run-on landing with power. Maintain airspeed at or above effective transitional lift until touchdown. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nControl Stiffness&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA failure within the irreversible valve may cause extreme stiffness in the collective or two of the four cyclic control quadrants. If the failure is in one of the two cyclic irreversible valves, caution is necessary to avoid over controlling between the failed and operational quadrants.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1. HYD CONT switch – OFF then ON.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCheck for restoration of normal flight control movements. &#x0D;\nRepeat as necessary.&#x0D;\nIf control response is not restored:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n2. HYD CONT switch – OFF.&#x0D;\nIf normal operation is not restored:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n3. Land as soon as practicable at an area that will permit a run-on landing with power. Maintain airspeed at or above effective transitional lift until touchdown.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight Control Servo Hardover&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\na. Cyclic hardover is caused by a sequencing valve failure within the Irreversible valve on either or both cyclic servos. Cyclic servo hardover will cause the cyclic to move full [r]ight forward, full left rear, full left forward, or full right rear.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nb. Collective hardover is caused by a sequencing valve failure within the irreversible valve failure on the collective servo. The collective will move to the full up or full down position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nc. A failure of any flight control servo may render the helicopter uncontrollable unless the following action is taken.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1. HYD CONT select - Select opposite&#x0D;\nposition.&#x0D;\n2. LAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE at an area&#x0D;\nthat will permit a run-on landing with power. Maintain&#x0D;\nairspeed at or above effective translational lift at&#x0D;\ntouchdown.&#x0D;\n - On July 7, 2020, about 1213 mountain standard time, a Bell/Garlick UH-1H helicopter, N623PB, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Payson, Arizona. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 external load flight. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was owned by Airwest Helicopters LLC and operated by the United States Forest Service (USFS) at the time of the accident supporting firefighting efforts against the Polles Fire in the Tonto National Forest about 11 nautical miles (nm) west of Payson. The fire was accessible only by helicopter due to the rugged terrain, and ground crews were largely dependent on helicopters for transportation and support.  &#x0D;\nAccording to witnesses, the helicopter was transporting supplies externally using a 100-ft-long line and cargo nets for a USFS hotshot firefighting crew that was repositioning on the ground. The pilot transported three loads from site H2 to site H5 uneventfully before the accident and was using an indirect route to the north to avoid a fire area. (See Figure 1.) While transporting the fourth load, witnesses observed the helicopter begin to fly erratically when it reached a plateau while enroute to its destination. During this time, a witness stated that he observed the helicopter enter a high nose-up pitch attitude, and the external payload began to swing. The helicopter then displayed irregular movements for several seconds before the external payload settled and the helicopter appeared to stabilize. However, after about 3 seconds, multiple witnesses observed the helicopter wobble and bank erratically before it entered a steep nose-up attitude and then descended rapidly to ground impact. Two witnesses reported that the helicopter started to twist to the right as it descended. The witnesses did not observe the helicopter on fire during the accident flight nor did the pilot report any anomalies over the assigned air-to-ground radio frequency, Air Guard, or any other assigned frequencies for the fire. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Depiction of helicopter flight path based on witness statements&#x0D;\n - Wind &#x0D;\nAt 1215, the reported wind at Payson Airport (KPAN) located about 11 nm east of the accident site was from 240° at 9 knots with gusts to 18 knots. In addition to the weather at Payson Airport, the local wind information was captured by three remote automated weather stations near the accident site. At 1222, the closest station located 8.5 nm northeast of the accident site reported wind from the southwest at 10 miles per hour (mph) with gusts to 20 mph. At 1211, the next station located 11 nm east of the accident site reported wind from the west-southwest at 7 mph with gusts to 16 mph. At 1209, another station located 14.5 nm northeast of the accident site reported wind from the west-southwest at 2 mph with gusts to 15 mph. Each of the three stations and KPAN indicated temperatures between 32° C (90° F) and 34° C (94° F) with relative humidities of 8 to 10%. The density altitude based on the conditions reported was 7,980 ft.&#x0D;\nDust Devils&#x0D;\nMultiple forest firefighters who witnessed the accident provided their weather observations at the time of the event. None of the witnesses observed any clouds or thunderstorms in the area during the event. Two witnesses reported that they had observed dust devils in the area. According to one of these witnesses, the wind speed at the time of the accident was about 5 to 10 mph with higher wind speeds on top of the mesa. He observed dust devils on the day of the accident and large dust devils in the days leading up to the accident. Another witness reported seeing what he described as “ash whirls” in the area but could not remember when they occurred. Most of the witnesses reported light wind from the southwest and did not report any wind gusts.&#x0D;\n - According to the USFS, the pilot was required to renew his pilot qualification card every 12 calendar months. The pilot’s most recent qualification card was issued on April 17, 2020 and listed an expiration date of April 2021. He was approved for multiple applications including: “water retardant, bucket; Ext load, &gt;50’ longline vertical reference (VTR); and snorkel (mirror &amp; VTR)”. The pilot was permitted to fly a UH-1 helicopter with an expiration of April 2023 for each of the abovementioned applications. According to the USFS, qualification cards are issued annually to ensure all associated administrative requirements are met, while special missions are evaluated every 3 years. &#x0D;\n - The helicopter wreckage came to rest about 0.5 nm north of its drop off destination (site H5) oriented on a heading of 074° magnetic. The wreckage was highly fragmented and mostly consumed by postcrash fire. All major structural components of the helicopter were accounted for at the accident site. The helicopter’s external payload was found 123 ft southeast of the main wreckage. &#x0D;\nWreckage Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered to a storage location in Arizona, and a wreckage examination was performed by a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) helicopter specialist with representatives from the engine manufacturer, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the helicopter operator. The largest pieces of wreckage included the main rotor head, transmission, engine, tail boom aft of the elevator, tail rotor, and gearbox. Additionally, the external load long line, cargo hook, and cargo net were examined. A visual inspection of the long line assembly revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal helicopter operation.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll flight control tubes and connections in the cockpit and leading up to the upper deck were fragmented or destroyed. The helicopter’s three hydraulic servos (right lateral, left lateral, and collective) were separated from their respective connections.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor had separated from the mast below the rotor head, and the remaining section of mast that was attached to the rotor head displayed fracture signatures consistent with overload. Both main rotor blades were fractured and thermally damaged. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotational scoring was observed on the engine power output shaft where the KAflex coupling attached. Movement of the output shaft produced a corresponding rotation of the power turbine rotor. The power turbine spool also rotated without resistance. Examination of the compressor section revealed tearing and battering damage to the 1st stage axial compressor blades. The power turbine section blades and vanes were accounted for and undamaged. Metal spray was observed around the 2nd stage power turbine nozzle vanes. No pre-existing conditions were found that would have prevented normal operation of the engine. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter’s maintenance records showed that the tail rotor assembly had been inspected and re-rigged on multiple occasions outside of routine maintenance from January 18, 2019, to June 24, 2020. Postaccident examination of the tail rotor drive shafts found that drive shaft Nos. 3 and 4 had torsionally sheared. Drive shaft Nos. 5 and 6 were connected to the gearbox. The tail rotor gearbox input and output drives rotated smoothly by hand with no binding. Both tail rotor blades remained attached to the tail rotor hub and to the gearbox through the tail rotor mast.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the long line and hook assembly revealed normal wear with no significant damage noted. The assembly was not connected to the helicopter. The eyelet and “pear ring” were attached at the beginning of the long line. The long line cargo hook at the end of the line opened and locked in the closed position manually. The electrical connections between the long line and the hook assembly were not present; however, several separated wires were present at the eyelet and “pear ring” end of the long line. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnnunciator Panel &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn NTSB Materials Laboratory examination of the cockpit annunciator panel was completed to determine the status of the light bulb filaments from each annunciator. There were no missing bulbs in any of the individual lights, and hot filament stretching was not found in any bulb. The system was designed so that the HYD PRESSURE light would illuminate when the system pressure dropped below 400 pounds per square inch. Turning off the cockpit hydraulic control (HYD CONT) switch would also illuminate the HYD PRESSURE light.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLeft and Right Lateral Servos&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left lateral servo piston exhibited 10 inches of extension, and the right lateral servo piston showed 7 inches of extension after the accident. An exemplar helicopter of the same make/model was used to determine the resulting cyclic position based on the left and right lateral servo piston measurements. Testing showed that the accident helicopter servo positions corresponded to a cyclic position about full aft of its center position. The testing further showed that the accident helicopter servo positions corresponded to a cyclic position that was either left or right of center. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe internal configurations of the left and right lateral servos were documented using x-ray radiograph and computed tomography scanning. A review of these images revealed indications that the cap covering the left lateral actuator irreversible sequence valve opening was bulging and deformed consistent with exposure to the extreme heat of the postcrash fire. The irreversible valves assemblies for both the right lateral servo and the collective servo had been liberated from their servo assemblies by impact forces, were not recovered with the wreckage, and were presumed destroyed by the postcrash fire.  Hence, those valve assemblies were not examined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to an aircraft status report furnished by the helicopter operator, the left lateral servo had accumulated about 669 flight hours since it was last overhauled on August 6, 2015, and the right lateral servo had accumulated 617 flight hours since it was last overhauled on January 20, 2016. The servos were required to be inspected “on condition” only and did not have a time before overhaul requirement. &#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Shortly after takeoff on an instructional flight, a helicopter was maneuvering at a low altitude when the engine rpm “skyrocketed,” and the engine lost total power; the flight instructor (who was at the controls) reported hearing “backfiring” at the time, although the engine was still running. The flight instructor then had to maneuver the helicopter to avoid nearby power lines, but the helicopter impacted terrain. The main rotor blades struck the tailboom, and the helicopter subsequently spun around about 180° before coming to rest. A postcrash fire then ensued, which consumed most of the helicopter. Additionally, the student pilot stated to a witness after the accident that the helicopter was losing power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn engine examination revealed that detonation had occurred in two of the four engine cylinders. (Detonation in a piston engine occurs when the fuel-air mixture in a cylinder detonates or explodes prematurely instead of being ignited by spark plugs and burning evenly and smoothly, as occurs with normal combustion.) Furthermore, damaged spark plugs were observed in one of the detonated cylinders as well as another cylinder. The combined effects of the detonation and damaged spark plugs likely caused the loss of engine power. Because the loss of power occurred at a low altitude, the flight instructor likely did not have enough altitude to adequately establish a steady-state autorotation to avoid the helicopter’s impact with terrain.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "The Federal Aviation Administration’s Airplane Flying Handbook states the following about detonation:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDetonation, as the name suggests, is an explosion of the fuel-air mixture inside the cylinder. During detonation, the fuel/air charge (or pockets within the charge) explodes rather than burns smoothly. Because of this explosion, the charge exerts a much higher force on the piston and cylinder, leading to increased noise, vibration, and cylinder head temperatures. The violence of detonation also causes a reduction in power. Mild detonation may increase engine wear, though some engines can operate with mild detonation regularly. However, severe detonation can cause engine failure in minutes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe handbook also stated, “excessive cylinder temperature can lead to detonation, which in turn can cause catastrophic engine failure.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, the Federal Aviation Administration Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook—General stated that “detonation causes explosive burning of the fuel which creates an increased cylinder pressure, excessive cylinder head temperatures, and decreased engine performance.” According to the engine manufacturer, “severe or prolonged detonation can cause damage to the cylinder head and pistons. In some extreme cases, the connecting rod can be bent or broken, the cylinder head may crack or fail, or the piston ring lands may break.”&#x0D;\n - The engine maintenance logbook revealed that the engine time since overhaul was 407.4 hours. The logbook showed that, during the annual inspection on July 15, 2019 (almost 1 year before the accident), the mechanic performing the inspection “cleaned [the spark] plugs.” &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Enstrom height and velocity diagram revealed that the helicopter’s altitude and airspeed before the accident were not within the shaded regions, which represented areas, altitudes, and airspeeds to avoid during operation. &#x0D;\n - On June 23, 2020, about 1701 Pacific daylight time, an Enstrom 280 FX helicopter, N280MM, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Hayden, Idaho. The student pilot was fatally injured, and the flight instructor was seriously injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor stated that, shortly after takeoff from Coeur d’Alene Airport, Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, he temporarily leveled off the helicopter at an altitude of about 100 ft above ground level and accelerated to more than 100 mph to ensure that all the helicopter systems and indications were properly functioning. Shortly thereafter, the engine’s rpm “skyrocketed,” and the engine lost total power; the flight instructor could hear “backfiring.” The helicopter then lost altitude, and the flight instructor maneuvered the helicopter to avoid nearby power lines. Subsequently, the low rotor rpm horn sounded; at that time, the engine was still running. As terrain approached, the flight instructor pulled the collective and increased the throttle, but the helicopter had no rpm. Shortly afterward, the helicopter impacted terrain, the main rotor blades contacted the tailboom, and the helicopter spun about 180° before coming to rest. A postcrash fire ensued, which consumed most of the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to witnesses, the helicopter was maneuvering at a low altitude before it crashed in an open field. Two witnesses stated that the helicopter was flying at or below the power line level. One witness stated that the tail of the helicopter was moving up and down and that the helicopter did not seem to be flying smoothly. The witness further stated that the helicopter’s tail swung around quickly before ground impact. One witness who provided assistance after the accident reported the student pilot stating that the helicopter was losing power and that the helicopter did not strike anything before ground impact. &#x0D;\n - The Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office responded to the accident site, which was in a field northwest of a road intersection. The Kootenai County Fire Department extinguished the postaccident fire. The wreckage was surrounded by a burnt area on the ground that was about 45 ft in diameter. The front section of the fuselage came to rest on a northeast heading. The tail rotor assembly was located west of the wreckage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed extensive thermal damage, which prevented a thorough examination of most systems and components. The tailboom was separated from the fuselage, and the horizontal stabilizer was separated from the tailboom. The engine also sustained thermal damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn engine examination revealed no evidence of a catastrophic mechanical malfunction or failure and no anomalies with the transmission. When the top and bottom spark plugs were removed, the examination showed that the No. 3 cylinder bottom spark plug was missing part of its center electrode, and that the No. 4 cylinder bottom spark plug was missing its electrode. Furthermore, when all six cylinders were removed, the No. 2 cylinder piston was found to exhibit a sandblasted appearance consistent with detonation. Additionally, the No. 4 cylinder head and piston exhibited signatures and damage consistent with detonation.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was applying insecticide to a farm field and the accident flight was the first time the pilot had sprayed the field.  Once he arrived at the site, 3 hours late, the pilot conducted two circular passes to survey the field, then landed, and the ground crew loaded the insecticide into the hopper. The pilot was not briefed of any hazards to operations prior to the flight by the ground crew or farmer. After takeoff, the pilot started applying the chemicals. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was performing the spraying operation and was flying on a northerly heading when it impacted a non-energized wire. The wire was mounted about 30 feet up a 40 ft pole that also contained a hunting stand and stretched about 250 ft across the field from west to east where it connected to a tree bordering the field. The wire had been installed at least 20 years earlier and was installed high enough that a tractor or combine had clearance to move beneath it during harvest. &#x0D;\nClear daylight conditions existed at the time of the accident. The sun was at 39.85° above the horizon at an azimuth of 272.39° and was very close to being directly in line with the wire. It is possible that the sun’s position relative to the wire would have made the 5/16-inch wire more difficult to see as the shadow of the wire and pole would have been nearly directly under the wire rather than offset. &#x0D;\nThe pilot, unfamiliar with the field, running late, and without the benefit of a detailed discussion with the landowner, relied solely on his brief visual surveillance of the field while operating the helicopter. Although the pilot likely observed the pole and hunting stand during his surveillance, it is likely that he did not see the wire due to its small diameter. Therefore, shortly after initiating the application of the insecticide, the pilot’s failure to see and avoid the wire resulted in the helicopter impacting the wire and the pilot’s subsequent loss of control and impact with terrain.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "On June 18, 2020, at 1700 eastern daylight time, a Robinson R66 helicopter, N4QW, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Pikeville, North Carolina. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was being operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 aerial application flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to company personnel familiar with the operation, this was the first time the pilot had sprayed the farm field, and the pilot had not received any information about hazards in the area to be sprayed. The pilot arrived at the field about 3 hours later than planned. Prior to the application of the insecticide, the pilot performed two circular passes over the field to look for any hazards or obstructions; he then landed, and the ground crew loaded the insecticide into the hopper. Shortly after takeoff, the pilot began spraying operations. The helicopter was flying over the field during the spraying operation when an eyewitness heard a \"popping\" sound and saw the helicopter’s sudden descent and impact with the terrain. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted a non-energized wire, also known as a \"dove wire\" that was used for hunting. The wire was mounted about 30 feet up a 40 ft pole that also contained a hunting stand and was stretched across the width of the corn field (250 ft) from west to east (See figure 1).  The wire was connected to a tree on the east side of field, perpendicular to the helicopter’s flightpath. The wire had no markings and was 5/16 inch thick. According to the farmer, the wire was installed at least 20 years earlier and was installed high enough for a tractor or combine to get underneath it during harvest.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 - Accident site overview of pole, wire, and wreckage location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage path was oriented on a heading of about 030° magnetic, and the distance from the wire impact to the final wreckage location was about 275 ft. The tail rotor empennage separated about 2 ft aft of the rotating beacon light and was found in a nearby irrigation ditch. The tail rotor assembly and blades separated from the empennage.  All major components of the helicopter were accounted for at the accident site. Both main rotor blades remained attached to the hub. About 20 ft of 5/16 inch diameter braided steel wire was wrapped around the blade pitch change horns, swashplate, pitch links, rotor hub, and both rotor blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn addition, there were tears and scuff mark damage to the blades that was consistent with contact with the wire. Cyclic and collective control continuity was confirmed. Tail rotor control continuity could not be confirmed due to impact damage. Examination of the wreckage revealed no mechanical discrepancies or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the autopsy performed by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries, and the manner of death was accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA’s Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified trimethoprim (a prescription antibiotic) and tamsulosin (a prescription medication used to treat symptoms of an enlarged prostate) in the pilot’s blood and urine. Neither of these are considered impairing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the US Naval Observatory Astronomical Applications department, bright daylight conditions existed at the time of the accident. The sun was at 39.85° above the horizon (altitude) at an azimuth of 272.39°.&#x0D;\n -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On June 2, 2020, about 1250 Pacific daylight time, a Bell 206L3 Helicopter, N65PJ, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Fairfield, California. The pilot and two passengers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 133 rotorcraft external load operation.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was operated by PJ Helicopters under contract from Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) to perform power line repair work. A fuel truck driver associated with the operation stated that he arrived at the landing zone about 0900 on the morning of the accident, where the accident pilot and helicopter were waiting. Flight operations began between 1100 and 1130. &#x0D;\nAccording to the operator around 1250, the two linemen had completed work for the day, and the pilot proceeded to their location to pick them up via longline from the tower on which they had been working. At that time, for unknown reasons, the linemen were lowered to the ground and disconnected from the long line. The helicopter circled for several minutes before it was called back, and the linemen reattached to the longline. A witness stated that he saw the accident helicopter ascend toward the lower line of a set of powerlines. The main rotor contacted the line, followed by the helicopter impacting terrain, where it rolled downhill, and came to rest in a ravine.&#x0D;\nAccording to PG&amp;E, the impacted power line was about 200 ft above ground level (agl), located about mid span between two towers at the bottom of a valley. - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration second-class medical certificate was issued on December 23, 2019, at which time he reported 3,099 total hours of flight experience, with 422 hours in the previous six months. - The helicopter was recovered from the site for examination. Flight control continuity was established from the single cockpit control to the control surfaces through breaks in the system consistent with impact damage. &#x0D;\nContinuity was confirmed from the main rotor drive shaft to the main rotor. The freewheeling unit operated normally. The transmission-to-engine main drive shaft remained attached at the transmission via the Kaflex. The aft Kaflex was fractured.&#x0D;\nOne main rotor blade (white blade) was fractured about 73 inches from the blade grip. The trailing edge of the blade was split down its length starting about 13 inches from the grip. The tip of the rotor blade was separated from the blade and displayed evidence of a wire strike. The white pitch change link was fractured about 6 inches from the lower end of the tube. &#x0D;\nThe other main rotor blade (red blade) was fractured about 36 inches from the grip. The outer skin separated from the carbon layup of the top surface of the blade. The interior core separated from the lower surface of the blade. The trailing edge of the blade was split down its length in a few locations with the interior core missing. The red pitch change link was fractured at the lower end connection. &#x0D;\nExamination of the transmission, pylon, and hydraulics system revealed no anomalies.&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies. The compressor impeller was undamaged and displayed evidence of dirt ingestion consistent with operation at the time of impact. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot, who held a pilot certificate with ratings for airplanes, was training for a helicopter rating through the flight school. After conducting a dual instructional flight with his instructor, the pilot serviced the helicopter with fuel and departed on a solo flight, during which he planned to perform several takeoffs and landings at a nearby airport. Security cameras at the nearby airport captured the helicopter performing takeoffs and landings on the runway. A witness next saw the helicopter over a tree line about 1 mile from the runway. The witness described that the helicopter was \"sputtering” and that it turned back in the direction it had come from. The engine sounds then ceased, and the helicopter dove and impacted the ground. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examinations of the accident site, helicopter, and engine did not reveal evidence of any preimpact mechanical failure or malfunction of the structure, engine, drivetrain, or flight controls that would have precluded normal operation. There also was no evidence of any fire or explosion. Although no anomalies were found with the engine or drivetrain, no power signatures were present on the drivetrain or leading edges of the rotor blades, suggesting that the engine may not have been operating at the time of impact. The fuel tank and carburetor were impact damaged and displayed no evidence of residual fuel. There was no odor of fuel, and no observed fuel blight (browning of vegetation) in the vicinity of the wreckage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther examination of the wreckage showed corrosion on the fuel quantity sensor fasteners, and on the adjustment screws used to calibrate the unit. The aluminum probe shaft, which should have been in the fuel tank, was missing, along with the side wires. The ends of the side wires, which were broken and corroded where they came out of the assembly, indicated that the probe and side wires may not have been present before the accident. The fuel tank filler cap was found hanging by its chain. It would attach to the fuel tank but was heavily rusted and there was little or no positive friction to ensure that the cap would remain in place.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a postaccident interview, the pilot’s instructor stated that he checked the helicopter’s fuel level when he performed a preflight inspection before the 1.4 hour-long lesson that preceded the pilot’s solo flight. The instructor noted that there appeared to be about 20 gallons of fuel in the 33-gallon fuel tank when he checked it. After the dual flight lesson, when the pilot refueled the helicopter, the instructor observed the pilot place the nozzle in the fuel tank filler of the helicopter fuel tank and was carrying on a conversation with the student from the driver’s seat of the fuel truck. The student pilot then told the instructor; “Good to go” and gave a “thumbs up.” The instructor did not see the student pilot secure the fuel tank filler cap on the fuel tank filler. It is possible that the conversation between the student and the flight instructor may have distracted the student during the fueling procedure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe amount of fuel onboard the helicopter when the pilot departed on the accident flight could not be determined based on available evidence, nor could it be determined if the pilot failed to properly secure the fuel tank cap or if it opened inflight due to its condition; however, given the lack of fuel at the accident site, no evidence of fuel spillage, and the absence of mechanical anomalies, the circumstances of the accident are consistent with a total loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor stated that the accident helicopter’s fuel gauge worked, but it was not 100% accurate and that the low fuel caution lights did not work on the accident helicopter or on the flight school’s other operable helicopter. He stated that a few months before the accident, the flight school placarded the low fuel lights on both helicopters they operated as inoperative. Additionally, the flight school’s fuel truck was not equipped with a meter to record the quantity of fuel dispensed. Instead, users would estimate the amount of fuel that was in the helicopters by using the fuel gauges and checking the tank visually.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter’s Rotorcraft Flight Manual, if the amber FUEL LOW caution light came on in flight, about 1 gallon of usable fuel remained in the fuel tank. The manual instructed that, “If fuel low caution light comes on during flight, land immediately.” Although the fuel low caution system was found placarded as inoperative, review of the helicopter’s maintenance log revealed no entries documenting the malfunction and deferral. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) for the helicopter indicated that the fuel low caution light system should have been repaired within 10 days after the malfunction was recorded in the aircraft maintenance logs. Further review of the MMEL also indicated that the low fuel caution light, “May be inoperative provided procedures for monitoring fuel quantity are established and used.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring an interview with an FAA inspector, the owner of the flight school initially stated that several weeks before the accident, during an inspection of the helicopter, the fuel low caution system was found to be inoperative. The mechanic then placarded the helicopter. The owner also explained that “everyone” knew the system was inoperative and as a policy, the helicopters were always rented with a full tank of fuel. In a subsequent letter to the FAA, the owner of the flight school advised that only one of the flight school’s helicopters had an inoperative low fuel caution system. He further advised that the placard that was placed on the accident helicopter was placed there by mistake, and that it was supposed to be placed only on the other helicopter. He stated that, at the time of the accident, the low fuel caution system in the accident helicopter was functioning properly, as was the fuel quantity indicating system, and that the fuel quantity gauge in the helicopters were very accurate and reliable. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner of the flight school also stated that the MMEL allowed for having a fuel low caution system inoperative if there was a procedure for monitoring fuel quantity. The procedure they employed in the event that the low fuel caution system was not working was to always fully refuel the helicopters between flights and limit flights to a length of 1.5 hours. He also advised that the flight school used the fuel quantity gauge in the helicopter, in addition to the refuel policy and the flight length limit, to do this. Review of the written operational documents provided by the operator showed that none of these policies were documented.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGiven the conflicting statements provided by the flight school owner and the flight instructor regarding the operational status of the fuel quantity indicating system, it was unclear whether the fuel low caution system was operable at the time of the accident. Given the condition of the fuel quantity indicating system components documented during the postaccident examination of the wreckage, and the statement by the flight instructor that the fuel quantity indicating system was not “100% accurate,” it was unlikely that the system was able to provide the pilot with an accurate accounting of the helicopter’s fuel state. The condition of the fuel quantity indicating system, the fuel tank cap, and the uncertainty surrounding the documentation of the operational state of the low fuel caution system suggested that the operator lacked an adequate system to ensure the airworthiness of the helicopters that it was providing to its customers. Had these systems been fully operational at the time of the accident, it is possible that the student pilot might have recognized and/or avoided the helicopter’s critical fuel state before the fuel was completely exhausted and the engine lost total power.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 30, 2020, about 1132 central daylight time, a Schweizer 269C-1 helicopter, N9421P was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Ozark, Alabama. The student pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 instructional flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 0900, on the day of the accident, the student pilot met his flight instructor at Eagle Aviation Academy, which was located at a private heliport in Midland, Alabama. According to the student pilot's flight instructor, prior to the lesson, the flight instructor pushed the helicopter out of the hangar and performed a preflight inspection. Afterwards, the flight instructor and the student pilot did a final weather check and then the instructor waited on the student pilot while the student pilot also conducted a preflight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the student pilot was done with his preflight, they took off about 0906. They started off with confined area exercises including two steep approaches and two maximum performance takeoffs. Afterward, they came back to a grass field near the flight school and the flight instructor demonstrated one straight in autorotation, followed by the student pilot performing two straight in autorotations. Then they transitioned to another nearby field, and they did two, 180° autorotations. They landed back at the flight school about 1035 after about 1.4 hours of flight time. The flight instructor performed a post flight walk around and they \"topped it off with fuel.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor then went into his office and waited for the student pilot to finish his preflight. Once he finished his preflight, they talked about his solo flight which would be a 1.1-hour long flight, staying in the local area and doing a couple normal approaches and takeoffs at Ozark-Blackwell Field Airport (71J), Ozark, Alabama that they used regularly for training. They also looked at the weather and then the student pilot took off about 1110. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMotion activated security cameras at 71J, next captured the helicopter performing takeoffs and landings on runway 31 about 1115, and then around 1131. The helicopter was next observed by a witness over a tree line in a residential area about 1 mile off the departure end of runway 31. According to the witness, the helicopter was \"sputtering\", then it was observed to turn back in the direction it had come from, the engine sounds ceased, and the helicopter dove rapidly and impacted the ground. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe student pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, airplane multi-engine land, and instrument airplane. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second-class medical certificate was issued on February 15, 2019, at which time he reported 340 total hours of flight experience. The flight instructor stated that the student pilot had accrued about 66.9 total hours of flight time through the flight school, that he had provided 26.3 hours of dual instruction to the student pilot. The flight instructor also advised that the student pilot had accrued 8.9 hours of solo flight time in helicopters, and estimated that the student pilot would need 7 more hours of dual flight training before taking his checkride.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of FAA and helicopter maintenance records revealed that the helicopter was manufactured in 2000. A logbook entry dated July 10, 2018, indicated that the helicopter was purchased in non-flyable storage condition and was reassembled using various new, reconditioned, and overhauled components. The helicopter's most recent 50-hour inspection was completed on April 4, 2020 (about 56 days before the accident). At the time of the inspection, the helicopter had accrued 5,387.4 total hours of operation, and the engine had accrued 1,720 hours of operation since major overhaul.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter revealed that a tail rotor gearbox (P/N z369-A-5400 “E”, S/N 87083) manufactured for Hughes Tool Company by Western Gear Corporation (which predated the date of manufacture of the helicopter) was installed. According to the FAA Type Certificate Data Sheet, this component was prohibited for use on the helicopter, was not listed in the manufacturer’s illustrated parts catalog for the helicopter, and was not listed in Schweizer’s Mandatory Service Notice (N-229.1), which addressed part number conversions from McDonnell Douglas (Hughes) 369 series parts to Schweizer 269 series parts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Schweizer 269C-1 Rotorcraft Flight Manual, if the amber FUEL LOW caution light came on in flight, approximately one gallon of usable fuel remained in the fuel tank. It instructed that, “If fuel low caution light comes on during flight, land immediately.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed no evidence of any fire or explosion.  The helicopter impacted a 60- to 70-foot-tall tree before coming to rest. Tree limbs up to about 8 inches in diameter were broken and were found lying within and on the wreckage. A significant amount of oil was leaking from the engine. The main rotor blades remained attached to the hub and displayed upward bending and chordwise wrinkling. The leading edges of the blades were predominantly undisturbed and the control rods to the main rotor hub remained connected. The tail boom was separated from its mounting location and was found near the main wreckage. The tail rotor was still connected to the tail rotor gearbox and the tail rotor gearbox remained attached to the tailboom, which displayed minimal damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument panel was bent forward. The panel light switch was in the “OFF” position, the beacon and position light switches were in the “ON” position, and the battery and alternator switches were in the “ON” position. The carburetor heat control lever was found to be about 1-inch travel from the “OFF” position stop, the fuel mixture control was in the “FULL RICH” position, the fuel shutoff control was in the off position (full in), and the magneto key switch was in the “BOTH” position. The trim switch was in the “RIGHT” position, the clutch control switch guard was open, and the clutch control switch was in the “ENGAGE” position. The circuit breakers for the trim, and clutch were both in. The fuel low caution light system was placarded as inoperative. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 33-gallon fuel tank was impact damaged, there was no evidence of residual fuel, and the fuel tank filler cap was found hanging by its chain. The carburetor was impact damaged, and its float bowl was devoid of fuel. There was no odor of fuel, and no observed fuel blight (browning of vegetation) in the vicinity of the wreckage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe and all flight critical components were accounted for.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll four landing gear dampers were accounted for as well as the landing gear skids. The frame assembly had separated into multiple individual pieces. No evidence of failure was evident on all four of the cluster fittings. Both lower mast attach members were still attached to the mast and the airframe. The center mast attach fitting was separated at the mast attachment after retrieval from the wreckage site. The floor was separated from the cabin seat deck. The vertical fin was crushed, and the horizontal fin was separated from the helicopter. The leading edge of the horizontal fin displayed dents consistent with striking foliage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left seat belt system was still in place inside the helicopter while the right seat belt system was broken at its attach points. Both seat assemblies and interior components were accounted for. The instrument panel was intact but crushed in the back. The right control stick was broken at the fitting. The left control stick was not broken at the fitting. Both collective sticks were installed and accounted for.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cyclic control was connected from both left and right sides to the swashplate assembly, but was not connected fore and aft due to an impact-fractured casting. The rod end was still attached to the casting.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe collective controls also appeared to have been connected before impact, as the attachment bolts and hardware was still in place. The primary collective casting was broken. The throttle cable also appeared to be connected before impact, as all the connecting hardware and portions of the cable remained attached to the carburetor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel shutoff was inoperable due to a severe bend in the cable but was connected to the fuel shutoff valve. The mixture control was operable but not attached to the carburetor. The mixture control was in the full rich position and the fuel shutoff valve was in the open position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor drive shaft was sheared at the opening of the tail boom adjacent to the belt drive system. The drive shaft showed no twisting tendencies, but displayed creases in the drive shaft consistent with the helicopter falling through tree branches and debris landing on the tail boom. The attachment of the tail rotor drive shaft at the tail rotor gearbox was secure, the teeth of the tail rotor drive gear were intact, and the tail rotor gearbox chip detector was free of debris. There were no signs of impact on the leading edges of the tail rotor blades, and the blades remained attached to the tail rotor drive assembly. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pitch control (PC) links for the tail rotor drive assembly were both intact and the swashplate assembly for the tail rotor drive operated freely. One PC link was bent and the other appeared undamaged. The rotating bearing for the tail rotor drive spun freely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe eight belts that comprised the main belt drive assembly remained attached to the H-Frame pulley system. After removing the drive belts and the H-Frame assembly from the wreckage, it was confirmed that the upper pulley was installed with no anomalies and the sprag clutch was operable. The drive pulley and idler pulley showed no abnormal signs of operation, and the belt actuator was intact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter removal of the blue and red main rotor blades from the main rotor’s hub (the yellow blade had been previously removed during the wreckage recovery), examination revealed that the retainer showed signs of the pitch bearing assemblies and the blades being pulled up consistent with the main rotor falling through foliage. The blue and red pitch links were separated at the pitch bearing assemblies. The yellow pitch link remained attached, although the rod end at the pitch bearing attachment was bent at an approximate 90° angle, consistent with the helicopter falling through foliage with low or no rotation of the main rotor hub.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll three main rotor blades displayed little or no damage to the leading edges. Most of the damage was on the bottom sides of the blades, and the rear seams of the blades were separated and blown out at various positions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lower coupling drive shaft appeared in good condition with no noted anomalies. Both ends of the drive shaft were well lubricated. Three of the blades on the fan, which was attached to the engine flywheel, were broken. No indication of flywheel rotation during impact was observed, and the inside of the scroll did not display any rotational marks or scoring from the flywheel assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe control tubes from the lower transmission housing to the swashplate assembly were intact. The control tube from the anti-torque pedals to the bellcrank was sheared and was separated from the bellcrank. The cables for the anti-torque system were separated and displayed evidence of tensile overload at the separations.  The collective control was attached to the bellcrank, and the bellcrank displayed impact damage. The cyclic assembly was operational for the left and right inputs, but the forward and aft movement was restricted by a bellcrank that was impact damaged. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel tank was impact damaged, with the upper and lower fittings for the fuel quantity and low fuel sensor separated from the tank. The fuel lines were present. Examination of the fuel sensor revealed the presence of corrosion on the fasteners, and corrosion on the FULL, EMPTY, and LOW ADJUST screws used to calibrate the unit. The aluminum probe shaft was missing. The side wires (apart from the ends, which were broken and corroded where they came out of the assembly) were also missing. The fuel line to the fuel pump was separated from the fitting. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the fuel strainer revealed debris inside the strainer; however, the screen was clear of obstructions. The aluminum tube was severed from the assembly. The supply hose was pulled away from the fitting, but was still attached to the lower fuel tank adapter plate. The fuel cap would attach to the fuel tank, but was heavily rusted and there was little or no positive friction to ensure that the cap would remain in place.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained partially attached to the airframe through the tubular engine mounts. The intake and exhaust tubes were partially crushed. The oil sump was fragmented and separated from the engine. Both magnetos were separated from the engine and were found dangling from the ignition harness. The left magneto mounting flange was fractured. The magneto was rotated by hand and produced spark from all four ignition towers. The right magneto mounting flange was also fractured. The magneto was rotated by hand and did not produce spark from any ignition tower. The magneto was partially disassembled and water was observed in the magneto. The magneto also displayed evidence of impact damage internally, as the gear brush was bent inward and not making contact, one of the coil wedges was loose, and the coil was loose in the frame.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ignition harness was impact damaged, The Nos. 2, 3, and 4 top spark plugs, and the Nos. 2 and 4 bottom spark plugs exhibited gray coloration and worn normal condition. The No. 1 top spark plug was impact separated. The carburetor was fractured across the throttle bore, impact separated from the engine, and fragmented. The brass floats were intact, and no damage was noted. The carburetor fuel inlet screen was free of debris. The throttle and mixture control cables were separated from the carburetor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine crankshaft was rotated by turning the cooling fan and continuity of the crankshaft to the rear gears was confirmed. Compression and suction were observed from the Nos. 1, 2, and 4 cylinders. The Nos. 1 and 3 cylinders displayed impact damage. Only faint compression and suction was observed from the No. 3 cylinder. The Nos. 1 and 3 cylinders were removed. No damage other than impact damage was noted to the cylinders, pistons, or valves, and the Nos. 1 and 3 connecting rods were free to rotate on the crankshaft. Continuity of the camshaft to the valvetrain was confirmed. Oil was observed in the engine, and the oil suction screen and oil filter media were absent of metallic debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Postmortem External Examination was performed on the student pilot by the Alabama department of Forensic Sciences. The cause of death was reported as multiple blunt force injuries. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for carboxyhemoglobin, ethanol, glucose, or drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInoperative Equipment&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA, 14 CFR 91.213(d) allows certain 14 CFR Part 91 operators to fly an aircraft with inoperative instruments or equipment even though regulations generally require that all equipment installed on the aircraft be operative at the time of flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSome operators of aircraft, based on the kind of operation or size and type of aircraft are required to have a Minimum Equipment List (MEL) to operate the aircraft with inoperative instruments or equipment. However, operators of some types of helicopters can operate under part 91 without an MEL, such as small rotorcraft (12,500 pounds or less maximum certificated takeoff weight) for which a Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL) has been developed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe inoperative instruments and equipment cannot be:&#x0D;\nPart of the VFR-day type certification instruments and equipment prescribed in the airworthiness regulations under which the aircraft was type certificated&#x0D;\nIndicated as required on the aircraft’s equipment list&#x0D;\nIndicated as required on the aircraft’s Kinds of Operations Equipment List for the kind of flight operation being conducted&#x0D;\nRequired by 14 CFR 91.205 (Powered civil aircraft with standard category U.S. airworthiness certificates: Instrument and equipment requirements.) or any other rule of 14 CFR part 91 for the specific kind of flight operation being conducted&#x0D;\nRequired to be operational by an airworthiness directive&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe inoperative instruments and equipment must be removed from the aircraft, the cockpit control placarded, and the maintenance recorded, or deactivated and placarded “Inoperative.” If deactivation of the inoperative instrument or equipment involves maintenance, it must be accomplished and recorded in accordance with 14 CFR Part 43 (Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, Rebuilding, and Alteration).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFinally, a pilot, who is certificated and appropriately rated under 14 CFR Part 61 (Certification: Pilots, Flight Instructors, and Ground Instructors), or a person, who is certificated and appropriately rated to perform maintenance on the aircraft, must determine that the inoperative instrument or equipment does not constitute a hazard to the aircraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the FAA MMEL for the helicopter revealed that the fuel low caution light system was listed as “Repair Category C”. According to the MMEL definitions issued by the FAA, “Items in this category shall be repaired within ten (10) consecutive calendar days (240 hours), excluding the day the malfunction was recorded in the aircraft maintenance record/logbook”. Further review of the MMEL also indicated that the fuel low caution light, “May be inoperative provided procedures for monitoring fuel quantity are established and used.” &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the helicopter’s maintenance records did not reveal any entries regarding deferral of the fuel low caution light under the MMEL. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditional Information from Flight Instructor&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring an interview with the flight instructor on June 10, 2020, he expanded on the information he had provided advising that at the flight school they would usually refuel the helicopters before putting them away in the hangar. The last time that the accident helicopter flew before the day of the accident, was on May 25, 2020, and it was flown by him and the student pilot during a dual lesson. He was not sure who refueled the helicopter during that lesson.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the morning of the accident prior to the dual lesson, the flight instructor, checked the fuel when he preflighted the helicopter, and then the student pilot preflighted the helicopter. The flight instructor noted that there appeared to be about 20 gallons of fuel in the fuel tank when he checked it.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing that dual flight, the flight instructor performed a post-flight inspection and assisted the student pilot in refueling the helicopter. The flight instructor stated that he drove the refueling truck to the helicopter and remained in the truck while the student pilot refueled the helicopter. The flight instructor observed the student pilot place the nozzle in the fuel tank filler of the helicopter fuel tank and was carrying on a conversation with the student from the driver’s seat of the fuel truck. The student pilot then told the instructor “Good to go” and gave a “thumbs up.” The student pilot then placed the nozzle back on the fuel truck, the flight instructor turned off the pump on the fuel truck, and he drove away to park it. He did not observe the student pilot secure the fuel cap on the helicopter’s fuel tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor advised that fuel gauge worked on the helicopter, but it was not 100% accurate and that the low fuel lights also did not work on the accident helicopter and on the flight school’s other operable Schweizer 269 – N2074C. He was unsure but thought that the low fuel light stopped working on N2074C first. A few months before the accident, the flight school placarded the low fuel lights on both helicopters inoperative. After the accident they removed the placard on N2074C.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor also advised that fuel (100LL) was stored at the flight school in a 1,000-gallon tank. There was no meter on the tank, and he believed that there was no filter on the 1,000-gallon tank. They would transfer fuel from the 1,000-gallon tank to the fuel truck when the fuel truck tank was empty. The fuel truck had a filter and fuel drain but also did not have a meter. They had no set procedures for sumping the truck. They would just check it from time to time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThey would estimate the amount of fuel that was in the helicopters by using the fuel gauges and checking visually.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditional Information from Flight School Owner&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn FAA inspector spoke with the owner of the flight school and asked him about the placarded FUEL LOW caution light. The owner of the flight school told the inspector that several weeks before, they were doing an inspection and discovered the light inoperative. The mechanic then placarded the system. The owner of the flight school also explained that everyone knew the system was inoperative and as a policy, the aircraft are always rented with a full tank of fuel. The LOW FUEL caution light had been discovered during an inspection previously.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the owner of the flight school, the MMEL allowed the system to be inoperative. After reviewing the logbooks though, the inspector did not see any such related discrepancy entered. He then spoke with the mechanic who placarded the helicopter and asked him why he had not placed a discrepancy in the logbook. He said he thought it was more important to get it placarded first. He also stated that the helicopter had been running well, recently had a 25-hour inspection, and he had looked at the helicopter, the day of the mishap.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn June 15, 2020, in a letter to the FAA, the owner of the flight school advised the FAA that, he had only one Schweizer 269C-1 helicopter with a low fuel level caution light go inoperative, and that was on another helicopter which was recently repaired. He further advised that the caution placard that was placed in the accident helicopter was placed there by mistake, it was to be placed in N2074C, which in fact had a placard in it also. Additionally, he advised that the mechanic put one in each helicopter and that the low fuel light in the accident helicopter was functioning properly as was the fuel quantity gauge, that the fuel quantity gauge in 269C-1 helicopters were very accurate and reliable, and that when they received from the student pilot the information that that the low fuel caution light was inoperative in N2074C, they ordered a replacement sensor from Kinzie Industries. They were sent the wrong one so another was ordered but they had yet to receive it. On N2074C though, they were able to “repair and adjust” the one that was still installed on it now, so the low fuel caution was working.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner of the flight school also attached the maintenance procedures for working on the low fuel level sender which were photocopied pages from the Helicopter Maintenance Manual that when reviewed, were found to contain highlighted sections and signoffs by the mechanic in the margins of the pages, as well as dates of “29May20” and “3Jun20”. Additionally, “N2074C Low Fuel Warn inop” was printed on one page and “N2074C Low fuel Warn” on another page. However, the owner of the flight school did not provide maintenance records from N2074C which indicated that the low fuel level caution light in N2074C had been deferred per the MMEL, and how the discrepancy had been cleared.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner of the flight school also stated that the procedures they employed in the event the low fuel level light was not working was to always refuel the helicopter between flight periods and the periods are to be no longer than 1.5 hours. With 32 gallons of fuel on board and a burn rate of 12-15 gallons per hour (worst case) for 1.5-hour flights, it would leave at least 1 hour of extra fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, he stated that the MMEL clearly stated that having a low fuel caution light inoperative was allowed if you have a procedure for monitoring fuel quantity, and that they use the gauge in the helicopter which was fully operational and accurate, in addition to the hourly limit per flight period (1.5 hours). However, no written operational guidance that stated this procedure was to be employed by Eagle Aviation Academy was provided by the owner of the flight school.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe also stated that as part of Eagle Aviation's Standard Operating Procedures for refueling the helicopter, the pilot in command (PIC) was responsible for fuel management before, during and after flight, and that once the student solos, they were responsible for all aspects of the flight because they were acting as the PIC.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot of the police helicopter reported that, while making a right orbit over a scene during a night flight, he felt a “strong vibration” in the controls, and the helicopter rotated rapidly to the right. The pilot recalled no unusual sounds, warning horns, or caution or warning lights before the event. According to the pilot, the helicopter was “spinning like [the] tail was not functioning,” and he responded by performing the emergency procedure for “loss of tail rotor.” He lowered the collective and pushed the cyclic forward “to gain forward airspeed and airflow over the vertical stabilizer.” Automatic dependent surveillance data showed that the helicopter began a tight right turn as its groundspeed accelerated from 10 to 30 knots. The groundspeed remained at 30 knots for about 5 seconds before slowing to 20 knots. The right turn then continued and tightened, and the helicopter flew straight for the final 5 seconds of flight. The helicopter descended rapidly until it impacted an unoccupied building and terrain, which destroyed the helicopter. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of preimpact failures of the tail rotor control or drive systems. Further, there was no evidence found of a preimpact failure of the helicopter structure, main rotor system, cyclic and collective flight controls, or the engine. Based on the available data, the reason for the vibration described by the pilot could not be determined.&#x0D;\nA video taken by a ground witness showed the helicopter in a rotating descent before impact. Evaluation of the video revealed that the helicopter’s yaw rate increased from 146° to 178° per second while the helicopter was visible and that the helicopter’s yaw was to the right, which was opposite the rotation of the main rotor blades. However, the video did not record the onset of the rotation.  &#x0D;\nA performance study considered whether a loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) or a vortex ring state had occurred during the accident sequence. If the pilot’s statement that he accelerated to try to gain control of the spinning helicopter corresponds with the increase in speed from 10 to 30 knots, the yaw would have begun before that time and preceded the final tightening right turn. During the 30 seconds before the increase in speed, the helicopter was on a track where it would have encountered the reported winds as a right quartering headwind of low magnitude; this wind was not conducive to main rotor disc interference LTE, weathercock stability LTE, or tail rotor vortex ring state LTE. Further, the study determined that a vortex ring state was not consistent with the helicopter’s apparent level flightpath at the likely onset of the spin, and a vortex ring state does not usually result in an uncontrolled spin.&#x0D;\nRegarding loss of translational lift LTE, the performance study determined two factors that might have contributed to the uncommanded right yaw event: the increased anti-torque requirement when the helicopter was below the onset of translational lift and the right rolling moment induced by the introduction of translational lift when the helicopter was accelerating from low speed. However, the helicopter was not equipped with a flight recorder that could have provided additional data about when the yaw event began, the helicopter’s attitude and power, and the pilot’s inputs; therefore, the investigation could not determine the reason for the uncommanded right yaw.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter was not equipped, and was not required to be equipped, with a cockpit voice recorder or a flight data recorder. The helicopter was equipped with a Churchill navigation system, which is a recording device that allows airborne law enforcement vehicles to capture video and photographs from missions and augment the recordings with GPS data, including speed, heading, latitude and longitude position, and altitude. The last four videos on the system were examined as part of this investigation; no information relevant to the investigation was found. The last frame of the last video was recorded at 0128:23, about 35 minutes before the accident. &#x0D;\n - On May 2, 2020, about 0203 central daylight time, a MD 369E helicopter, N8375F, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Houston, Texas. The pilot sustained serious injuries, and the tactical flight officer sustained fatal injuries. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 public aircraft flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that, before the flight, he performed and completed a preflight examination of the helicopter, a review of the maintenance records, a check of the weather conditions, and a safety assessment. The pilot stated that no anomalies or concerns were found. About 0104, the helicopter departed from William P. Hobby Airport (HOU), Houston, Texas, and began a patrol flight over the city of Houston. The pilot noted that, when flying over a scene, his normal procedure was to make right turns to orbit the scene to provide the tactical flight officer with, and allow the forward-looking infrared camera to capture, the best view of the scene. The pilot also noted that he generally flew the helicopter at an airspeed of at least 30 knots while orbiting.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter had successfully flown over several scenes before it approached a scene near the accident location and began orbiting to the right. The helicopter was completing its second orbit when it began an uncommanded rotation to the right. The pilot recalled that, just before the helicopter began to rotate, he felt a “strong vibration” in the controls. The pilot did not recall the helicopter’s airspeed at the time, and he did not hear any unusual sounds or warning horns and did not see any caution or warning lights. According to the pilot, the helicopter was “spinning like [the] tail was not functioning,” and he responded by performing the emergency procedure for “loss of tail rotor.” He lowered the collective and pushed the cyclic forward “to gain forward airspeed and airflow over the vertical stabilizer.” The helicopter continued to spin “very violently” so he also reduced power. He was wearing night vision goggles and began searching for a suitable landing area and any potential obstructions. The pilot’s last memory of the event was maneuvering to avoid a building.&#x0D;\nAutomatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) showed that the helicopter approached the accident location just before 0200, slowed to a groundspeed between 40 and 60 knots, and descended to complete a right circling turn over the area at an altitude of 600 ft. One minute later, the helicopter began a right turn at an altitude of 500 ft. At 0202:20, the helicopter turned onto a southeasterly heading, and its groundspeed slowed to about 10 knots. At 0203:20, the helicopter began a tight right turn, and its groundspeed accelerated from 10 to 30 knots. The groundspeed remained at 30 knots for about 5 seconds before slowing to 20 knots. The right turn continued and tightened until 0203:39, and the helicopter flew straight for the final 5 seconds of flight. &#x0D;\nA video taken by a witness on the ground showed the helicopter spinning from 0203:35 to 0203:44. The helicopter then impacted an unoccupied building and terrain.&#x0D;\n - Toxicology testing performed by the FAA’s Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified ketamine and its metabolite norketamine in the tactical first officer’s femoral blood. Medical records showed that ketamine had been administered during the attempted resuscitation of the tactical first officer after the accident.&#x0D;\n - Evidence indicated that the pilot and the tactical flight officer were using three-point restraints at the time of impact. The pilot (in the left seat) was seriously injured as a result of compression spinal injuries and blunt force trauma injuries to his abdomen. The autopsy of the tactical flight officer (in the right seat) showed that his cause of death was multiple blunt force trauma, primarily to the abdomen. Both flight crewmembers wore flights helmets, but there was insufficient evidence to determine if the helmets reduced their head injuries. &#x0D;\n - The NTSB conducted an aircraft performance study for this accident. ADS-B data and nearby weather observation information were used to examine the helicopter’s performance. The data showed that the flight began from HOU about 0104 and lasted about 1 hour. During the flight, the helicopter’s altitude varied between 400 and 700 ft mean sea level, and its groundspeed ranged between 20 and 130 knots.&#x0D;\nThe witness video of the accident helicopter was also evaluated. Although the helicopter could be seen spinning from 0203:35 to 0203:44, the video did not record the beginning of the spin. The video study determined the yaw rate was increasing from 146° to 178° per second while the helicopter was visible. The helicopter’s yaw was to the right, opposite the rotation of the main rotor blades. The start of the yaw event could not be determined from the available video evidence. As previously noted, the pilot stated that he accelerated to try to gain control of the spinning helicopter. If the pilot’s statement corresponds with the increase in speed from 10 to 30 knots at 0203:20, the yaw would have begun before that time.&#x0D;\nThe performance study considered whether a loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) might have occurred during the accident sequence. LTE occurs when airflow through the tail rotor is altered such that there is no longer enough anti-torque thrust to keep the helicopter fuselage from yawing opposite the rotation of the main rotor blades. Helicopters with counterclockwise-rotating main rotor blades (such as the MD Helicopter 369) are at risk of LTE in low-speed flight when the wind is from the left or a tailwind exists. Between 0202:50 and 0203:20, the helicopter was on a track of about 137° and would have encountered the reported wind (4 knots from 170°) as a right quartering headwind of low magnitude. While on this track, the reported wind was not conductive to main rotor disc vortex interference LTE, weathercock stability LTE, or tail rotor vortex ring state LTE.&#x0D;\nThe study also considered whether a vortex ring state might have occurred. A vortex ring state describes an aerodynamic condition in which a helicopter may be in a vertical descent with 20% to up to maximum power applied yet little or no climb performance. A vortex ring state was not consistent with the helicopter’s apparent level flightpath at the likely onset of the spin, and a vortex ring state does not usually result in an uncontrolled spin.&#x0D;\nFAA Advisory Circular 90-95, Unanticipated Right Yaw in Helicopters, discusses a type of LTE referred to as a loss of translational lift, which is lift due to the helicopter’s forward motion. When a helicopter is at a speed below translational lift, more power is required for the helicopter to stay aloft, and the amount of anti-torque needed to maintain yaw control increases. Further, in slow forward flight, the air entering the tail rotor is disturbed by the main rotor and is less efficient. The transition to forward flight with translational lift typically occurs at a speed between 16 and 24 knots. During this transition, the anti-torque requirements change, and a pilot must make adjustments as needed. &#x0D;\nAs stated above, from 0202:50 to 0203:20, the helicopter was on a track of 137° with a 4-knot right quartering headwind. The helicopter’s 10- to 15-knot groundspeed at the time along with the headwind would have made the helicopter susceptible to changing lift and power conditions; thus, the required anti-torque would also change. Without sufficient anti-torque, an uncommanded right yaw could have resulted. &#x0D;\nIn addition, as the helicopter accelerates and translational lift increases, it induces a right rolling motion, and, according to the FAA’s Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21A), the helicopter pitches up. This pitch-up necessitates increased anti-torque and forward cyclic. Thus, if the helicopter experiences an uncommanded right yaw below the transition to translational lift, increasing power to increase speed could further contribute to the right yawing motion and need for anti-torque.&#x0D;\nThe performance study determined that the increased anti-torque requirement when below the onset of translational lift and right rolling moment induced by the introduction of translational lift when accelerating from low speed may have been factors contributing to the uncommanded right yaw event. However, without additional data about when the yaw event began, the helicopter’s attitude and power, or pilot inputs, it is not possible to determine the reason for the uncommanded right yaw.&#x0D;\n - The helicopter came to rest on its left side at the base of a building. The helicopter had initially impacted the roof of the building and subsequently fell to the ground. The wreckage area was compact with no significant debris trail and no evidence of a postcrash fire. All five main rotor blades were present at the accident site. The left skid tube was separated from the main fuselage, but the right skid remained attached. A longitudinal tear was observed along the skin and structure of the fuselage underside. The tailboom remained attached to the main fuselage, but the empennage (comprising the vertical fin, horizontal stabilizer, tail rotor gearbox, and tail rotor) was separated from the tailboom and came to rest on top of the right side of the helicopter near the engine bay. The tail rotor gearbox remained installed on the empennage, and both tail rotor blades remained attached to the tail rotor hub. A postaccident examination revealed no evidence of a preimpact failure of the helicopter structure, main rotor system, tail rotor system, cyclic and collective flight controls, or the engine. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter’s fractured tail rotor driveshaft was examined by the National Transportation Safety Board’s Material (NTSB’s) Laboratory. The driveshaft had fractured in the middle of the shaft and adjacent to a cylindrical support sheath. The fracture was perpendicular to the axis of the shaft and had fracture features consistent with torsional overstress with some bending.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Witnesses reported they observed the helicopter flying low with white smoke emitting from the rear rotor area. Suddenly, the tail rotor separated from the helicopter and landed in a dirt lot below. The helicopter continued northeast as it started to spin and impacted the ground.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the engine revealed no preimpact anomalies. The top of the vertical stabilizer, tail rotor assembly, tail rotor gearbox, input quill assembly, and mounting studs were examined. Progressive crack growth was noted on the mounting studs within the tail rotor gearbox housing. The fracture surfaces were relatively rough, consistent with low-cycle fatigue or cyclic overstress crack growth under relatively high cyclic stresses. Additionally, multiple layers of primer, paint, and sealant were observed on the input quill assembly, including paint on the flange clamping surface where it had mated to the vertical stabilizer. Paint was also observed on the vertical stabilizer support casting where it had mated to the input quill as well as the washers for the tail rotor gearbox attachment hardware. In 2012, the gearbox was removed from another helicopter, repaired, painted, and installed on the accident helicopter. There was no other information regarding the installation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn January 2019, the helicopter was painted and photographs that were taken during this process indicated that the tail boom, tail rotor gearbox, and tail rotor assembly remained installed during the painting process. In addition, the tail rotor assembly and tail rotor gearbox were masked. Therefore, the paint found on the contact mounting surfaces was likely applied during the gearbox installation in 2012; however, the maintenance logs did not provide detailed information of the painting process.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn April 2019, the tail rotor gearbox was removed from the vertical stabilizer for a corrosion inspection; no defects were noted in the maintenance logs. A retorque and/or torque stabilization check was not completed after the gearbox was installed, nor was it required to be according to applicable technical manuals.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe presence of paint on the contact surfaces between the tail rotor gearbox and vertical stabilizer can lead to excessive relaxation of clamping forces due to compressive creep deformation of the paint. Therefore, the improper application of paint on the contact surfaces, which would have been disturbed during the last tail rotor gearbox removal about 39 flight hours prior to the accident, was likely a factor in the eventual reduction in clamping force of the tail rotor gearbox installation onto the vertical stabilizer. However, improper torque of the retaining nuts would also affect the clamping force between the tail rotor gearbox and the vertical stabilizer, but it could not be determined if the retaining nuts were properly torqued during the tail rotor gearbox’s reinstallation after the corrosion inspection in April 2019.  The reduction in clamping force on the installation led to the initiation of fatigue fractures on the attachment studs and subsequent separation of the tail rotor gearbox from the vertical stabilizer in flight. The separation of the tail rotor gearbox resulted in a loss of directional control of the helicopter. Had a retorque and/or torque stabilization check of the gearbox retaining nuts been required, it could have identified the reduction in clamping force of the tail rotor gearbox’s installation onto the vertical stabilizer prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe detected levels of oxycodone and its psychoactive metabolite oxymorphone in the pilot’s specimen are most consistent with some degree of tolerance to the effects of oxycodone, indicating regular use. Although it is likely that the pilot was impaired to some degree by the effects of oxycodone at the time of the accident, pilot impairment is unlikely to have contributed to the accident circumstances given that the tail rotor assembly separated in flight. &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to aircraft records, the accident helicopter’s tail rotor gearbox (also known as the 90-degree gearbox) was removed from a different helicopter in September 2012 due to failing serviceability checks caused by metal accumulation. In November 2012, it was repaired by replacing the main input seal, painted, and installed onto the accident helicopter, about 228 flight hours prior to the accident. There was no other information regarding this installation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn January 2019, the helicopter’s tail boom, upper portion of the vertical stabilizer, and elevators were painted. Photographs from this painting activity showed that the tail boom, tail rotor gearbox, and tail rotor assembly remained installed during the painting process. The tail rotor assembly and tail rotor gearbox were masked during the painting process. The fuselage and lower tail boom were painted a white color, and the upper portion of the tail boom was painted black. The vertical stabilizer was painted black on the upper and lower portions, with a blue stripe in the middle. The elevators were removed from the tail boom and painted separately; they were painted a blue color. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn April 2019, about 39 flight hours prior to the accident, the tail rotor gearbox was removed from the vertical stabilizer for a corrosion inspection; no defects were noted in the maintenance logs.  The United States Army technical manuals, cited by the type certificate holder for maintenance of this helicopter, do not require a retorque and/or torque stabilization check of gearbox retaining nuts a certain number of flight hours after installation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn December 2019, about 7 hours prior to the accident, oil was drained from the tail rotor gearbox due to discoloration and samples were sent for oil analysis. The oil analysis report indicated abnormal copper and aluminum wear particles within the tail rotor gearbox oil. While no corrective action was recommended at that time, a resample was recommended at the next service interval. The accident occurred before the next oil sample was taken.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n - On April 24, 2020, about 1600 mountain standard time, a Bell UH-1H helicopter, N3276T, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident in Mesa, Arizona. The pilot was fatally injured, and the second pilot was seriously injured. The helicopter operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 relocation flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe surviving pilot stated he does not recall the accident sequence. Witnesses reported they observed the helicopter flying low toward Falcon Field Airport (FFZ), Mesa, Arizona, with white smoke emitting from the tail rotor area. Suddenly, the tail rotor separated from the helicopter and landed in a dirt lot below. The helicopter continued northeast as it started to spin and impacted the ground.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight track indicated that the helicopter took off from Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport (TRM), Palm Springs, California, about 1324 Pacific daylight time and turned eastbound seemingly along Interstate I-10 toward the Phoenix area. The flight track was intermittent due to the helicopter going in and out of coverage for about 2 hours before passing just north of Buckeye Municipal Airport (BXK) Buckeye, Arizona. The helicopter then turned right and tracked southeast for about 10 minutes and turned left traveling east over a mountain chain and continuing until reaching Stellar Airpark (P19), Chandler, Arizona. The helicopter performed one left hand 360° turn just west of the field before continuing across the airport and turning northeast directly toward FFZ. The helicopter continued along that heading until just before crossing Highway 60 when it began to simultaneously descend and lose ground speed. After crossing the highway, it entered a right descending turn until track data were lost about 1556. &#x0D;\n - Toxicology testing on the deceased pilot performed by NMS Labs at the request of the Maricopa County Medical Examiner identified oxycodone at 140 ng/ml and its psychoactive metabolite oxymorphone at 10 ng/ml in femoral blood. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOxycodone is an opioid pain medication available by prescription as a Schedule II controlled substance (high potential for addiction and abuse). It is often sold as a combination product with acetaminophen (Tylenol) under the names Percocet, Roxicet, and Endocet. When sold as a solo drug, the most common name is Oxycontin. In all these forms, it carries a boxed warning about the potential for addiction, abuse, and misuse, and a specific warning that the drug, “may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery. Warn patients not to drive or operate dangerous machinery unless they are tolerant to the effects of oxycodone and acetaminophen tables and know how they will react to the medication.” In novice users, usual drug levels where desired effects are likely but toxic effects are unlikely are between 13 and 99 ng/ml. However, with regular use, patients become tolerated to the effects and may appear to be functioning at much higher blood levels. &#x0D;\nIn 2013, a FAA hotline complaint was filed against the pilot. He was evaluated by an FAA consultant and diagnosed with cocaine and alcohol dependance, both in remission since November 11, 2014. In 2015, the pilot was evaluated and placed in the Human Intervention Motivational Study program to continue his recovery from alcohol and cocaine addiction. With continued evaluation and treatment, the pilot eventually obtained a special issuance first class medical certificate in December 2016. He remained in this program, which requires periodic evaluations and drug testing, until October 29, 2019. During the pilot’s last medical on December 16, 2019, he reported no other chronic conditions and only reported the use of sildenafil (Viagra).&#x0D;\n - On scene examination by a Federal Aviation Administration inspector indicated that the debris field was about 1/2 mile long, extending along a generally northeast direction. The first identified pieces of debris were fragments of glass, which were consistent with a vertical stabilizer navigation light. About 200 yards further northeast were the tail rotor assembly and the input quill assembly.  The rest of the helicopter came to rest about ½ mile further northeast in an open, slightly sloped field. The first pieces of debris in the field were the vertical stabilizer and a large portion of the right elevator. Next were two long and narrow ground strikes, consistent with main rotor blade strikes. Immediately following this area was the main wreckage; the helicopter came to rest slightly nose- and left-side low, along a heading of about 49°. The helicopter exhibited upward crushing throughout the cabin and fuselage, most extensively on the left side of the fuselage. The mast and the main transmission were displaced forward and to the left. The main rotor assembly was fracture separated and located about 20 yards northeast of the main wreckage; it was the last major piece of debris. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter’s engine did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Flight control continuity was mostly established throughout the airframe; some areas were inaccessible due to airframe deformation. The tail boom had been removed for recovery purposes. The vertical stabilizer was fracture-separated, consistent with main rotor blade impact. The tail rotor gearbox was fracture-separated at the attachment studs, and four of the fractured attachment stud pieces were found loose within the vertical stabilizer. A fifth stud piece remained stuck in the vertical stabilizer support casting, and the nut end of the sixth stud piece was not located. The chip detector was removed from the tail rotor gearbox and metallic debris was present. The tail rotor assembly was mostly whole and intact. The linkages and tail rotor blades remained secured in place. The tail rotor blades were damaged at the leading edges near the blade tips and had multiple dents along the span of the blades. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe top of the vertical stabilizer, tail rotor assembly, tail rotor gearbox, input quill assembly, and mounting studs were all packaged and sent to the National Transportation Safety Board materials laboratory for further examination. Progressive crack growth was noted on the mounting studs within the tail rotor gearbox housing. The fracture surfaces were relatively rough, consistent with low-cycle fatigue or cyclic overstress crack growth under relatively high cyclic stresses. Additionally, multiple layers of primer, paint, and sealant were observed on the input quill assembly, including beige-tinted white paint on the flange clamping surface where it had mated to the vertical stabilizer. Beige-tinted white paint was also observed on the vertical stabilizer support casting where it had mated to the input quill as well as the washers for the tail rotor gearbox attachment hardware. &#x0D;\nThe United States Army Depot Maintenance Work Requirement No. 55-1560-127 contains instructions for painting the tail rotor gearbox. The instructions contain a step to “mask the top part of the outer flange of input quill sleeve and also the entire studs.”  &#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and passenger were conducting a low-altitude raptor survey flight. Witnesses reported seeing the helicopter flying just prior to its impact with powerlines about 85 ft above the ground. The witnesses described the helicopter in a gentle turn toward the sun prior to impact. One witness noted that he did not hear any unusual noises from the helicopter prior to impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutomatic dependent surveillance-broadcast data from the helicopter provided information indicating the pilot flew six flights in the 24 hours prior to the accident. The accident flight was the fifth that day and occurred approximately 10 hours after the pilot had begun flying that morning. Intervals between flights that day were 17, 24, 35, and 29 minutes.  &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThese working conditions were conducive to fatigue. Research on pilot fatigue in a noisy, vibrating helicopter simulator found considerable increases in subjective fatigue after 6 hours of short repetitive flights. At the end of this period, some helicopter pilots who participated in the study said they were so fatigued that they did not feel safe to fly a real helicopter. As subjective fatigue increased, study pilots demonstrated increasingly frequent “lapses” in performance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhile missions the day of the accident were longer than those in the study, flights were conducted at low altitude and involved repetitive observation tasks that required a high state of awareness to avoid terrain and obstacles. This heightened state of awareness would produce a mental workload similar to the shorter repetitive IFR flights in the study; therefore, it is likely that similar effects would be expected, including lapses in performance as fatigue increased. These lapses in performance were described in the study as outliers caused by moments of inattention. The accident pilot’s ability to avoid the same wire nine times earlier that day, but not avoid it during the accident flight is consistent with an attentional “lapse.” This potential lapse combined with over 10 hours since awakening, and 8 hours flight time already accumulated the day of the accident suggests that the pilot was likely fatigued during the accident flight and that fatigue likely challenged the pilot’s ability to see and avoid the power line.  &#x0D;\n  &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "On March 31, 2020, about 1626 central daylight time, a Robinson R44 helicopter, N107EH, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Audubon, Iowa. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 aerial observation flight.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the purpose of the flight was to conduct a raptor survey of a 442 square-mile area in western Iowa under contract with another company whose biologist was the passenger on the helicopter at the time of the accident. The helicopter was flying a north-south grid pattern when two witnesses observed the helicopter flying in a southerly direction at low altitude. One witness observed the helicopter strike the bottom two wires of a power line before it impacted terrain and burst into flames. The second witness lost sight of the helicopter just before it impacted the wires but heard the impact and observed the helicopter descend with wires intertwined in the main rotor. Both witnesses thought the helicopter was in a turn to the southwest, toward the sun, prior to the hitting the wires. One witness described the helicopter in a gentle turn, not in a way that looked like the pilot was aware of the high lines. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutomatic dependent surveillance- broadcast (ADS-B) data showed that during the final moments of the accident flight, the helicopter was travelling south over Robin Avenue, approaching 240th Street, at an ADS-B-reported geometric altitude of 1,475 ft, with a ground speed of about 85 kts. The final recorded data point was about 160 ft north of the wires that were struck. There were no deviations in heading or altitude before the end of the data. The ground elevation at the accident site was about 1,460 ft. The flights within the survey area were conducted at altitudes about 100 ft above the ground. Examination of the flight track data for the previous flight showed that the helicopter had crossed the power lines on at least two occasions during the previous flight. (See Figure 1.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on ADS-B flight data and the pilot’s flight records, he had flown a flight the night prior to the accident that concluded in the Sioux Falls, South Dakota, area, lasted about 45 minutes, and was followed by about 9 hours of non-flight activity. It is not known what the pilot did during this time of non-flight activity. On the day of the accident the pilot flew five flights lasting 51 minutes, 18 minutes, 3 hours 29 minutes, 3 hours 11 minutes, and 22 minutes, respectively. The first flight of the day took off at 0629. Between these flights were periods of non-flight activity lasting 17 minutes, 24 minutes, 35 minutes and 29 minutes, respectively. It was reported that the biologist joined the flight after the helicopter arrived at Arthur N. Neu Airport (CIN), Carroll, Iowa, after the second flight of the day.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Plot of the survey area and the helicopter flight path on the day of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2: 3-dimensional view of the final portion of the accident flight path.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n - The helicopter came to rest in a field next to the west side of Robin Avenue and south of 240th Street. The wires that were struck ran along the north edge of 240th Street, strung between poles that were about 100 ft. tall. The estimated height of the wires struck was about 85 ft. above the ground. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was flying his single-seat, experimental amateur-built helicopter over his private grass runway. There were no witnesses to the accident. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no anomalies, and damage to the main and tail rotor blades and drive systems, as well as recorded data, were consistent with the engine producing power at the time of impact. No autopsy or toxicological testing were performed on the pilot due to medical care received following the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFamily members stated that the pilot would often practice hovering and taxiing over the runway. The pilot had reported to family members that he had experienced a couple of hard landings during previous flights and that he would often revert to his fixed-wing habits and push the cyclic forward when he encountered trouble flying the helicopter. Although he had received about 12 hours of flight instruction in a helicopter of a different make/model and had logged about 10 hours of solo flight experience in the accident helicopter, the pilot had not received an endorsement for solo flight in a helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter wreckage found no preimpact anomalies to explain why the helicopter impacted terrain and no determination could be made whether the pilot experienced a medical event. The extent to which the pilot’s lack of training and experience in helicopters may have contributed to the accident could not be determined. The accident is consistent with the pilot’s loss of control of the helicopter for reasons that could not be determined based on the available information.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "The Assembly and Operating/Maintenance Manual for the Composite FX XE-285 helicopter stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough it is light and small, the Composite FX aircraft is a real helicopter in every sense, with controls, drive, rotor systems and capabilities all similar to its bigger companions. It therefore requires the same amount of respect and consideration for safety and integrity required of a larger helicopter. In order to fly the Composite FX helicopter, pilots must receive proper training.  It is strongly recommended that pilots be fully trained to private pilot status in a small training helicopter such as a Robinson R-22. Training to student pilot status is considered the minimum acceptable amount of training required.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTo be flown as an experimental aircraft the pilot must possess a private pilot’s license. The aircraft must be registered with the FAA (“N” numbered) and pass an airworthiness inspection by a Designated Airworthiness Representative, (DAR), prior to the first flight.&#x0D;\n - No aircraft maintenance logbooks were located during the investigation. A single record of repairs conducted by Composite FX dated February 15, 2020, was located. The record indicated that the repairs were necessary following a hard landing.&#x0D;\n - On February 23, 2020, about 1808 eastern standard time, an experimental, amateur-built XE285 helicopter, N840GS, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near North Manchester, Indiana. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne witness reported that he saw the helicopter flying from a distance about 30 minutes before the accident. He did not know if the helicopter was over the airstrip or a nearby field but that the helicopter appeared to be hovering.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFamily members of the pilot reported that the pilot had purchased the helicopter about 3 years before the accident. The pilot had received some flight instruction in a helicopter but had limited his flights in the accident helicopter to practicing hovering, taxiing, and landings at their airstrip. They stated that the pilot had previously experienced two hard landings in the accident helicopter. They did not witness the accident flight but believed that the pilot was performing those same maneuvers at the time of the accident. The pilot had previously told the family members that he had difficulty overcoming his habits from flying airplanes and would sometimes push the cyclic forward when he had trouble flying the helicopter. &#x0D;\n - The pilot initially survived the accident and received medical treatment. As a result of medical procedures performed on the pilot following the accident, neither toxicology testing nor an autopsy was conducted.&#x0D;\n  &#x0D;\n - The pilot held a private-pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. According to his logbook, he had accumulated about 22 total hours of helicopter experience in the 3 years before the accident, 12.6 hours of which were instructional flights in an Enstrom 280FX helicopter; 9.4 hours were logged as pilot-in-command (solo) in the accident helicopter. The pilot had not received an endorsement for solo flight in a helicopter. The pilot annotated “hover and taxiing” next to each logbook entry for flights in the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n - The accident site was located on the east end of a private grass airstrip located about 3 miles west of North Manchester, Indiana. The helicopter came to rest on its right side. Both aluminum main rotor blades (MRB) remained attached to the rotor mast. One MRB was partially embedded into the ground and displayed some bending and deformation along its entire length. The second MRB was bent about 70° and exhibited deformation throughout its length. Two impact marks, one of which was linear, were located on the ground within 3 ft of the nose of the helicopter. (see figure 1.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Accident Site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fiberglass tail boom was separated from the fuselage but was retained by the anti-torque control cable. The tail rotor assembly remained attached to the tail boom. One aluminum tail rotor blade (TRB) was mostly straight. The second TRB was separated from the tail rotor gearbox about 3 inches outboard of the TRB attachment point on the TRB assembly and was located immediately below the TRB assembly in the wreckage. The separation was consistent with impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was continuous from the cyclic and the collective to the swash plate assembly.  The main rotor mast was folded forward into the cabin area. The two control rods immediately above the swash plate assembly were fractured in a manner consistent with impact. Continuity continued from the breaks in the control rods above the swash plate through the rotor mast to the main rotor blades.  The anti-torque pedal control cables were intact from the pedals to the tail rotor assembly. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThrottle continuity was verified from the collective to the dual carburetor assembly, and liquid consistent with automotive gasoline was found in both the main and reserve fuel tanks. The liquid was clear of contaminants and water when visually examined. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine continuity was verified by rotating the radiator fan and observing both pistons move in each respective cylinder and observing the output shaft on top of the engine rotate.  Engine compression was verified on each cylinder. The hour meter displayed 22:06 at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination did not reveal any pre-impact anomalies with the airframe or engine. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo MGL Avionics Stratomaster Velocity engine monitors and a Dynojet Power Commander V module were recovered and subsequently downloaded. Data recovered from each unit was consistent with the engine producing power at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter pilot was conducting a night cross-country flight in visual meteorological conditions. Recorded data showed that while the helicopter was flying at an altitude of about 2,300 ft mean sea level and at an indicated airspeed of about 107 knots, slight pitch and roll oscillations occurred for about 20 seconds followed by a left roll that continued until the helicopter was inverted. A main rotor blade contacted the tailboom, leading to an in-flight breakup over a residential area. Postaccident examination of the airframe, flight controls, and engine assembly revealed no evidence of a preimpact failure or malfunction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBecause the helicopter’s pitch and roll values changed only minimally before the in-flight upset, the autopilot was likely engaged when the pitch and roll oscillations started. The pitch and roll oscillations might have been the result of the autopilot reacting to an external disturbance, specifically, the moderate&#x1E;to&#x1E;severe turbulence that was reported in the area. Another possible cause of the pitch and roll oscillations was the pilot manually manipulating the cyclic control. Additionally, an in-flight malfunction of the autopilot’s roll servo actuator could not be ruled out as the source for the pitch and roll oscillations. While any of these scenarios might have precipitated the initial oscillations, none would have precluded the pilot from overriding the autopilot and manually flying the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEven though the helicopter was equipped with devices that recorded flight and engine data at a rate of at least one parameter every second, the lack of an on-board crash-resistant cockpit imaging system precluded a determination of the pilot’s actions, or lack of actions, in response to the pitch and roll oscillations. About 6 months after this accident, the National Transportation Safety Board issued a safety recommendation requesting that major helicopter manufacturers, including the manufacturer of the accident helicopter, install crash-resistant flight recorders with cockpit imaging systems for existing helicopters. The helicopter manufacturer responded that it incorporated a cockpit camera system as standard equipment on all similar model helicopters manufactured beginning the year after the accident and offered as a kit for existing helicopters the same year. The cameras were not designed to be crash-resistant.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe pilot was not likely impaired or incapacitated by his diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea given the information about his effective continuous positive airway pressure device use. Also, some or all the ethanol detected in the pilot’s specimens might have been from a source other than ingestion. The possibility of an impairing or incapacitating medical event or impairing effects from the pilot’s use of clonazepam (alone or in combination with ethanol effects) could not be determined from the available evidence. However, no operational evidence indicated that the pilot’s performance was deficient during the flight time preceding the oscillations.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Video Study&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB conducted a video study using a 22.8-second doorbell camera video. The helicopter became visible in the video at 8.5 seconds and was last seen in the video at 15.3 seconds. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe study analyzed the first 19 seconds of audio recorded by the doorbell camera video. The study revealed the pattern of spectral peaks generated by the interaction of the tail rotor and main rotor wake were present through the first 12 seconds of the video, indicating that both main and tail rotors were operating at their normal rotational speeds through that time. After that time, the contribution of the main rotor to the sound spectrum was no longer present. The study also showed that, between 11 and 13 seconds into the video, a large signal level was recorded. The study determined that the large signal level was likely due to the separation of the main rotor from the airframe and was the transient event that significantly changed the spectral characteristics of the engine sound. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPersonal Electronic Devices&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo iPhones were found at the accident site were sent to the NTSB’s Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC. The laboratory found that the pilot’s last incoming phone call was received at 2008:18, about 11 minutes before the accident, and lasted 2 minutes 53 seconds. The pilot’s last sent text message was at 2010:20, and his last incoming text message was read at 2010:28. The pilot’s cellular phone had navigation and weather applications running in the background, but the contents of those applications could not be decoded.  No data pertinent to the accident were found on the passenger’s phone.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrevious Related Recommendation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped, and was not required to be equipped, with a flight data recorder or a cockpit voice recorder. The NTSB recommended in June 2020 to international and domestic helicopter manufacturer’s, including Robinson Helicopter Company, to install on existing turbine-powered helicopters that are not equipped with a flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder a means to install a crash-resistant flight recorder system that records cockpit audio and images with a view of the cockpit environment to include as much of the outside view as possible and parametric data per aircraft and installation. Robinson responded that it incorporated a cockpit camera system as standard equipment on all R66 helicopters manufactured beginning in 2021 and offered as a kit for existing helicopters that same year. The camera system was not crash-resistant.&#x0D;\n - The helicopter was manufactured in January 2019 and was purchased shortly afterward by a company associated with the pilot. At the time of the accident, the hour meter indicated about 167 hours. The helicopter was equipped with a semirigid rotor system that rotated counterclockwise (when viewed from above). According to Robinson Safety Notice (SN) 11, Low-G Pushovers – Extremely Dangerous, pushing the cyclic forward following a pull-up or rapid climb, or even from level flight produces a low-G (weightless) flight condition. The notice goes on to state that if forward cyclic is applied, the main rotor torque reaction will then combine with tail rotor thrust to produce a powerful right rolling momement of the fuselage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a Genesys Aerosystems HeliSAS two-axis autopilot system comprised of a flight control computer, HeliSAS control panel, and two servo-actuators (one each for the pitch and roll axes). The autopilot system was designed to record faults in the system. The downloaded data were unrecognizable by the manufacturer; therefore, no accident-related data were available from the HeliSAS.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the R66 Pilot’s Operating Handbook Supplement for the HeliSAS, &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe primary autopilot mode is stability augmentation system (SAS) mode which maintains a steady helicopter attitude by applying corrective inputs to the cyclic. The autopilot does not provide any collective or pedal inputs. Additional modes providing heading hold, altitude hold, and navigation functionality are also selectable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe SAS mode of the autopilot was engaged by pressing either the SAS button on the control panel or the trim button mounted on the cyclic for more than 1.25 seconds. With the SAS mode engaged, the pilot can “fly through” the SAS to achieve a desired attitude and can subsequently press and release the trim button to reset the baseline attitude for the system to the current attitude. Pushing the SAS button on the control panel or the “AP [autopilot] OFF” button on the cyclic disengages the SAS mode (for manual control), and four aural beeps would sound in the pilot’s headset. Additionally, the HeliSAS is designed to automatically disengage when one of several predefined faults or malfunctions is detected, which would also produce four aural beeps in the pilot’s headset. Disengagement of an autopilot mode, such as heading or navigation, not commanded by the pilot (caused by, for example, the loss of a valid navigation signal) would be accompanied by a single beep in the pilot’s headset. Any intentional disengagement of an autopilot mode other than SAS would not trigger a beep sound in the pilot’s headset (because SAS mode would remain engaged).&#x0D;\n - On January 9, 2020, about 2029 eastern standard time, a Robinson R66, N450MC, was destroyed after it was involved in an accident near Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. The private pilot and the passenger were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a chronological summary of flight communications prepared by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), about 1954, the pilot contacted ground control at Martin State Airport (MTN), Baltimore, Maryland, and requested visual flight rules (VFR) flight following to Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF), Buffalo, New York, at 3,000 ft mean sea level (msl). About 1957, the pilot contacted local control at MTN and advised that the flight was ready to depart, and was then approved to do so. About 1959, the pilot was instructed to contact Potomac Approach Control.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data and a transcription of audio communications, the helicopter climbed to about 2,300 ft msl and proceeded on a north-northwesterly track. The helicopter remained at that altitude and on that track from about 2002 to 2023, during which time the pilot made initial contact with the Harrisburg approach sector. At 2023:15, the controller instructed the pilot to fly along a heading of 310°, and the helicopter turned to a northwest heading, consistent with the instruction. The helicopter’s altitude remained about the same until 2028:50, at which time the helicopter began descending. About 2029, radar contact with the helicopter was lost, and the controller attempted to contact the pilot but received no response. Also about 2029, the Harrisburg approach radio frequency recorded a “grunt-type sound” from an unidentified source. The last radar target, at 2029:17, showed that the helicopter was at an altitude of about 1,150 ft msl. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a Garmin GTN 750, a Garmin GDU 1060, and an engine monitoring unit (EMU), which recorded data at a rate of at least one sample per second. The synchronized downloaded data from the devices depicted that the final portion of the flight contained no pitch or roll excursions, nor any significant heading changes until about 2028:46 (which was 29 seconds before the end of the GDU 1060-recorded data and 32 seconds before the end of the EMU-recorded data). Immediately before that time, pitch was steady at -3°, roll was steady at near-zero values, and the engine’s torque was about 58%. From 2028:46 to 2029:05, the helicopter’s pitch began to oscillate slightly and eventually reached -12°, and the helicopter began to roll to the left with an increasing rate, reaching about 8 to 10° between 2029:03 and 2029:05. After 2029:05, the left roll continued to increase quickly (within about 5 to 7 seconds); during the rapid left roll, the engine torque spiked briefly and then decreased. At 2029:06, the normal acceleration parameter trended negatively during the next 3 seconds, reaching -1 G. &#x0D;\nBetween 2028:07 and 2029:07, the average indicated airspeed was about 107 knots. During the same timeframe, the average recorded G loading was -0.035, with the G loading decreasing afterward to -1 with the corresponding left roll. One second later, at 2029:08, the indicated airspeed was zero.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2029:10, the helicopter’s left roll was about 119°, pitch was -8°, and engine torque was about 30%; 1 second later, the helicopter was in a left roll of 179° and a -23° pitch, and the engine torque increased to 64%. This time corresponded with the grunt sound that was recorded by the Harrisburg air traffic control facility. Between 2029:11 and 2029:12, the helicopter’s pitch decreased to -46°, the torque decreased to about 35%, the power turbine speed (N2) increased from 98% to 101%, and the left roll continued past 180° (inverted) to 114° to the right. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2029:13, the helicopter’s pitch was -58°, roll was 126° right, N2 was about 99%, and torque was about 32%. One second later, the helicopter’s pitch was -36°, N2 was about 75%, and torque was at about 13%. At 2029:15, the helicopter’s N2 was about 128% (overspeed), and the torque was about 1%. The last ADS-B target about 2029:17 depicted the helicopter being at about 1,150 ft msl. At 2029:18, the compressor speed, N2, and torque values were 72%, 111%, and less than zero, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was outside and located about 986 ft east of the accident site, reported hearing and seeing a low-flying helicopter that was “struggling to fly.” The witness reported hearing a high-pitched noise that sounded as if the rotor was having difficulty turning, and then she heard a loud “boom” and saw a flash of light. At that point, the helicopter disappeared from her view.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother witness who was in his house located about 800 ft northeast of the accident site reported hearing a “thumping” sound that slowed. The witness then heard a loud “bang,” which shook his house. The witness also reported hearing a “percussion” sound before the sound of impact. His house had a doorbell video camera that also recorded audio; the video camera was provided to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) for examination. (See the Video Study section of this report for further information.)&#x0D;\n - An autopsy of the pilot was performed by Forensic Pathology, Cumberland County Coroner's Office&#x0D;\n - According to the NTSB’s weather study, at the helicopter’s cruising altitude of about 2,300 ft, the wind was from about 190° at 27 knots. At that altitude, there was an 87% probability of moderate-to-severe turbulence. The study also indicated that pilot reports confirmed strong&#x1E;to&#x1E;severe low&#x1E;level windshear and moderate&#x1E;to&#x1E;severe turbulence between 2,300 and 3,000 ft over the accident area during the overnight and early morning hours. The Robinson Helicopter Pilot’s Operating Handbook and the FAA&#x1E;approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual recommended an indicated airspeed range between 60 and 70 knots during significant turbulence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest National Weather Service Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler radar over the region showed no precipitation echoes along the flightpath or the accident site during the time surrounding the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident the Sun had already set, and the Moon was approximately 49° above the horizon at an azimuth of 95° and was 99% illuminated.&#x0D;\n - During 2001 and 2009, the pilot was diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea and coronary artery disease, respectively. According to documentation provided to the FAA, cardiac catheterization had shown mild-to-moderate triple-vessel coronary artery disease that did not require stenting or surgery, and the pilot did not have any typical symptoms of related heart pain or congestive heart failure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMedical records from the pilot’s most recent visit to his primary care provider on November 27, 2019, showed that the pilot was using a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device to treat his sleep apnea with good adherence and symptom control. The records also showed that the pilot was not adhering to treatment for high blood pressure but that he had no cardiovascular symptoms and a blood pressure of that was slightly higher than his goal. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the year preceding the accident, the pilot used his CPAP 85% of the time with an average use of 8 hours 6 minutes. During the 7 days preceding the accident, the pilot used his CPAP every night with an average use of 7 hours 38 minutes per night and 8 hours 6 minutes of use on the night before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to records provided by Robinson Helicopter Company, the pilot attended a safety course in February 2019 for the R66. At that time, the pilot had not accumulated any hours in the R66. On the evaluation document, the instructor indicated that the pilot had “very good control” of the helicopter when performing normal and emergency procedures and that he was “very comfortable practicing the [autorotations].” The instructor suggested that the pilot obtain more training on emergency procedures. The pilot was rated “average” on all demonstrated maneuvers.&#x0D;\n - The helicopter crashed in a residential area that was located about 61 miles north-northwest of MTN. The main wreckage area, consisting of the fuselage, was located in the backyard of a residence. The fuselage was nearly inverted and was resting on its right side along a magnetic heading of 334°. The fuselage structure was not damaged, but the windshield bow had extensive impact damage. The bow retained its shape but was fractured at the roofline, and the windshield had fractured. Sections of windshield pieces remained attached to the bow.  A portion of the tailboom was located about 30 to 40 ft above ground level in a tree next to the fuselage resting location. A ground scar about 10 inches deep was located about 30 ft from the nose resting position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWreckage consisting of a section of a main rotor blade, the main rotor mast with attached sections of a main rotor blade, the tail rotor, the tail rotor control tubes, airframe structural tubes, and plexiglass were found away from the main wreckage, with the farthest located about 700 ft away. No evidence of pre- or postimpact fire was found on any portion of the wreckage. No bird remains or feathers were found in the main wreckage consisting of the fuselage, or in locations of the separated main rotor mast and tail rotor gearbox.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA main rotor blade section that was about 5 ft long was located on the ground near the trunk of a small tree in the front yard of a residence; the blade section was located about 700 ft and 161° from the main wreckage. The leading edge of the blade was embedded into the ground, and the trailing edge of the blade was curved and exhibited red and black paint transfer on the upper surface near the fracture surface. Several feathers were found on the ground adjacent to the blade and near the tree, and several feathers were found adhered to the blade. The feathers and swabs of debris that had adhered to the separated portion of the main rotor blade were analyzed by the Smithsonian Institution’s Feather Identification Lab. The feathers were matched to museum specimens of a mourning dove, and the swabs of debris did not contain bird remains.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the tail rotor drive, tail rotor flight controls, and main rotor flight controls revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. Examination of the tailboom, which consisted of 7 bays, revealed damage to several of the bays. A horizontal dent was noted on the left side to the lower surface of bays 5, 6, and 7; the dent was consistent with contact with the leading edge of the blue main rotor blade. The rivet spacing of the tailboom in that area matched the indentations made in the blue main rotor blade. The tailboom was fractured at the aft bulkhead (bay 7). Yellow paint transfer was noted between bays 6 and 7 on the bottom. Slight paint transfer was noted on the left side of bay 4. An impact area (which had partially ruptured and was flattened) was noted on the left and lower side of bay 3. Bays 2 and 3 exhibited red, black, and yellow paint transfer on the left side.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that all engine mounts were fractured in a manner consistent with overload. The engine-to-transmission shaft was fractured on both ends, and the shaft tube was found within the wreckage. This shaft’s forward flange remained attached to the forward flex plate and main gearbox input yoke, and its aft flange remained attached to the aft flex plate and sprag clutch. All fractures on the shaft had signatures consistent with overstress failure. The engine bay cowling was crushed tightly around the engine, consistent with impact in a tail-low inverted attitude. All engine control fittings (including pneumatic, electronic, and oil lines; B&#x1E;nuts; clamps; and associated hardware) were checked by hand and found to be at least hand tight. All B-nuts were marked with blue and/or white torque paint. The engine and its systems showed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe sprag clutch remained installed onto the engine accessory gearbox. The clutch was operationally checked by hand and performed satisfactorily. The clutch was also examined using computed tomography and was then partially disassembled and examined at the NTSB’s Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC. Both examinations revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor mast and the upper portion of the main gearbox housing were found&#x0D;\nseparated from the main wreckage. Examination of the fracture surfaces on the main rotor gearbox housing showed no evidence of progressive cracking.&#x0D;\nComponents of the autopilot system were removed from the helicopter and operationally tested at the manufacturer’s facility. Both the flight control computer and the HeliSAS control panel functioned normally. Operational testing of the pitch servo actuator could not be performed likely due to a damaged wire within a wire bundle leading to the motor. The pitch servo actuator was then disassembled and examined, which revealed that the shrink-wrapped wire bundle sleeve was partially dislodged from the motor housing, exposing some of the wires, one of which was cut. Surface corrosion was noted on the magnet and friction plate. &#x0D;\nThe roll servo actuator passed the resolver test and the acceptance test protocol. The roll servo actuator was connected to an exemplar flight control computer and HeliSAS control panel but failed the system-level test, which included driving the servo clockwise and counterclockwise as well as manually back-driving the servo clockwise and counterclockwise. No obvious visible damage was observed on the servo actuator motor’s wire bundle, but internal damage to the wires could have resulted in a failure of the system-level test. The autopilot manufacturer did not have the capability to perform electrical testing of the roll servo actuator motor and its wire bundle.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "According to the flight nurse and paramedic, the flight was normal until the helicopter suddenly rolled to the left as they approached the helipad during landing. The pilot made no attempt to correct the roll, and the helicopter rolled onto its side and the main rotors contacted the ground. The pilot was immediately observed to be unresponsive and not breathing, and the flight nurse and paramedic began CPR as quickly as they could extricate the pilot from the cockpit. &#x0D;\nAutopsy of the pilot revealed severe coronary artery disease that placed him at significant increased risk for sudden death from an acute coronary event. Given the pilot's sudden inability to pilot the helicopter safely, the recognition by certified medical personnel that he was unresponsive and not breathing immediately following the accident, and the fact that he did not suffer enough blunt force trauma to have caused immediate cardiac arrest, it is most likely that the accident occurred because the pilot became incapacitated from an acute cardiac event. &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "On December 25, 2019, about 1713 central standard time, a Bell 407 helicopter, N663SF, sustained substantial damage when it was involved in an accident near Headland, Alabama. The commercial pilot was fatally injured, and the flight nurse and paramedic were not injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 air ambulance flight. &#x0D;\nAccording to the flight nurse, who was seated in the aft right seat, the crew were  responding to  an accident when the call was cancelled enroute and they turned back to their base. The flight nurse described the flight as normal, and stated that the helicopter was \"working beautifully.\" He said that the pilot approached the helipad slightly faster than normal. As the helicopter neared the helipad, it made an abrupt \"roll\" to the left. The pilot did not say anything and did not correct for the roll. The helicopter impacted terrain and came to rest on its left side. The flight nurse stated that he and the flight paramedic unbuckled their restraints, exited the helicopter from the aft right door, and immediately tended to the pilot. The flight nurse said his first instinct was that the pilot had some sort of cardiac event. Using his flashlight, he could see that the pilot's face was blue, he was not breathing, and was unresponsive. The engine was still running, so another pilot (who witnessed and responded to the accident) performed an emergency shutdown, and all three of them pulled the pilot out of the helicopter from the windshield and initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).&#x0D;\nThe flight paramedic stated that, about 10-15 ft above the ground, the helicopter rolled 45° to the left. The flight paramedic said, \"It felt if no correction was made and [the helicopter] continued to the ground. I could hear rotors striking the ground.\" When the helicopter stopped moving, he and the flight nurse exited the aft right door. The engine was still running so it was shut down. The pilot, who was unconscious and not breathing, was pulled from the helicopter and immediately administered CPR. &#x0D;\nA witness, who was also a helicopter pilot, saw the accident helicopter making a \"shallow approach\" to the helipad. He turned his attention away for a moment, but when he looked back at the helicopter, it had impacted the ground and he could see \"flying debris and water from the nearby pond.\"&#x0D;\n - An autopsy of the pilot was conducted by the Alabama Department of Forensic Science, Montgomery, Alabama. The cause of death was determined to be hypertensive and arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease complicated by blunt force injuries and the manner of death was accident. &#x0D;\nThe pilot's heart was enlarged at 510 grams (average for a man of his weight is 367 gm with a range of 278-484 gm). In addition, coronary artery disease, including 70%-80% stenosis of the left main, 80-90% stenosis of the left anterior descending, 70-80% stenosis of the circumflex, and 40-50% stenosis of the right coronary, was identified. Wall thickness was not described. The visual inspection of the heart muscle was unremarkable; histology was not performed. In addition, the pathologist reported the presence of hypertensive cardiovascular disease based on the appearance of the kidneys. &#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences identified only naproxen in femoral blood. Naproxen is a mild anti-inflammatory analgesic available over the counter and often marketed with the names Naprosyn and Aleve. It is not considered impairing. &#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA's Forensic Science Laboratory identified lansoprazole, ranitidine, and lidocaine in femoral blood and liver tissue. Dexlansoprazole is metabolized to lansoprazole and is used to treat GERD. It is often marketed with the name Dexilant and is not considered impairing. Ranitidine is an over-the-counter medication also used to treat symptoms of heartburn; it is commonly marketed as Zantac and is not considered impairing. Lidocaine is an anesthetic and available over the counter in patches, gels, or creams for topical use of local pain. Used this way, it is not considered impairing. When used intravenously, lidocaine is also an anti-arrhythmic drug that may be used in the treatment of cardiac arrest.&#x0D;\n - The pilot was hired by Viking, LLC, on December 2, 2019, and completed training on December 6, 2019. He completed his first 7-day \"hitch\" with Survival Flight, Inc. between December 10 -17, 2019, then had 7 days off. The day of the accident was the pilot's first day starting his second 7-day \"hitch.\" The operator stated that the pilot's normal duty hours were 0700 to 1900. He flew one flight on the day of the accident before the accident flight. Both the flight nurse and paramedic stated that flight was normal, and they did not observe any medical issues with the pilot prior to the accident flight. The pilot was in a good mood and had not expressed any issues with stress or fatigue.&#x0D;\n - The helicopter impacted level, soft grass about 120 ft west-northwest of the helipad. It came to rest on its left side on a heading of about 103° in about 3 to 6 inches of standing water from recent rainfall. There was no postimpact fire. &#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter revealed that all four main rotor blades had separated from the main rotor at the hub and came to rest adjacent to the wreckage. All four blades exhibited extensive impact damage and pieces of composite blade material were strewn around the wreckage area. The left skid was displaced inward. &#x0D;\nThe fuselage sustained minor damage and all occupied seats remained securely attached to their respective floor fittings. The pilot's four-point seatbelt/shoulder harness was securely attached to the airframe and was found unbuckled, but when manually tested, it functioned normally. The inertial reel also functioned normally (locked) when tested. Both the flight nurse and paramedic’s three-point seatbelt/shoulder harness (inertial reel) systems were secure to their respective airframe attach points and functioned normally when tested. No mechanical issues were noted with the seats or restraint systems.&#x0D;\nThe tail boom was fractured about 12 to 15 inches aft of the tail boom-to-fuselage attachment point. The tail rotor drive shaft was severed in three locations due to impact; however, continuity was established to the tail rotor. The tail rotor gearbox and both blades were intact, but one blade exhibited some impact damage. The gearbox chip detector was absent of debris. The right stabilator was undamaged and the left hand stabilator sustained impact damage. The top vertical fin exhibited minor leading-edge impact damage.&#x0D;\nFlight and engine control continuity were established for the engine, main rotor, and tail rotor system, by manual manipulation of the anti-torque pedals, collective and cyclic in the cockpit. No mechanical issues were observed that would have precluded normal operation at the time of impact.&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that it was secure to its respective mounts and did not sustain any impact damage. There was evidence of engine and drive train rotation at the time of impact and continuity was established for both N1 and N2 rotors. The upper and lower chip detectors were removed and absent of ferrous metal debris. The helicopter was equipped with an engine control unit (ECU), which was removed and downloaded. The ECU data indicated the engine was performing normally prior to the accident sequence. All relevant engine parameters (torque, Ng/Np speeds, fuel flow, and temperature) were normal prior to the accident and responded as expected during the accident sequence. No mechanical issues were observed with the engine that would have precluded normal operation at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter was flying over the Gulf of Mexico between two oil platforms. Flight track data showed the helicopter in cruise flight at 700 ft mean sea level (msl) before it gradually descended to 375 ft msl. Just before the data ended, the helicopter entered a left turn, descended to 150 ft msl, and slowed from about 115 knots (kts) groundspeed to about 75 kts groundspeed. The helicopter impacted the water and sank to the sea floor. The main wreckage was eventually located on the sea floor about 350 ft southwest of the last recorded flight track point. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that the power turbine pinion gear teeth were significantly worn and smeared, which ultimately resulted in the engine’s inability to provide power to the rotor system. While the majority of the No. 3 bearing was not recovered, the significant thermal damage and loss of material of the power turbine pinion gear shoulder, to which the No. 3 bearing inner race was installed, indicated that the bearing likely failed first, but the cause of the No. 3 bearing failure could not be determined because the bearing was not recovered. The failure of the No. 3 bearing could result in misalignment of the gear mesh between the power turbine pinion gear and the torquemeter gear, which likely caused the pinion gear teeth to rapidly degrade and/or fracture. The initial failure of the No. 3 bearing would have resulted in the failure of the No. 4 bearing and the power turbine pinion gear. The reasons why damage to the Nos. 3 and 4 bearings and the power turbine pinion gear did not result in an engine chip light or oil filter contamination, leading to a filter bypass indication, could not be determined based on the available evidence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe blockages observed in the oil delivery tube and oil nozzle were consistent with corrosion, likely due to postaccident saltwater immersion; therefore, whether there were any preexisting anomalies of the oil delivery tube jets and/or the oil nozzle, such as oil coking, could not be determined. However, the remainder of the recovered engine bearings and gears did not show evidence of damage associated with a widespread lubrication issue. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnalysis of the caution and warning panel bulb filaments showed that several annunciator lights were illuminated at the time of impact, consistent with the effects of a loss of engine power due to a failure of the power turbine pinion gear. The main rotor rpm warning light would have illuminated within a second of the loss of engine power as main rotor speed (Nr) decreased, and the hydraulic system and transmission oil pressure annunciator lights would have illuminated once Nr decreased to critical levels. The data downloaded from the helicopter’s engine control unit was also consistent with a loss of engine power and subsequent loss of Nr.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhile collective pitch was reduced for a few seconds after the loss of engine power, collective pitch was subsequently increased, which led to a quicker decay of Nr. The substantial decrease in Nr would have affected controllability of the helicopter and ultimately resulted in a loss of control. The pilot’s cyclic and pedal inputs, as well as the helicopter’s attitude and airspeed, at the time of the loss of engine power were not known. Therefore, it could not be determined if the pilot successfully entered autorotation or the reasons why the pilot increased collective control about 3 seconds after the loss of engine power. There was no evidence that the emergency flotation system was deployed. While flight track data for the accident flight was available, the last few data points were discontinuous and could not be reliably matched with the recorded engine data; therefore, it could not be determined if the pilot was in a position to deploy the emergency flotation system following the loss of power.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Engine Electronic Control Unit (ECU) Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe non-volatile memory was successfully recovered from the ECU’s interval chips, which included engine fault history, engine history, and engine incident recording data. The recovered data from the maintenance terminal showed multiple faults logged in the fault history of the primary governor, all of which related to power turbine or rotor functions. Three incidents were logged in the incident recorder: 1) an engine power turbine speed (Np) high exceedance; 2) helicopter rotor speed (Nr) droop; and 3) a Np overspeed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ECU data indicated that the engine had performed normally until a sudden overspeed of the power turbine and a steep drop in torque occurred. Nr decreased rapidly and went below 80% within 2.5 seconds of the power turbine overspeed. Immediately after the overspeed occurred, collective position gradually decreased over the next 3 seconds, which slowed the rate of the Nr decay, but not enough to recover Nr. Collective then increased until the end of the ECU data, resulting in an increased rate of Nr decay until its lowest value of 17% at the end of recorded data.&#x0D;\n - At the time of the accident, the helicopter had an aircraft total time (ATT) of 8,500.8 hours and an engine total time (ETT) of 7,584.7 hours. The engine was installed on the accident helicopter on November 16, 2016, at an ATT of 6,811.6 hours and ETT of 6,264.6 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA 600-hour/12-month inspection and an engine oil change were last performed on May 12, 2019, at an ATT of 7,786.3 hours (ETT of 6,870.2 hours) as well as on October 21, 2019, at an ATT of 8,382.1 hours (ETT of 7,466.0 hours). According to the operator’s director of maintenance, during a typical engine oil change, the combined engine filter assembly (CEFA) oil filter, which filters engine scavenge oil, is inspected for contamination and reinstalled if none is found. A review of the engine and aircraft maintenance records from April 2018 until December 2019 found no entries regarding engine chip indications. During that timeframe, there were two instances of the CEFA oil filter bypass indicator extending, the first on April 24, 2018, at an ATT of 7,180.7 hours (ETT of 6,264.6 hours) and the second on September 25, 2019, at an ATT of 8,286.6 hours (ETT of 7,370.5 hours), neither of which found contamination of the CEFA oil filter. According to the director of maintenance, the CEFA oil filter bypass indicator extending is not a common occurrence but can happen in colder ambient temperatures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe maintenance records showed that the accident engine was last overhauled in September 2016 at an ETT of 5,894.1 hours. The last overhaul included completion of the 2,000-hour nonintrusive gearbox inspection, a visual inspection primarily aimed at the power turbine pinion and torquemeter gear mesh. No anomalous findings were reported.&#x0D;\n - On December 7, 2019, at 0918 central standard time, a Bell 407 helicopter, N79LP, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident in the Gulf of Mexico, about 25 nautical miles southeast of Grand Isle, Louisiana. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 business flight.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nIn a statement provided by the operator, the helicopter had departed oil platform SP77A about 0834 and was en route to platform WD73, located about 17 nautical miles northwest. The pilot was to conduct pollution control inspections while en route to the destination platform. At 0853, the pilot landed at platform WD109 for additional fuel, but discovered that the fuel nozzle was broken and was unable to refuel. At 0910, the helicopter departed platform WD109 with 1 hour and 20 minutes of fuel reported, 2 persons onboard, and estimated time en route of 20 minutes. The operator tracked the helicopter via Sky Connect Tracker Systems.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecorded ADS-B data revealed that the helicopter’s flight track began at 0912:50 about 1.5 miles west-northwest of platform WD109 at 700 ft mean sea level (msl) and 115 knots groundspeed. The helicopter continued northwest for about 10.5 miles and gradually descended to 375 ft msl. At 0918:10, the helicopter’s heading was 292° at a groundspeed of 114 knots and altitude of 375 ft msl. The final recorded point, at 0918:18, showed that the helicopter made a left course deviation to 270°, descended to 150 ft msl, and slowed to 72 knots. Figure 1 shows the platforms, recorded ADS-B flight path, and initial main wreckage location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 – Main wreckage location, flight track and platforms.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0915, the pilot contacted WD73 personnel and reported that he was 10 minutes from the platform. At 1011, when the helicopter had not landed at WD73, platform personnel reported it overdue. An alert notice (ALNOT) was issued at 1121. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe United States Coast Guard recovered several small pieces of the helicopter, including a cargo door, a compressed gas cylinder, and seat cushions. The debris was found near another platform about 25 miles west of where the main wreckage was eventually located. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 14, 2019, during a side-scan sonar mission near the last ADS-B point, the sonar hooked onto the left skid tube of the helicopter. The sonar boat pulled the skid tube up to the boat and transferred it to the wreckage recovery company. Pieces of helicopter debris were visible on the sonar images, and divers marked the location for a future recovery. The main wreckage location was about 350 ft southwest of the last ADS-B point and was on the sea floor, about 190 ft underwater. Due to adverse weather in the Gulf of Mexico, the recovery was postponed until December 20, 2019. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 16, 2019, a shrimp trawler unintentionally caught the helicopter wreckage in its nets and dragged the wreckage about 3 miles. When the wreckage was noticed to be caught in the net, the trawler stopped, and the wreckage eventually broke loose and sank back to the sea floor. The main wreckage was recovered from the Gulf of Mexico on December 20, 2019, and transported to a recovery facility in Louisiana.&#x0D;\n - The pilot’s body was not recovered during the course of the investigation.&#x0D;\n - The weather in the area was reported by the operator as wind from 050° at 10 knots, broken clouds at 1,700 ft, no precipitation, and 5 miles visibility in haze. A platform WD73 worker reported the clouds were 800 to 1,000 ft, and 7 to 10 miles visibility with a gray sky.&#x0D;\n - The pilot initially departed Grand Isle, Louisiana, about 0655 on the morning of the accident.  He accumulated over 2 hours of flight time and was on the eighth leg of the day when the accident occurred.&#x0D;\n - Metallographic Examination of Gears and Bearings&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRolls-Royce completed a metallographic examination of the retained engine components. The power turbine pinion gear exhibited evidence of fatigue fractures on six consecutive gear teeth. The fatigue fractures originated on the drive side tooth root fillets and exhibited multiple origins. The fatigue fractures progressed toward the coast side (the non-drive and non-contact side) of the gear tooth. No dimensional anomalies were observed at the fracture origins or the gear tooth root surfaces adjacent to the origins. All pinion gear teeth exhibited circumferential rubbing and smearing. The Nos. 3 and 4 bearing journals on the power turbine pinion gear also exhibited circumferential rubbing damage and thermal distress, with the No. 3 bearing journal showing significant deformation and material loss compared to the No. 4 bearing journal. Analysis of the material composition and core microstructure of the power turbine pinion gear, away from areas of thermal distress, showed that they met drawing requirements. The No. 3 bearing outer ring exhibited material removal on its roller path and circumferential rubbing on the forward shoulder corner. The outer ring’s raceway and forward shoulder corner displayed thermal distress. Analysis of the material composition and microstructure of the outer ring, away from areas of thermal distress, showed that they met drawing requirements. The No. 4 bearing outer ring exhibited material removal on its roller path and circumferential rubbing on the aft shoulder corner. Transferred material and roller impressions were observed on the raceway of the inner ring. The inner ring’s forward shoulder also exhibited deformation in the forward direction. The inner diameter of the inner ring exhibited circumferential rubbing and transferred material. The outer ring’s raceway and forward shoulder corner, the roller diameters, and the inner ring exhibited thermal distress. The recovered rollers all exhibited a circumferential rub step on one end. Analysis of the material composition of the outer ring, inner ring, and rollers met drawing requirements. Microstructure analysis away from the area of thermal distress could only be accomplished on the outer ring and a representative roller. The microstructure for both components met drawing requirements. The No. 2.5 bearing support exhibited circumferential rubbing consistent with contact with the inner diameter of the power turbine pinion gear. The No. 2.5 bearing support was corroded, and its aft face was deformed forward at the 12 o’clock position. The area of deformation on the aft face also showed evidence of circumferential rubbing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nComputed Tomography (CT) Scans of Piccolo Tube and Oil Nozzle&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe piccolo tube showed material deposits on the internal passageway walls and all of its oil jets appeared to be blocked. Additionally, material was observed within the oil screen of the remnant gearbox housing material attached to the piccolo tube. The piccolo tube was sectioned in multiple locations to analyze the tube, the remnant gearbox housing material, and deposits within the tube. The oil delivery tube and gearbox housing material were consistent with drawing requirements. The deposits within the oil jets were consistent with byproducts of aluminum (piccolo tube) corrosion and dirt. Additionally, fine metallic particles observed in the deposits were consistent with an iron-based alloy. A representative iron-based alloy particle measured about 0.0008 in. long. Material seen within the oil screen was consistent with byproducts of magnesium (gearbox housing) corrosion. The CT scan of the oil nozzle for the Nos. 4 and 5 bearings showed material deposits on the internal passageway walls and all of the oil jets appeared to be blocked. The oil nozzle was sectioned in multiple locations for further analysis. The oil nozzle material was consistent with drawing requirements. The blockage material was consistent with byproducts of aluminum (oil nozzle) corrosion and dirt. Additionally, fine metallic particles observed within the deposits were consistent with an iron-based alloy, as well as byproducts of magnesium corrosion. A representative iron-based alloy particle was measured to be about 0.0028 in. long.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCaution and Warning Panel&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe caution and warning panel was examined by the NTSB Materials Laboratory using a stereomicroscope. Each annunciator light consisted of three bulbs. For several bulbs, the glass globe had a clouded appearance, and the filaments could not be visually examined; these bulbs were removed from the panel and the individual bulb was x-rayed to examine the filaments. Seven lights exhibited stretched filaments. Table 1 contains excerpts from Bell 407 rotorcraft flight manual applicable to those annunciator lights in which filaments were found stretched. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n - The main fuselage was fractured, folded, and twisted in multiple locations, but remained connected via wiring and netting from the shrimp trawler. The forward portion of the tail boom remained connected to the intermediate fuselage but was fractured at the tail boom tube structure. The remainder of the tail boom, including the vertical and horizontal stabilizers, was not recovered. The main rotor gearbox remained attached to the transmission deck. The gearbox housing exhibited extensive corrosion due to saltwater immersion. The main rotor gearbox chip detectors were removed and exhibited extensive corrosion, but no metallic chips were present. The emergency flotation system was installed under the provisions of Supplemental Type Certificate SR01450LA. All floats were found outside their covers but did not show evidence of inflation and exhibited a vacuum-deflated appearance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was separated from the airframe but remained partially attached via the wiring harness. The majority of the accessory gearbox housing was consumed by corrosion due to saltwater immersion, and the compressor section was partially separated from the combustion and turbine sections. The airframe-mounted fuel filter remained attached to the airframe and was removed from its mount and disassembled. The fuel filter bowl contained about 0.25 ounces of liquid with a color and odor similar to that of Jet A fuel and the fuel filter was clear of contaminants. The throttle lever was present and indicated about 15 degrees, which corresponded to below idle and beyond the throttle lock-out. The CEFA was impact-separated from the wreckage. The CEFA’s oil filter bypass indicator was not extended, which is the position for when the filter is not in bypass mode. Residual oil and fuel, along with salt water, were present in the CEFA, including the filter bowls. The fuel filter element was removed, and no debris was observed. The scavenge oil filter element was removed and metallic debris was found on the filter element and its filter bowl. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral gears and engine accessories from the accessory gearbox were recovered separated from the engine assembly. The power turbine pinion gear, part of the power turbine-to-pinion (N2) gear train, was found loose in the accessory gearbox and exhibited severe wear and smearing damage on its gear teeth and bearing shoulders. Figure 2 shows a comparison of the accident power turbine pinion gear (left) to an exemplar power turbine pinion gear (right).  &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nFigure 2 – Accident power turbine pinion gear (left) and an exemplar power turbine pinion gear (right).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe No. 4 roller bearing, normally installed on the aft end of the power turbine pinion gear, was severely worn and its roller elements were found loose in the gearbox cavity, along with the pinion gear. Nine of the twelve roller elements from the No. 4 bearing were recovered. The No. 3 roller bearing outer ring was present and exhibited severe wear. The inner race, roller elements, and bearing cage for the No. 3 bearing were not recovered. The engine was relocated to a specialized engine shop and disassembled. The oil nozzle for the Nos. 4 and 5 bearings remained attached to the gearbox and were corroded but did not exhibit other damage. The No. 5 bearing did not exhibit anomalous wear. Corrosion and mud were observed throughout the accessory gearbox, and additional roller elements from the Nos. 3 or 4 bearings were not found in the remnant mud or within the gearbox. The oil delivery tube for the Nos. 3 and 4 bearings, also known as the “piccolo tube,” exhibited severe corrosion. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe following engine components were identified for additional testing and analysis: the No. 4 bearing; the piccolo tube oil nozzle; the oil nozzle for the Nos. 4 and 5 bearings; the housing for the Nos. 3 and 4 bearing; the power takeoff gear; the power turbine pinion gear; the scavenge oil filter and its filter bowl; the pressurized oil filter; the N2 shaft; the No. 2.5 bearing and its support; and an oil sample from the CEFA oil filter.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was performing low-level flight over high desert terrain. The passenger reported that, during the flight, the pilot became concerned over a low “rpm” indication. The pilot began to manipulate the flight controls, and the helicopter rapidly descended, yawed to the right, and impacted terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination revealed that significant sections of the outer liner of the engine’s air induction hose were abraded, consistent with long-term wear, and had worn away from the supporting structure, allowing the hose liner to collapse and restrict airflow into the engine. Given this condition, the engine would have experienced a partial power loss due to the restricted airflow; damage signatures indicated that the engine was producing some power at the time of impact. The helicopter’s most recent annual inspection was completed about three months before the accident, and the worn hose should have been apparent at the time of the inspection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data indicated that, before the accident, the helicopter was traveling at a speed and altitude such that, in the event of an engine failure, the pilot would have had limited time to enter and establish a controlled autorotative descent. The helicopter’s operating handbook stated that, at low altitude and low speed, sufficient altitude may not be available to increase rotor rpm following a loss of engine power. Impact damage to the helicopter was consistent with an uncontrolled collision with terrain. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a current emergency locator transmitter (ELT), but it had been incorrectly installed inside the metal baggage compartment in a portable configuration and was not equipped with the required external antenna. Therefore, although the ELT activated, it’s signal was likely shielded by the metal compartment, and not received by search and rescue personnel. As a result, the helicopter was not discovered until the following morning. Even if the ELT signal had been received, the unit was not registered with the current owner; this could potentially have resulted in a delay as search and rescue personnel attempted to track down the owner and ascertain the validity of the alert.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "The Helicopter Performance section of the FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21B) discusses the height/velocity diagram, in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe diagram shows the combinations of airspeed and height above the ground, which will allow an average pilot to successfully complete a landing after an engine failure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe shaded area on the lower right is dangerous due to the airspeed and proximity to the ground resulting in dramatically reduced reaction time for the pilot in the case of mechanical failure, or other in-flight emergencies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on the helicopter’s basic empty weight, fuel load, and occupant weight, the gross weight at takeoff was about 2,350 lbs. The height/velocity diagram for 2,350 lbs gross weight, as documented in the helicopter’s operator’s manual, is represented in Figure 2. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 – 2,350-lb gross weight height/velocity diagram&#x0D;\nThe operator’s manual also stated: &#x0D;\nWhen an engine failure occurs at low altitude and low airspeed, sufficient altitude may not be available to increase rotor rpm…&#x0D;\nThe passenger stated that the flight was performed at a relatively low altitude, but she assumed, at least for the time that they flew around the horses, that the helicopter was about 500 ft agl. She based this assumption on the fact that the pilot utilized an iPad with software that included a terrain feature that would annunciate if the helicopter was below 500 ft agl; she did not hear any such annunciations.&#x0D;\nExamination of the iPad revealed that the pilot utilized the ForeFlight application for navigation. According to ForeFlight documentation: &#x0D;\n500' AGL Alerts - The 500’ AGL alert is a simple callout that triggers when you descend through 500’ AGL after having been above 1,000’ AGL. The alert will only sound once every 60 seconds and is automatically disabled if your groundspeed is less than 40 knots.&#x0D;\nADS-B data indicated that the helicopter did not fly above 900 ft agl during the flight, therefore the 500’ agl alert would not have been active.&#x0D;\n - On October 25, 2019, about 1541 mountain daylight time, an Enstrom 280F helicopter, N280F, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Jordan Valley, Oregon. The pilot was fatally injured, and the pilot-rated passenger sustained serious injuries. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the passenger, the intent of the flight was to fly from their home base of Caldwell Industrial Airport (EUL), Caldwell, Idaho, toward the Owyhee Mountain Range and Reservoir, a trip they had taken multiple times before. Upon her arrival at the airport that afternoon, the pilot had already moved the helicopter out of the hangar. A short time later, they boarded and taxied to the local fueling facility, where the pilot serviced the helicopter with the addition of 22.5 gallons of fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe passenger stated that the departure was to the southwest and was uneventful, and after arriving over the Owyhee Mountain Range, they observed some wild horses. The pilot performed an orbit over the horses while the passenger took photos (See figure 1, inset). Once complete, they proceeded toward the southwest.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA few minutes later, the pilot calmly stated that the \"rpm\" was low. Due to the tone of his voice, the passenger was not initially concerned, and continued to look out of the window; however, a short time later, the pilot appeared to have become nervous and began manipulating (“working”) the collective control.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no change in the sound or feel of the helicopter, but when the passenger looked at the instrument panel, one of the needles that she was used to seeing in the green zone was just to the left of that normal position. The helicopter then rapidly descended, yawed right, and struck the ground right side down.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFamily members became concerned when neither occupant returned home that evening and contacted local law enforcement. The wreckage was located the following morning. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) flight track data of the entire flight indicated that the helicopter maintained a terrain clearance of between 350 and 900 ft above ground level (agl) after departure as it approached the mountain range, while maintaining a groundspeed of about 100 mph. As it entered the range, the helicopter continued to climb as the ground speed slowed to 85 mph. It started to follow the undulating terrain with clearances varying between o and 100 ft agl, until 18 minutes after takeoff and 25 miles southwest of EUL. It then began an orbit at a GPS altitude of about 4,900 ft, which was between 50 and 200 ft agl over terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter completing the orbit, the helicopter departed to the southwest at an altitude of about 5,000 ft mean sea level (msl), and continued for the remaining 2 miles at the same altitude, which corresponded to terrain clearance of between 0 and 50 ft agl, at a ground speed of about 70 mph. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 – ADS-B derived route of flight&#x0D;\n - The Department of Pathology, Saint Alphonsus Medical Center – Ontario (Oregon), performed the pilot’s autopsy at the request of the Malheur County Medical Examiner. According to the Medical Examiner, the cause of death was multiple traumatic injuries due to helicopter crash, and the manner of death was accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo impairing drugs were found in toxicological testing.&#x0D;\n - The pilot’s logbook was not located; however, he reported 900 total hours of flight experience at the time of his last Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical examination on May 20, 2016. The pilot completed the requirements for operation under BasicMed on August 10, 2018. &#x0D;\n - The helicopter was equipped with a 406 AF-COMPACT emergency locator transmitter (ELT), manufactured by Kannad in accordance with FAA technical standard order (TSO) C126. However, no activation signal was received by the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) following the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe manufacturers installation instructions state that in helicopter applications, the unit must be installed 45° relative to the yaw axis and mounted to a structural member. The installation instructions further stated that an external antenna must be used and installed on the top of the helicopter. On-site examination revealed that the ELT, rather being mounted to a structural member, had been mounted within the enclosed aluminum baggage compartment, on the left side of the floor panel. The unit was not utilizing an external antenna, but instead was connected directly to a portable auxiliary “whip” antenna which had been mounted inside the baggage compartment on the left wall. The ELT power switch was found in the “armed” position at the accident site, and the unit could be heard emitting an audio tone consistent with activation and transmission of its emergency signal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTesting of the ELT revealed that the unit passed all tests, and the battery still contained sufficient charge for operation. Review of NOAA registration data indicated that the ELT had not been registered to the current owner, as required by Federal Aviation Regulations, but instead was still registered to the helicopter’s previous owner. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot and passenger were both using the helicopters factory-installed 3-point harness. The helicopter was not equipped with any emergency survival equipment, and the passenger stated that she was wearing pants and a shirt and had left here jacket in the hangar prior to flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n - The helicopter was located about 500 ft south of the last ADS-B target at an elevation of 4,917 ft msl. The helicopter came to rest on its right side on a heading of about 330° magnetic. &#x0D;\nThe first identified point of impact was characterized by an area of disrupted earth about 25 ft north of the main wreckage, which contained fragments of canopy plexiglass and cabin contents. A series of imprints just forward of the disruption matched the general outline of the forward section of the landing gear skids, beyond which a series of perpendicular slash marks indicated ground contact of the main rotor blade tips.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll three main rotor blades remained attached to the hub, and all exhibited 30° upward bending damage, along with leading edge and chordwise abrasion. Examination of the airframe and flight controls revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine sustained minimal damage and there was no evidence of catastrophic internal failure. The engine controls were continuous from their respective control arms to the cabin controls. The inlet air filter was free of obstruction. The dual magneto was intact and undamaged, and the engine-to-magneto timing met the manufacturer’s recommended specifications. The spark plug electrodes were mechanically undamaged, coated in light grey deposits, and displayed normal wear signatures. Five of the engine cooling fan blades had bent about 90° opposite the direction of rotation, and rotational scoring and gouging was observed on the right side of the fan shroud adjacent to the blade tips. Examination of the fuel system revealed no anomalies, and fuel was recovered from both tanks. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main transmission belt engagement clutch was in the fully engaged position, and there was no apparent damage or significant degradation of the drive belt. The freewheeling unit (overrunning clutch) allowed for transmission rotation in the correct direction. The engine and main rotor tachometer drives were intact and operational. The tachometer was subsequently removed, tested, and disassembled. No mechanical anomalies were noted, and the unit met the original manufacturers performance specifications. The helicopter was not equipped with an audio or visual low rotor-rpm warning system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine’s air induction system was composed of an air filter assembly connected to the fuel injection servo via a flexible intake hose. The servo was connected directly to the compressor section of the turbocharger, the outlet of which forced the air and fuel mixture directly into the engine induction manifold.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flexible hose was a 3-inch diameter, “Silfab-2” type, constructed of a spring steel helix, bonded between a liner and cover which were both composed of fiberglass fabric impregnated silicone rubber. The outer surface of the hose was double wound with a fiberglass cord.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDetailed examination of the hose revealed that the outer cover and fiberglass cord had abraded, such that the steel helix was visible and protruding over about half of the hose’s length. (see Photos 1 and 2.) In some areas, the helix was visible for more than half of the hose circumference, such that the liner and cover were unsupported and could be flexed inward, partially obstructing the flow.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe air induction system section of the helicopter’s 100hr/annual inspection guide stated: “Inspect the flex duct and fuel servo adapter for condition and security of&#x0D;\ninstallation.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPhoto 1 – Engine air induction hose with steel helix visible at multiple locations &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPhoto 2 - Engine air induction hose with protruding steel helix &#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot rented the helicopter to make a local personal flight. Radar data indicated that, after maneuvering around the area of a nearby national conservation, the helicopter flew along a road back toward the airport. The helicopter continued at an altitude between 500 to 700 ft above ground level (agl) for about 30 seconds then radar data ended 1 nautical mile from the accident site. A witness observed the helicopter impact the ravine adjacent to the road and break apart on impact. Ground scar analysis and wreckage fragmentation revealed that the helicopter collided with terrain in a tail-low attitude, consistent with the pilot performing an autorotation before impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination revealed evidence that the engine was running at the time of impact. The white exhaust signatures were consistent with lean operation. Examination of the engine compartment revealed that one magnet in the main rotor tachometer indicating system was separated from its housing from the yoke assembly; the other magnet assembly remained secured to the yoke assembly. The yoke assembly was not damaged, but there was evidence of slight damage to both senders, consistent with the magnet contacting the senders. With only one magnet installed, the main rotor tachometer rpm would indicate about 50% of the actual rotor rpm and the low rotor rpm horn would sound. It could not be determined if the magnet came free from the housing prior to impact. Examination of the magnet assembly revealed signatures consistent with compliance with a manufacturer service bulletin requiring the use of adhesive to secure the magnets. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was refueled the morning of the accident, and the fuel was sumped by a pilot receiving instruction and a flight instructor. The fuel samples from the main fuel tank were dirty and they opted to cancel the flight and have a mechanic flush the tanks. The mechanic never flushed the tanks, but the flight instructor reportedly took more samples later in the day until they were clean. When the accident pilot arrived before the flight, he was told that the helicopter had completed maintenance and was informed that an earlier flight was canceled because a pilot had found sediment in the fuel tanks. The accident pilot’s preflight actions could not be determined, but it is likely he would have sumped the tanks and found them to be clean, given that he was aware of an issue earlier in the day. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators took samples of the liquid in the gascolator while at the accident site. The color was an orange-yellow and there was some debris in the bowl that displayed a gelatinous consistency; the screen was clear. The remainder of the fuel found in the system was free of contamination. An analysis of the fuel was consistent with that of normal aviation fuel with the presence of iron and brass consistent with that of corrosion. A further examination of the remaining fuel showed the presence of fillers in a polymeric material. The origin of the material found is unknown and the effect, if any, on the helicopter performance could not be determined. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe reason the pilot conducted an auto-rotation could not be determined. It is feasible that if the magnet from the rotor tachometer separated inflight, the pilot would hear the magnet contact the airframe, have the low-rotor warning horn sound, the main rotor tachometer rpm would display 50%, and in response he would perform an autorotation. This scenario could not be determined because of the damage incurred to the airframe during the accident sequence. Because there was evidence that the engine was running at the time of impact, it could also not be determined if the fuel contributed to an inflight event that resulted in the pilot’s decision to make an autorotation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Previous Events&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Robinson Helicopter Company representative reported that instances of a magnet separating from a magnet assembly prompted issuance of Service Bulletin (SB) 86, which required an adhesive be applied between the magnet and the magnet housing and a yellow dot placed on the magnet housing. The accident helicopter’s records did not contain entries related to the SB, but yellow/orange dots were found on the magnet assemblies, suggesting compliance with the SB.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the NTSB database revealed two accidents that cited the magnet separation in the probable cause. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nERA17LA163 - April 2017&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that he was descending when he heard and felt a loud \"pop\" that was accompanied by a yaw to the right, shaking and vibration, with engine roughness. At that time the rotor tachometer had, \"dropped to zero\", while the engine tachometer was \"at about 60-70%.\" He immediately entered an autorotative descent to a median between two roads and landed hard.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the engine compartment revealed one magnet in the main rotor tachometer indicating system was separated with its housing from the yoke assembly; the other magnet assembly remained secured to the yoke assembly. The yoke assembly was not damaged, but there was evidence of slight damage to one sender assembly, consistent with the magnet assembly separation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe probable cause was cited as a partial failure of the helicopter's rotor tachometer due to the separation of one of the magnet assemblies and engine roughness, which precipitated the pilot's initiation of an off-airport autorotation, during which he applied improper aft cyclic flight control input, which was contrary to the Pilot's Operating Handbook. The reason for the reported engine roughness could not be determined during postaccident examination and engine test-runs. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCEN13LA194 - March 2013&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilots were en route when they heard a loud “bang,” followed immediately by the low rotor rpm horn, a warning light illumination, and a rapid decrease in rotor rpm indication. In response, the instructor initiated an autorotation by lowering the collective, and the engine immediately lost power. The helicopter touched down and then rocked forward due to soft and downward-sloping terrain. A post accident examination revealed that one magnet in the main rotor tachometer indicating system was separated from its housing on the yoke assembly; the other magnet assembly remained secured to the yoke assembly. Deformation was found on one of the sensors opposite the magnet, indicating that the magnet had contacted the sensor see Figure 10 below). The separation of the magnet caused the rotor rpm indication to drop and the low rotor rpm warning horn and light to activate. Due to the control linkage between the collective and the throttle, when the instructor lowered the collective, the throttle closed rapidly. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Robinson Helicopters, the control linkage between the collective and the throttle (the correlator) will close the throttle when the collective is lowered, resulting in an engine rpm change of only a few percent. When a pilot rapidly rolls the throttle to idle, this can result in a fuel-air ratio becoming too rich or too lean to sustain engine operation and result in an engine failure. Robinson representatives further stated that the pilot would need to roll off the throttle with the twist grip to cause enough of a change to potentially cause the engine to quit, and this is only likely to happen at high altitudes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe probable cause was cited as a total loss of engine power due to a rapid throttle change during autorotation, which the flight instructor initiated in response to a low rotor rpm warning, which resulted from the separation of one of the magnets used to provide rotor rpm indications from the rotating transmission yoke. Contributing to the accident was the flight instructor's aft cyclic input upon landing. As a result of the event, Robinson issued Service Bulletin 86. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 10: Magnet Housing and Sensor from Accident CEN13LA194 - The Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter was manufactured in 2005 and was equipped with its original Lycoming IO-540-AE1A5 engine. The tachometer time at the accident site was 3,231.3 hours. According to inspection and maintenance records, the last 50-hour engine inspection was completed on October 08, 2019, at a tachometer time of 3,195.4 hours, 35.9 hours before the accident; the last 100-hour airframe inspection was completed on September 28, 2019, at a total time of 3,144.5 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGovernor and Tachometer System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe collective control for the accident helicopter was conventional and included a twist grip throttle. When the collective control is moved upward, the engine throttle is opened automatically by an interconnecting linkage. The helicopter was equipped with an engine governor system, which sensed engine rpm and applied corrective input forces to the throttle to maintain engine rpm as needed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe governor system comprised a solid-state electronic controller, which determined engine rpm from the tachometer points in the engine's right magneto. When the governor sensed the need to adjust engine rpm, it activated a motor which drove the throttle directly. The governor system was designed to assist the pilot in controlling the rpm in the normal operating range. It may not prevent over- or under-speed conditions generated by aggressive flight maneuvers. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with one electronic dual (engine and rotor) tachometer. The sensor for the engine tachometer is the same set of magneto breaker points used by the governor. The sensor for the rotor tachometer is an electronic Hall effect device, which senses passage of two magnets attached to the main rotor gearbox input yoke assembly. (see figures 3 and 4 below.) Robinson personnel reported that, with only one magnet installed, the main rotor tachometer rpm would indicate about 50% of the actual rotor rpm and the low-rotor rpm horn would sound. The normal rotor/engine rpm is 102% on the tachometer and the lowest numeric marking is “50,” with two graduated lines beneath.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3: Rotor Tachometer Assembly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPicture 4: Location of Rotor Tachometer Assembly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLow Rotor RPM Recovery Procedure&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the R44 Pilot’s Operating Handbook (POH), the recommended procedure to recover from a low rotor rpm warning condition (warning horn and caution light) was as follows: To restore rpm, lower collective, roll throttle on and, in forward flight, apply aft cyclic. According to Robinson, lowering the collective lever will reduce the power required by the rotors to aid the recovery of rotor rpm; however, in the R44 helicopter, the correlator will decrease the throttle when the collective is lowered and reduce engine rpm (by a few percent) unless the pilot or rpm governor system rotates the twist grip to roll throttle on. - On October 23, 2019, at 1553 mountain standard time, a Robinson R44 II Raven, N225JM, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Las Vegas, Nevada. The airline transport pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot contacted the fixed based operator (FBO) that rented the helicopter in the early afternoon on the day of the accident and asked office personnel if the helicopter was available to rent later that afternoon. One of the schedulers responded that the helicopter was undergoing maintenance, and the pilot stated that he would stop by the office anyway to check if the maintenance was done and put money on his account. The pilot and passenger arrived about 10 minutes later. The pilot asked why the helicopter was in maintenance and the office personnel told him that an earlier flight was canceled because that pilot had found sediment in the fuel tanks. The accident pilot stated that he was happy to wait, and about 20 minutes later, the flight instructor who had canceled the earlier flight called, stating that the maintenance was done, and the helicopter was ready to fly. The pilot and passenger planned to take a 1-hour flight. (see figure 1.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Airport to Accident Site&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was also a pilot, stated that while riding his motorcycle, he initially saw the helicopter in the upper right-corner of his vision at an estimated 100 to 200 feet above ground level (agl) in a nose-up attitude and in a very steep descent angle heading opposite his direction of travel. He estimated that the helicopter was moving about the same speed as the traffic (about 50 mph). He witnessed the helicopter impact the ravine adjacent to the road (about 200 ft ahead of him and 100 ft to the right) and break apart on impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of radar flight track data indicated that the helicopter departed and continued west-southwest toward the Red Rock Retention Basin checkpoint. After clearing the Class Bravo airspace, the returns showed a left 360° orbit over Blue Diamond Road, consistent with the pilot circling over a remote control (RC) airpark and the Desert Sportsman’s Rifle Club. Thereafter, the track was consistent with the pilot loosely following the road around Calico Basin and climbing up to 4,700 ft mean sea level (msl), about 400 ft agl. The helicopter then made a left turn and serval maneuvers over the Red Rock National Conservation Area washes, including a possible touchdown, during which the forward airspeed speed was reduced to 0 kts. After performing serval low-level maneuvers, the track was consistent with the helicopter following Blue Diamond Road toward the north-northeast. The last radar return was at 1553:23 about 1 nautical mile (nm) west-southwest of the accident site. The last 30 seconds of the track data indicated an airspeed of about 100 to 120 kts at an altitude between 500 to 700 ft agl. (see figure 2 below.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2: Radar Track Data - The pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with a rating for airplane multiengine land, and commercial privileges for airplane single-engine land and rotorcraft-helicopter. According to information compiled from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, as of the date of the accident, he had approximately 15,000 total hours of flight experience.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s rotorcraft logbook indicated that the pilot began flying helicopters in 2013 with a majority of his earlier experience acquired in a Schweizer helicopter. His last flight was recorded on March 3, 2019, during which he received a 0.9-hour checkout in an R44, including practice autorotations, low rotor rpm recovery, and settling with power. The flight included 6 daytime landings and occurred 234 days before the accident flight. The pilot’s total rotorcraft experience was 352.1 hours, of which 8 flights were in the R44 helicopter, totaling 12.3 hours. The logbook indicated that he had flown the accident helicopter once before on February 8, 2019, for 1.5 hours during which he flew from North Las Vegas to Henderson, Nevada, and back; there were no other recorded helicopter flights from North Las Vegas. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA logbook endorsement dated July 2016 stated that the pilot had completed the awareness training in accordance with paragraphs \"(b)(2)(ii)(a-d) \" of Section 2 of Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) No. 73. The currency requirements provided in the SFAR state that no person may act as pilot-in-command of an R44 helicopter carrying passengers unless the pilot in command has met the recency of flight experience requirements of §61.57 in an R44. In pertinent part, § 61.57 (a)(1) states that “Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, no person may act as a pilot in command of an aircraft carrying passengers … unless that person has made at least three takeoffs and three landings within the preceding 90 days and -(i) The person acted as the sole manipulator of the flight controls; and(ii) The required takeoffs and landings were performed in an aircraft of the same category, class, and type (if a type rating is required)…” The exceptions did not pertain to the accident flight because the pilot was not conducting the flight operation under a part 119 certificate holder. - Fueling Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator of the helicopter instructed pilots to receive fuel at North Las Vegas and owned a 750-gallon truck that served fuel to three businesses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the records provided by the fuelers, the accident helicopter was fueled twice the day before the accident; once at 1138 with 11.6 gallons and once at 1540 with 16.8 gallons. The pilot receiving instruction on both of those flights stated that the fuel was clean of debris and the helicopter functioned normally after refueling. The records further indicated that, about 1830, the truck refueled with 479 gallons of 100LL aviation fuel. Almost immediately after the refueling, the fuel truck then refueled a Cessna 172 with 6.5 gallons. The student and pilot that flew the airplane after that fueling stated that the fuel was clean, and they had no problems on their cross-country flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter was the first aircraft to be fueled in the morning of the accident. According to the fueler, he arrived at the office around 0700 and performed the normal procedure of draining the truck, which included 0.5 gallons of fuel from the lower sump and 0.5 gallons from the filtered hose. He drained both into a white porcelain bucket and noted that both were clean of contaminants. An instructor from the accident operator called for fuel, and at 0825, the accident helicopter was fueled with 23.6 gallons, filling both the auxiliary and main fuel tanks to capacity. Shortly thereafter, another Cessna 172 received 13.3 gallons, and the pilots of that airplane reported no anomalies with the fuel or their flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot receiving instruction scheduled with the instructor for the morning of the accident stated that, after getting fuel, he began performing the preflight with the instructor watching behind him. He retrieved the GATS jar fuel tester from under the right rear seat and proceeded to sump the auxiliary fuel tank. The sample looked clean and he sumped the main tank. The fuel appeared dirty with floating black and gray specks (similar in appearance to sand). He showed the instructor, who poured out the sample on the concrete and suggested that they take another sample. After taking two more samples with the same results, the instructor volunteered to clean the jar, thinking that perhaps it was dirty. He additionally found a 5-gallon bucket and dumped the fuel samples into it, which totaled about 6 to 7 samples. The pilot receiving instruction elected to cancel the flight due to the contaminated fuel samples. The instructor then informed the operator’s mechanic of the samples, but the mechanic stated that he was working on several airplanes and would not be able to look at the fuel system until that afternoon.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanic stated that that he did not have an opportunity to flush the fuel tanks in the accident helicopter. Later in the day, the instructor relayed to the pilot receiving instruction that the mechanic had not had the opportunity to work on the helicopter, and the pilot decided to cancel the scheduled afternoon flight. The accident pilot was then scheduled to fly the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instructor stated that, after they sumped the fuel in the morning, he returned to the helicopter several hours later to check on the mechanic’s progress. He noted that the helicopter was on the list to be inspected, but had yet to undergo maintenance. He drained about one quart of fuel from the helicopter, with the first samples containing fine black, brown, and red grains. With each sample, the fuel became more and more clear, and the final three samples were clean. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel samples were collected from the gascolator at the accident site. The bowl was full with a liquid consistent in odor and appearance with that of 100LL aviation fuel while at the site. The screen was clean of debris. The following day, the same samples were observed to be an orange-yellow color with some debris in the bowl that displayed a gelatinous consistency. (see figure 9 below.) During the post-accident examination, investigators reinstalled the gascolator bowl and removed engine baffling for examination purposes. The electric fuel pump was connected to an external power source and the line from the pressure relief valve was disconnected, routing it into a clean bucket. Upon the pump being energized, fuel flowed freely from the line; the fuel displayed a green hue and was free from contaminants.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 9: Fuel from Gascolator&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators removed the fuel injector lines from their respective cylinders and examined each injector; the injectors were free of particulates. The injectors were reinstalled and glass bottles were placed under each one. The pump was again activated and fuel flowed to each jar; the fuel was blue and clear of contaminants. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe auxiliary fuel tank was cut open and the bladder was pliable and in good condition. There were numerous small, non-ferrous flakes in the remaining fuel. The screen was clean and the restrictor in the interconnect line was free from debris. The examination of the remainder of the fuel system revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunction or failure. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe fuel was sent to a private laboratory for examination. The analysis produced a normal distillation curve and carbon numbers for aviation fuel. In pertinent part, the fuel and the dried residues showed the presence of similar amounts of lead (TEL), iron and zinc-copper (brass) and bromine. The iron and brass were consistent with that of corrosion. A further examination of the remaining fuel showed the presence of low concentrations of glass fibers, Titania particles, and a calcium compound, consistent with fillers in a polymeric material. - The accident site was located in desert terrain about 10 nm from the departure airport on a bearing of 250°. The wreckage was found distributed in a ravine over a 200-ft distance on a median magnetic heading of about 070°. The ravine and debris field ran parallel to the road and was located about 4 to 5 ft below the pavement. The first identified area of impact was an approximate 5-inch line (oriented parallel to the road) of scraping and maroon-colored paint transfer across a rock and orange torque stripe buried in the dirt before the rock. Adjacent to that line was another parallel line of paint transfer that was red in color. The orientation and colors were consistent with the tail rotor guard and tailskid making contact first, indicative of a nose-high attitude at the time of impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe and Engine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mixture control was in the full-rich position. The collective was in a full-up position and the collective friction bolt center was at the top of the slider slot. The pilot’s throttle twist grip was in a position close to full off (idle). Examination of the control systems revealed no evidence of pre-impact mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotational signatures on the aft surface of the engine cooling fan, starter ring gear and oil cooler, alternator, and the belt tension actuator vertical tube surfaces were consistent with the engine producing power at the time of impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn external visual examination of the engine revealed crush damage to the bottom of the crankcase, with the majority of damage to the oil pan. The spark plugs were removed. No mechanical damage was noted and the electrodes and posts exhibited a light, white ash coloration, which according to the Lycoming representative, was consistent with very lean operation(s). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe crankshaft was rotated by hand utilizing the ring gear. The crankshaft rotated freely and easily in both directions. \"Thumb\" compression was observed in proper order on all six cylinders. The valve train operated in proper order, and appeared free of any pre-mishap mechanical malfunction. Uniform lifting action was observed at each rocker assembly. Clean, uncontaminated oil was observed at all six rocker box areas. Mechanical continuity was established throughout the rotating group, valve train, and accessory section during hand rotation of the crankshaft.  &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe cylinder combustion chambers were examined through the spark plug holes using a lighted borescope. The combustion chambers remained mechanically undamaged, and there was no evidence of foreign object ingestion. The valves were intact and undamaged. There was no evidence of valve-to-piston-face contact. The piston faces all displayed a whitish coloration and the valve faces were white and orange, consistent with a lean operation. White residue/soot was seen throughout the remainder of the exhaust system. The sides of the piston heads were dark black in color and the rings displayed dark discoloration. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ignition harnesses from both magnetos to their respective spark plugs remained intact. The magnetos were secured to their respective mounting pads. The right magneto was timed at 20°; the left magneto was at 18°. Removal of the right magneto revealed that the bearing cage had broken; the broken piece was found in the oil sump. The magnetos were put on a test bench; the left magneto operated normally and the right magneto vibrated, but operated normally with even spark at each post. Both magnetos were rotated by hand and moved freely. It could not be determined the amount of vibration the engine would have been subjected to as a result of the  magneto bearing cage being broken. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotor Tachometer System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine compartment revealed that one magnet from the main rotor tachometer indicating system was separated from its housing on the yoke assembly; the magnet was located on the fuselage frame near the firewall. Both the housings showed a color consistent with a dark residue and a yellow/orange mark was on both housings and senders. (see figure 5 below.) The yoke assembly was not damaged. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5: Magnet Housing on Yoke Assembly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Transportation Safety Board Materials Laboratory completed an examination of the yoke, magnet assembly, and senders. Examination of the damaged magnet housing revealed that the deformation and fracture to the magnet housing was not consistent with that of impact directly with the magnet housing body. The fractured side exhibited deformation consistent with an object pushing from the inside of the housing radially outwards through the cylindrical wall. The intact side of the magnet housing did not exhibit deformation or contain any witness marks consistent with a strike. Deformation was also observed in the magnet housing perpendicular to its direction of motion, consistent with an internal force pushing through the magnet housing side wall. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was orange residue in a shape consistent with a circular outline on the exterior of the magnet housing’s cylindrical wall. (see figures 6 and 7 below.) There were additional areas on the open end of the magnet housing’s cylindrical wall and on the yoke body where a brownish/amber colored residue was present. The residue had a brittle response when scraped with a tool and was sent for analysis. There were areas of plastic deformation resembling a smearing-like movement of material further inside the interior of the cylindrical wall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 6: Magnet Assemblies on the Yoke&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 7: Magnet Housing&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Hall effect sensors exhibited some witness marks consistent with contact with a moving object. These contact marks exhibited plastic deformation in a direction consistent with the intended movement between the magnets and the faces of the Hall effect sensors. (see figure 8 below.) The contact damage extended 0.025 down from the face of the sensor. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nFigure 8: Sensor Damage&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRobinson issued a Service Bulletin in 2013 (SB-86) for securing the magnets into the housing, requiring the use of Loctite® 271 adhesive. Samples of the brown residue was gathered by the NTSB Materials Laboratory for comparison to a sample of uncured Loctite® 271. Despite not being a match, the differences in spectrum of the unknown material were likely a result of curing and aging/degradation of the material, particularly the loss of spectral peak intensity. A sample was additionally compared to a Robinson-provided exemplar magnet housing with dried adhesive. This residue on the accident part was either a similar material or a degraded sample of the exemplar material. A spectral library search was done on the accident spectrum and no other strong match was found.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe material found on the outside of the exemplar fitting was a strong match for the uncured Loctite sample. The uncured sample recovered from the outside of the exemplar fitting differed from the cured exemplar sample consistent with the significant change the Loctite material underwent during curing.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe orange material on the surface appeared to be paint, consistent with the Service Bulletin requirement that a mechanic place a yellow marker displaying that the Service Bulletin to add the adhesive was completed. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The two helicopters were performing deer netting operations. One helicopter was designated as a “spotter” and relayed the location of deer to the crew of the “gunner” helicopter, which then captured the deer using a gun net. The pilot of the gunner helicopter stated that the pilot of the spotter helicopter identified a deer and notified him of its location. The gunner helicopter was about 50 ft above and 100 ft behind the spotter helicopter as the gunner pilot began maneuvering toward the right and descending to capture the deer. The spotter helicopter initially turned left, then turned right again, and the spotter helicopter’s main rotor impacted the gunner helicopter’s skid and engine area, which sustained substantial damage. The spotter helicopter descended into terrain and was destroyed; the pilot and passenger onboard were fatally injured. The gunner pilot performed an emergency landing; the passenger onboard sustained serious injuries, and the pilot was not injured. Examination of both helicopters did not reveal any preimpact anomalies. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing of specimens from the spotter pilot identified ethanol, two prescription opioid medications, and an antidepression medication. The measured ethanol levels were consistent with an impairing blood alcohol level well above the 0.04 g/dL regulatory limit. On its own, the ethanol level was high enough to interfere with tracking, coordination, reaction, and traffic separation tasks. Use of the prescription opioid medications, in addition to alcohol, was likely more impairing than from the use of alcohol alone. The pilot’s autopsy did reveal an intact brain aneurysm, but, as it was intact, it was unlikely to contribute to impairment.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on the available information, the circumstances of the accident are consistent with the failure of the spotter helicopter pilot to maintain clearance from the gunner helicopter while maneuvering. It is likely that the impairing effects from a combination of alcohol and two opioid drugs contributed to the accident.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "On October 23, 2019, about 0846 central daylight time, two Robinson R22 helicopters, N7189D and N74512, were involved in an accident near Hebbronville, Texas. N7189D was destroyed and the pilot and passenger onboard were fatally injured. N74512 was substantially damaged; the pilot was not injured, and the passenger sustained serious injuries. The helicopters were operated as Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 work use flights.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flights was to identify and net deer. N7189D was operating as the “spotter” helicopter and was tasked with locating deer to capture and communicating the location to the gunner helicopter (N74512), which then captured the deer using a net gun. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter performing netting operations, the pilot of the gunner helicopter left the area to reload their net supply before returning to the operating area, where the pilot of the spotter helicopter had observed a doe. The gunner pilot flew to the area near the spotter helicopter and communicated via radio that he had the doe in sight. The gunner pilot estimated that he was about 100 ft above ground level (agl) about 100 ft behind the spotter helicopter, which was about 50 ft agl and about 100 ft behind the spotter helicopter. The gunner helicopter turned right and descended toward the doe while the spotter helicopter turned left and announced over the radio that he had spotted another deer. Shortly after, the gunner pilot felt an impact and brought his helicopter to a hover. He then saw the spotter helicopter descend and impact terrain. The gun operator onboard the gunner helicopter reported that their helicopter’s skids had separated. The gunner pilot then performed an emergency landing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo witnesses on the ground were participating in the recovery of the netted deer and saw the impact sequence. Both witnesses were equipped with radios to listen to the pilots. They stated that, after the gunner pilot radioed that he had the doe in sight, the helicopter turned right. The spotter helicopter initially turned to the left, then banked back to the right and collided with the gunner helicopter.&#x0D;\n - An autopsy was conducted on the spotter pilot by the County of Nueces, Office of the Medical Examiner. The autopsy ruled the cause of death to be the result of blunt force trauma and noted the presence of an intact saccular berry aneurysm in the pilot’s brain. Testing conducted by the Medical Examiner found the presence of codeine at 18.9 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), ethanol at 0.088 grams per deciliter (g/dL), and tramadol at 188 ng/mL. In addition, caffeine, nicotine, and cotinine were detected. &#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory performed toxicology testing on specimens from the pilot. Specimens were positive for the following substances:&#x0D;\n•\tEthanol – 101 mg/dL blood (subclavian), 104 mg/dL vitreous, 121 md/dL urine&#x0D;\n•\tMethanol – detected in blood, vitreous, and urine&#x0D;\n•\tCodeine – 7 mg/dL urine, 20 ng/mL blood, 7,279 ng/mL urine&#x0D;\n•\tMorphine – negative in blood, 1,226 ng/mL urine&#x0D;\n•\tTramadol – 220 ng/mL blood, negative in urine&#x0D;\n•\tDesmethyltramadol – detected in blood and urine&#x0D;\n•\tCitalopram – detected in blood, inconclusive in urine&#x0D;\n•\tN- desmethylcitalopram – detected in blood and urine&#x0D;\n•\tAcetaminophen – detected in blood and urine&#x0D;\n•\tRanitidine – detected in blood and urine&#x0D;\nEthanol is the intoxicating alcohol in beer, wine, and liquor. It can impair judgment, psychomotor performance, cognition, and vigilance, and at high enough levels can cause diminished consciousness and death. Codeine is an opiate used by itself or in combination with acetaminophen or similar products for the management of mild pain. It is habit forming and may impair mental and/or physical abilities to perform potentially hazardous tasks such as flying. Tramadol is a narcotic analgesic and carries a warning that it can impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks; desmethyltramadol is its active metabolite. Citalopram is an atypical antidepressant in the group of drugs known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; N-desmethylcitalopram is its active metabolite. This drug can also impair mental and/or physical abilities. Ranitidine is an antihistamine used in the treatment of excessive acid secretion from the stomach.&#x0D;\n - Spotter Pilot&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe spotter pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a rating for rotorcraft-helicopter. On his most recent application for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate, dated May 24, 2019, he reported 11,000 total hours of flight experience, and about 450 hours in the preceding 6 months.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGunner Pilot&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe gunner pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating and a flight instructor certificate with a rating for rotorcraft-helicopter. He reported 35,471 total hours of flight experience with about 6,500 hours in the accident helicopter make and model.&#x0D;\n - The spotter helicopter came to rest in a field containing scrub brush and mesquite trees, on a magnetic heading of 268°, at an elevation of 580 ft mean sea level (msl). The helicopter impacted the ground in a flat, slight left-side low attitude. The main wreckage included the main rotor, tail rotor, fuselage, tail boom, and skids. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot of the gunner helicopter performed a landing on an adjacent roadway. The helicopter came to rest on a magnetic heading of 267° at an elevation of 570 ft msl. The helicopter was intact, with exception of separated skids and displaced lower frames. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blades of the spotter helicopter contacted the skids of the descending gunner helicopter. Multiple breaks in the gunner helicopter’s skids were found on left skid, cross tube assembly, and right skid. In addition, the lower frame assembly near the engine was also damaged. &#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was conducting an aerial application flight in the helicopter. During the relocation flight from the previous site, the pilot overflew the application area and a powerline before landing on a truck near the northwest end of the field to refill the helicopter’s chemical reservoir. A witness described a normal liftoff and departure from the truck. The helicopter proceeded north along the west side of the field before turning south, then he heard a “pop” that he attributed to the helicopter striking a powerline wire before he saw the helicopter descend and impact the field. Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed that a section of a nearby powerline was entangled with the main and tail rotor drive systems, consistent with the helicopter having struck those wires. &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Spray Information/GPS Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an AGNAV GUIA Platinum P771 cockpit display recorded data about three times per second and recorded a portion of the accident flight. The device stopped recording about 35 to 40 seconds before the helicopter impacted the electrical wire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, “The incident could have been prevented with more thorough field recon” and “more eyes on the site prior to the aircraft arriving.” He also stated that relaying better information to the pilot about the ground conditions could have prevented the accident.&#x0D;\n - On October 17, 2019, about 1538 eastern daylight time, a Bell 206B Helicopter, N167AG, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near New Salem, North Carolina. The commercial pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 local aerial agricultural application flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator’s lead ground crew member for the spraying missions on the day of the accident, the pilot performed a preflight inspection of the helicopter about 0745 at their local base. After completing a total of 21 spraying loads at the other locations, the team transitioned to the field where the accident occurred. The ground support truck arrived first and was staged near the northwest corner of the field. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ground crew member reported that the helicopter approached the area from the north, overflew the field to be sprayed, then landed on the truck to refill the chemical reservoir. After refilling, he dispatched the helicopter using hand signals. He reported that the helicopter departed to the north, turned left to a southerly heading, and flew along the west side of the field. Shortly thereafter, he heard a pop that he attributed to a [powerline] wire breaking, then he turned around and saw the helicopter travel about 30 yards before impacting the ground.&#x0D;\n - An Autopsy of the pilot was performed by the Mecklenburg County Medical Examiner’s Office, Charlotte, North Carolina, the pilot's cause of death was blunt trauma injuries of the head and neck. &#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory detected no carbon monoxide, volatiles, or drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n - Examination of the accident site area revealed damage to powerlines that were oriented south to north. (see Figure 1.) The helicopter was on a north-northwest heading when it struck the wire between poles 1 and 2, near pole 2. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 – Accident location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on its right side, nose low, oriented on a heading of 351°. All major components were located with the main wreckage, with the exception of two pieces. (1) a 9’ 5” section of one rotor blade was located 123 feet to the southwest of the main wreckage. (2) a 12-inch section of the vertical stabilizer was located 198 feet south/southeast of the main wreckage, directly below the wire path between pole 1 and pole 2. The main rotor mast was fractured about 2 inches below the bottom of the hub. The hub and blades were located about 5 feet to the west side of the main wreckage with both blade grips attached and about 3 feet of each blade intact. The left side horizontal stabilizer was fractured from the tail boom and was found next to the tail rotor hub and blade assembly. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA section of powerline wire ran from the nose of the helicopter over the top of the cockpit, and about three rotations were wrapped around the main rotor mast and entangled in the spray system. About five rotations of wire were wrapped around the tail rotor hub and blade assembly. The fuel tank bladder remained in place but was breached. The debris field was on a heading of 339° from the vertical stabilizer to the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control system continuity was established from the pilot side cyclic and collective controls through the push-pull control tubes to the three hydraulic servo actuators. Continuity was confirmed from the servos through overload breaks in the control tubes to the swashplate assembly on the main rotor mast. The blade pitch change links remained attached at both ends and were fractured consistent with overload. Control continuity was established from the anti-torque pedals to the tail rotor hub and blade assembly. The tail rotor blade pitch change links remained intact and attached. Examination of the throttle linkage confirmed throttle continuity to the engine. The copilot side cyclic and collective controls were not installed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the engine, which remained attached to the engine mounts, revealed damage to the compressor air inlet. The compressor blades could not be rotated by hand, and rotational scoring was observed on the top of the air inlet housing.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe main gearbox was found rotated aft about 45°, and the engine to transmission drive shaft was pulled from the main gear box attachment fitting. The main gear box was repositioned upright, and the mast rotated freely by hand. The aft end of the engine to transmission shaft remained attached to the engine reduction gear box. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor shaft was fractured just forward of the horizontal stabilizer. The shaft remained attached to the engine reduction gear box and showed rotational scoring just forward of the fracture. When the tail rotor shaft was rotated, the freewheeling unit engaged, and when it was rotated in the opposite direction, it turned freely. The shaft aft of the fracture was continuous to the tail rotor gear box, which turned freely when rotated by hand.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The noncertificated pilot was conducting taxi operations in a gyrocopter at the airport. A witness near the airport stated that the aircraft became airborne and then turned and descended rapidly. A second witness near the airport stated that he heard the engine running and then quit suddenly, with no sputtering. A third witness heard the impact and saw smoke rising from the field.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blade had separated at the shaft near the main rotor hub and was one of the first pieces of wreckage located within the ground scar. The flywheel contained dirt and debris embedded on one side, consistent with a near vertical ground impact with no rotation of the main rotor. A postaccident engine examination revealed that all of the crankshaft bearings were seized in place and that a foreign substance in all bearings was congealed, consistent with exposure to high heat. When the engine case was separated, circumferential scarring was present on both sides of the case corresponding to the No. 1 (most forward) bearing, consistent with a spun bearing and lack of oil around the bearing journal It is likely that, based upon these findings, the engine seized in flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo maintenance records were located during the investigation. Additionally, the previous owner had not started the engine or performed any maintenance on it. A photograph that the previous owner provided showed the tachometer displaying 122 hours about 5 months before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the engine maintenance manual, a 100-hour inspection should include, among other tasks, an inspection of the cylinder head and piston crown and an inspection of the piston rings for movement. A general overhaul of the engine was to be completed every 5 years or 300 hours, whichever came first. Based upon the serial number, the engine was produced in 2002.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGiven the findings from the engine examination and the statements from the previous owner, it is unlikely that the engine had ever been overhauled or inspected in accordance with the engine maintenance manual. Had the required maintenance been performed, it is likely that the signs of a lubrication issue would have been revealed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther, the pilot's lack of flight experience in the aircraft likely contributed to the loss of control after the engine failure. The pilot’s logbooks indicated that he had logged less than 20 hours of total gyrocopter flight experience, of which only 3.5 hours occurred in 2019. It is likely, based upon this lack of experience, the pilot was not prepared for an engine failure to occur, and likely did not possess the aeronautical knowledge or skills required to appropriately respond to such an event, leading to a loss of control in flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to the FAA Rotorcraft Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21), “[f]or safe operation, you must be thoroughly familiar with he procedures and limitations for your particular aircraft along with other factors that may affect the safety of your flight.” It further states “By having a thorough knowledge of the gyroplane and its systems, you will be able to more readily handle the situation. In addition, by knowing the conditions which can lead to an emergency, many potential accidents can be avoided.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUnder a section titled Emergency Approach and Landing the handbook discusses that engine failures are possible, which necessitates planning and practicing emergency approaches and landings.&#x0D;\n - The gyrocopter was first issued a special airworthiness certificate on September 11, 2004. No records were located to determine the total flight hours on the aircraft at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aircraft was equipped with a Rotax 582 Mod 99 engine that was produced manufactured on August 20, 2002. No maintenance records for the aircraft were located during the investigation. Before the pilot owned the gyrocopter, it was owned by a museum. According to the museum sales director, while the aircraft was in their possession, the engine was never started and no maintenance was performed. A photograph that the museum provided of the tachometer, dated March 26, 2019, showed 122 hours. He also stated that the engine appeared new with no bluing or discoloration present on the exhaust.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Rotax Aircraft Engines maintenance manual, a 100-hour inspection should include, among other tasks, an inspection of the cylinder head and piston crown and an inspection of the piston rings for movement. A general overhaul of the engine was to be completed every 5 years or 300 hours, whichever came first.&#x0D;\n - On August 19, 2019, about 1834 central daylight time, an experimental light sport Sport Copter Vortex gyrocopter, N634SC, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident in Viroqua, Wisconsin. The noncertificated pilot was fatally injured. The aircraft was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight departed Viroqua Municipal Airport (Y51), Viroqua, Wisconsin, about 1830. According to a family member of the pilot, the purpose of the flight was to practice taxi operations at the airport and become familiar with the handling characteristics of the aircraft . A witness near the airport stated that she saw the aircraft become airborne but that it then turned and descended rapidly. A second witness near the airport stated that he heard the engine running and that it “sounded healthy” but then it quit suddenly, with no sputtering. A third witness heard the impact and saw smoke rising from the field. First responders found the gyrocopter fully engulfed in fire. &#x0D;\n - The pilot was issued a student pilot certificate on July 28, 2009, which would have expired July 31, 2014. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s most recent third-class Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate was issued February 1, 1999, with a limitation that the pilot must wear corrective lenses. The medical certificate was not valid for any class after February 28, 2001. No record was located of the pilot applying for BasicMed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the pilot's personal logbooks revealed that he first logged flight hours (1.5 hours) in a gyrocopter on October 7, 2015. In 2017, he logged 4.5 hours, in 2018 he logged 9.0 hours, and in 2019 he logged 3.5 hours, for a total of 18.5 flight hours in a gyrocopter.&#x0D;\n - The gyrocopter impacted a field about 0.31 nautical miles west of the departure end of runway 29 at Y51. The debris field was about 65 ft long and was aligned on a 336° magnetic heading.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blade had separated at the shaft near the main rotor hub and was one of the first pieces of wreckage located within the ground scar. The flywheel contained dirt and debris embedded on one side, consistent with a near vertical impact with no rotation of the main rotor. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the main rotor blade in the debris field was a separated portion of fiberglass propeller. Additional pieces were located along the path, consistent with pieces separating with each rotation of a cartwheel of the gyrocopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage came to rest against a row of corn and was largely consumed by a postaccident fire. The rudder remained attached at all attach points. The rudder cables were unbroken from the control surface to the rudder pedals, but movement could not be verified due to impact damage. The cabin structure was largely consumed by fire. The frame contained multiple fractures consistent with impact damage. Most fractures contained 45° shear lips, consistent with overstress fracture.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn engine examination revealed that the aft portion of the engine was damaged during impact, with about 6 inches of the aft portion of the engine case separated. Two of the spark plugs were absent of damage and confirmed tight before removal. The other two plugs were fractured about ½ of the length and found to be finger tight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn internal examination of the engine revealed that the No. 2 piston appeared deformed toward the forward edge of the cylinder and contained signatures consistent with high heat exposure. The No.1 cylinder and piston were removed and found to be unremarkable. When the No. 2 cylinder was removed, the piston rings were seized with vertical scarring present on the piston rings on one side. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the engine case was separated, circumferential scarring was present on both sides of the engine case corresponding to the No.1 (most forward) bearing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe substance in all bearings was congealed, consistent with exposure to high heat. See figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Congealed substance in each bearing &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Following several rounds in the helicopter airport traffic pattern, the flight instructor and student pilot performed hovering maneuvers on a taxiway designated for helicopter training. During one of the hovering maneuvers, the helicopter drifted away from the taxiway, over the grass area, and rapidly advanced towards a fence line. According to the student pilot, the flight instructor initiated a left turn, and the helicopter turned “very rapidly.” Analysis of a surveillance video indicated the helicopter rolled left about 70° as it neared the fence line. The helicopter’s bank angle decreased to about 40° as the helicopter continued to turn left. As the helicopter turned to a northern heading, the left roll angle increased to about 90°. The main rotor blades contacted the ground immediately after and the helicopter came to rest. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter revealed a punch tool at the aft bulkhead of the cabin resting against the tail rotor control bell crank. Testing performed by the helicopter manufacturer indicated the proximity of the punch to the tail rotor control bell crank could have inhibited some tail rotor control authority. However, as the examination did not reveal any other anomalies with the flight control system or powerplant, even if the pilot’s tail rotor authority was inhibited, he still had the authority to reduce engine power, lower the collective and land the helicopter at any moment during the flight. Further, the restricted tail rotor authority would not have affected the helicopter’s roll axis, and the rapid, steep roll angles that occurred moments before impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instructor and student pilot likely lost control of the helicopter during its final 90° left bank, but the cause of this and previous excessive bank angles and whether they were intended during the helicopter’s final movements could not be determined. The student pilot’s history with another flight instructor, of aggressive control inputs and lack of attention to the surrounding environment suggest that the instructor, in the accident, may have been forced to intervene and recover the helicopter. However, a lack of available evidence precluded the investigation from determining when this intervention occurred and whether it contributed to the accident.  &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "On July 15, 2019, about 1426 Pacific daylight time, a Robinson R-44 II helicopter, N144TG, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident at Hayward Executive Airport (HWD), Hayward, California. The flight instructor was fatally injured, and the student pilot was seriously injured. The airplane was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight. &#x0D;\nThe accident flight data was compiled from a combination of archived Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control (ATC) audio and radar data acquired from a commercially available third party. Following several rounds in the helicopter airport traffic pattern, the flight instructor and student pilot performed hovering maneuvers on a taxiway designated for helicopter training. At 1422, the instructor requested to takeoff, but ATC denied the request and asked the flight instructor to standby. &#x0D;\nGPS flight tracking data showed the helicopter continue to hover for several seconds before slowly maneuvering west and then entering a left turn over a patch of hard dirt and vegetation to the southwest of the taxiway. A surveillance video retrieved from an adjacent building that faced northeast captured the helicopter’s shadow during its final movements. The shadow of the helicopter entered the camera view from the left with its nose facing west. After a brief side hover to the left, in a southern direction, the helicopter performed a rapid turn to the southeast and its speed over the ground increased from about 2.5 mph to about 18 mph. In its final movements, the helicopter made a rapid turn to the north in a high bank angle on its left side and a cloud of dust was observed before the helicopter’s shadow disappeared from the camera view. Figure 1 is a flight path diagram compiled from both tracking data and the surveillance video. &#x0D;\nAccording to the student pilot, the accident occurred about 1 hour into the flight towards the end of their lesson. The instructor appeared calm and confident during the flight. Much of the instructional flight had consisted of flying a left-hand traffic pattern (the helicopter traffic pattern), takeoffs and landings, hovering, flying the taxiway and left and right turns. During the lesson, the instructor asked the student pilot to hover-taxi over the runway and then return to the yellow spot labeled as “C” in Figure 1. According to the student, the instructor would take the controls from him when the helicopter “was away from the taxiway over the grassy area.” In the last few minutes of the accident flight, they were hovering when the instructor took the controls and explained that the student pilot should keep his eyes on the horizon and “don’t look down.” The instructor then requested take-off clearance from ATC but was instructed to hold. He began a left turn, but the helicopter turned “very rapidly and pitched to the left.” The instructor made a right turn, and the student pilot observed the helicopter again “turn rapidly and also pitched to the right,” before impacting the ground. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Helicopter Flight Path&#x0D;\nA video study of the surveillance footage conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) showed the roll angle of the helicopter in the last few seconds before the helicopter impacted the ground. The helicopter’s actual height above the ground could not be determined. According to the analysis, once over the berm and on a southern heading, the helicopter rolled left about 70° as it neared a fence line. Immediately after, the helicopter’s roll angle decreased to about 40° as the helicopter continued to turn left. As the helicopter turned to a northern heading, the left roll angle increased to about 90°. The main rotor blades contacted the ground immediately after and the helicopter came to rest.  &#x0D;\n - According to the student pilot’s logbook, he began his flight training in July 2018 in the accident helicopter make and model. The flight instructor who taught the student pilot during this time stopped instructing him in December 2018. The instructor recounted that the student pilot progressed slower than his other students and observed him make an unnecessarily aggressive control input every few flight hours. During hover practice the student pilot would input too much right or left pedal and shift the helicopter in that direction. Most of the time the student pilot would correct the movements on his own, but occasionally he would not catch the improper movement and the instructor would intervene and remediate. &#x0D;\n -  According to the helicopter flight manual, the hydraulic system was comprised of a pump, three servos, a reservoir and interconnecting lines. Each part was removed from the accident helicopter, examined and tested at the manufacturer’s facility with oversight from an NTSB investigator. The right servo, left servo, aft servo, hydraulic pump and hydraulic reservoir all passed their respective acceptance test procedures. Inspection of the hoses that connected the control servos to the hydraulic system revealed a trace amount of dark particles, but the hoses were not obstructed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter manufacturer performed tests to determine if the punch tool, that was found beneath the tail rotor bell crank, would have interfered with bell crank travel. The testing revealed the punch could have inhibited left pedal input by up to 40%. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBank Angle&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21B), &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 30° of bank, the apparent increase in gross weight soars. At 30° of bank, or pitch, the apparent increase is only 16%, but at 60°, it is twice the load on the wings and rotor disk. For example, if the weight of the helicopter is 1,600 lbs, the weight supported by the rotor disk in a 30° bank at a constant altitude would be 1,856 pounds (1,600 + 16% (or 256)). In a 60° bank, it would be 2,300 pounds; in an 80° bank, it would be almost six times as much, or 8,000 pounds.&#x0D;\n - The helicopter came to rest on its left side, approximately 50 ft from taxiway Zulu at the top of an approximately 3-foot-tall berm. The main wreckage was comprised of most of the major sections of the helicopter and oriented on a heading of 052° magnetic. The first identified point of impact was a ground scar about 95 inches in length located 14 ft south of the main wreckage and was consistent with a main rotor blade impact. Several plexiglass fragments were found several feet forward of the cabin beyond the berm. Two ground scars were adjacent to the main wreckage and another ground scar was collocated with the main wreckage. A 2-foot-long section of main rotor blade tip came to rest about 250 ft southwest of the main wreckage on the roof of a building (see Figure 2).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2: Wreckage Diagram&#x0D;\nCyclic control movement was confirmed from the cockpit to the main rotor blades and collective control was verified from the collective to the main rotor blades through the swashplate. Both main rotor blade pitch change links were broken, but the fracture surfaces were consistent with overload separation. All three main rotor servos operated smoothly when the cyclic and collective were actuated by hand. The anti-torque pedals were crushed and could not be moved, but continuity of the anti-torque system was traced from the cockpit to the tail rotor through a separation at the bell crank.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor drive/output shaft rotated smoothly, and oil was present in the gearbox. The tail rotor drive/output shaft was continuous from the transmission to the tail rotor blades through a separation in the drive shaft at bay 2. The four V-belts were in good condition but had skipped one groove aft in the upper sheave and the V-belts on the lower sheave were displaced. Continuity of the main rotor and tail rotor drive systems were confirmed from the lower sheave to the main rotor blades through the main rotor drive shaft and from the upper sheave to the tail rotor blades through its respective drive shaft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth main rotor blades remained attached to the hub. One blade was bowed upward with several chordwise creases and wrinkle. A two-foot section of the blade tip was separated and displayed chordwise scuff marks along the leading edge of the blade. The spar was bent opposite the direction of rotation at the fracture.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe other main rotor blade displayed bending slightly downward and opposite the direction of rotation throughout the blade length, with multiple chordwise creases and wrinkles. The tip displayed chordwise scuff marks along the leading edge of the blade. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth tail rotor blades remained attached to the hub. One tail rotor blade displayed a chordwise wrinkle. Tree residue was observed on both the inboard and outboard skins on both tail rotor blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotational continuity was established throughout each of the six cylinders, when the crankshaft was rotated by hand using the engine-cooling fan, which showed intake and exhaust compression on each cylinder. The engine did not display evidence of a catastrophic internal failure. Both magnetos were intact and produced spark when tested. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter examination further identified a punch tool about 5 inches in length that was resting beneath the tail rotor control bell crank behind the aft bulkhead of the cabin.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The crew of the helicopter air ambulance flight was approaching the airport for landing in dark night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) after delivering a patient to the hospital. The reported weather conditions about the time the pilot initiated the instrument landing system (ILS) approach included 1/2-mile visibility with haze, which then deteriorated to 1/4 mile, which was within the operator's approved visibility approach minimums. The paramedic onboard reported that he saw the runway environment through a thin layer of fog as the helicopter descended toward the decision height (DH) of 200 ft above ground level during the approach. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter descending below the DH, with a power setting below 30% torque, the helicopter's pitch attitude increased from -3° (nose-down) to +20° (nose-up), its airspeed decreased from 100 to 50 knots, and the pilot declared a missed approach, likely due to a loss of visual contact with the runway environment. The pilot's increased collective input and the helicopter's decreasing airspeed resulted in an increase in torque, and the helicopter entered a right rotational yaw that accelerated into a spin. The helicopter subsequently impacted terrain near the runway. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe dark night conditions at the rural airport resulted in little to no visual references during the pilot's transition to landing and the attempted missed approach. It is likely that the pilot became spatially disoriented, which led to the excessive pitch attitude, slow airspeed, his failure to recognize and arrest the right yaw, and the subsequent loss of control.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Spatial Disorientation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3B) describes some hazards associated with flying when the ground or horizon are obscured. The handbook states, in part, the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe vestibular sense (motion sensing by the inner ear) in particular can and will confuse the pilot. Because of inertia, the sensory areas of the inner ear cannot detect slight changes in airplane attitude, nor can they accurately sense attitude changes that occur at a uniform rate over a period of time. On the other hand, false sensations are often generated, leading the pilot to believe the attitude of the airplane has changed when, in fact, it has not. These false sensations result in the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Instrument Approach Guidance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA guidance for helicopter instrument approaches allows a reduction of the Category A visibility by half, but in no case less than 1/4 statute mile or 1,200 ft runway visual range (RVR). The approach can be initiated at any speed up to the highest approach category authorized; however, the speed on the final approach segment must be reduced to the Category A speed of less than 90 knots before the missed approach point in order to apply the visibility reduction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOperator Training and Guidance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator's flight training and currency programs were all conducted inflight, as the only A109 simulator was based in Italy. Following a September 2016 accident that involved a loss of control during a missed approach in night IMC conditions, the operator started construction of a flight training device (FTD) for instrument procedures using an actual A109S cockpit. The FTD was not yet certified or in use at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the accident, the operator increased the minimum weather conditions required for their pilots to conduct an instrument approach to a cloud ceiling of 400 ft agl and 1 mile visibility. - The helicopter was equipped with a 2-axis autopilot for lateral (roll) and longitudinal (pitch) control. The autopilot provided for limited yaw dampening, but no yaw control. Minimum airspeed to comply with IFR handling quality requirements for the helicopter was 55 knots. - On June 28, 2019, about 0040 central daylight time, an Agusta Spa A109S helicopter, N11NM, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident at Brainerd Lakes Regional Airport (BRD), near Brainerd Lakes, Minnesota. The pilot and flight nurse were fatally injured, and the flight paramedic was seriously injured. The helicopter was operated by North Memorial Healthcare as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 helicopter air ambulance flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight was returning to BRD after delivering a patient to North Memorial Heliport (MY77), Robbinsdale, Minnesota. An onboard Appareo Vision 1000 device recorded flight data, cockpit imagery, and audio of the flight. The helicopter departed MY77 at 2348, and the pilot received an instrument flight rules clearance from air traffic control (ATC) to climb to 6,000 ft mean sea level (msl) and fly direct to BRD.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2356, while holding an iPad, the pilot stated on intercom to the paramedic and/or flight nurse that visibility at BRD was \"1 mile, looks good.\" The pilot requested the instrument landing system runway 23 (ILS RWY 23) approach and informed the controller that he had obtained the current weather at BRD.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0028, the pilot selected the BRD automated surface observing system (ASOS) frequency. The ASOS transmission included a ceiling of 200 ft above ground level (agl) and 1/4-mile visibility with fog. The controller cleared the helicopter for the ILS RWY 23 approach. Shortly thereafter, the ASOS-transmitted weather included 1/2-mile visibility with haze, and the pilot stated \"awesome, 1/2 we're legal\" on the intercom. The pilot subsequently activated the runway lights.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0034:35, the helicopter began a descent on the ILS glideslope with the autopilot coupled. About 5 seconds later, the pilot appeared to turn on the helicopter's landing light and/or search light.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0036:30, the helicopter passed the final approach fix (5.3 miles from Runway 23) at 93 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0036:37, the ASOS-transmitted weather included 1/4-mile visibility with haze and a sky condition of 200 ft vertical visibility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter arriving at the ILS decision height, the pilot selected the altitude hold mode on the flight director and about 1 second later, decoupled the autopilot (pitch and roll steering modes). The radar altimeter read 130 ft agl. Over the next 14 seconds, with a power setting below 30% torque, the helicopter's pitch increased from -3° (nose-down) to +20° (nose-up) and the radar altimeter increased to 230 ft agl. As airspeed decreased below 50 knots, the pilot selected vertical speed, and heading modes on the flight director. The helicopter's power increased rapidly through 40% torque and the airspeed decreased through 25 knots. Based on a GPS groundspeed of 40 knots, the airborne tailwind was about 15 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0039:38, the pilot announced a go-around. The helicopter's power increased past 80% torque, and the airspeed was 0 knots. The flight instruments indicated that the helicopter had entered a right rotational yaw and the radar altimeter read 300 ft agl. The helicopter's right yaw continued to increase; the power setting rose above 110% torque and the airspeed remained near 0 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe last recorded information, at 0039:57, indicated that the helicopter was about 100 ft agl. The power setting was below 30% torque and the pilot had selected the \"ALT\" (altitude hold) button on the flight director.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecorded images of the approach and attempted go-around did not provide a view of the runway environment or weather conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the accident, the flight paramedic (seated in the left forward seat) recalled that the runway lights and surface were visible below a thin fog layer during the approach. As the helicopter approached the runway, he noticed clouds to the side and recalled the pilot stating that the weather conditions were foggy and that a go-around was needed. The helicopter subsequently spun to the right and impacted the ground. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot and flight nurse by the Ramsey County Medical Examiner, St. Paul, Minnesota. The cause of death was multiple traumatic injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Forensic Sciences Laboratory performed toxicological testing on the pilot. The tests were negative for all screened-for drugs, carbon monoxide, and alcohol. - BRD was located in a rural area with few ground lights, and there was no moon illumination at the time of the accident. Airport personnel stated that several lakes near BRD would often generate patchy fog and visibility could vary significantly at different locations on the airport.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe BRD ASOS was located about 600 ft left of runway 23 and about 1,200 ft from the runway threshold. BRD did not have equipment to measure runway visual range (RVR) for the touchdown zone.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the ASOS reported wind from 040° at 5 knots, 1/4 statute mile visibility, haze, vertical visibility of 200 ft agl, temperature of 19°C and a dew point temperature of 17°C.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) valid for BRD about the accident time included wind from 020° at 4 knots, 1 1/2 statute miles visibility, haze, and a clear sky. An AIRMET advisory for instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions was valid at the accident time. - The pilot's most recent Part 135 competency/proficiency check occurred on March 12, 2019. During the 90 days before the accident, the pilot logged 27 landings at night, 16 instrument approaches, 1 flight hour of actual instrument time, and 57 hours of simulated instrument time. The pilot's total actual instrument time flown was 41 hours. - The FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) reviewed the helicopter's seats, restraints, and helmet specifications and the effects of the impact with terrain at a high vertical velocity. No anomalies were noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator's communication center first attempted radio contact with the helicopter crew about 15 minutes after the accident and the paramedic made a mayday radio transmission about 22 minutes after the accident. Emergency response personnel located the helicopter about 41 minutes after the accident. The low-visibility weather conditions contributed to the delayed arrival of first responders.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA did not require that the operator have an operational control center (OCC). Following the accident, the operator made communication center training and process improvements, including timely identification of an aircraft potentially in distress. - The helicopter impacted a grassy area south of runway 23 and came to rest upright and nearly intact on a heading of 074°. The main fuselage and tail boom exhibited crushing consistent with a high-velocity vertical descent and impact. (See Figure 1.) The helicopter was upright and nearly intact, with no movement from the initial impact point. There was no evidence of a postcrash fire. The ground adjacent to the wreckage was soaked with fuel and the smell of fuel was present at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. View of Helicopter at Accident Site&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter and review of recorded flight information revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot of the helicopter was conducting a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country flight from which he failed to return as planned. Radar data depicted the helicopter about 375 ft above ground level and 117 knots with no sudden airspeed or altitude diversions before it impacted an island hillside. The wreckage was located the following day, significantly fragmented and consumed by a postimpact fire. Ground scars and the wreckage distribution were consistent with collision with terrain in a level flight attitude. There was no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter.&#x0D;\nReview of weather information supported instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) over the area of the accident site and an environment conducive to cloud development below 1,000 ft mean sea level. Satellite data showed that, during the accident timeframe, the northwestern part of the island (where the accident site was located) was affected by cloud cover, although most of the rest of the island was not, or the cloud coverage was not as extensive. The weather information that the pilot may have accessed before the flight could not be determined; however, reports available to him likely depicted higher cloud bases than those present over the accident site at the time of the accident. A first responder reported that low ceilings and visibility were common for the area for that time of year, and typically formed in the early evening hours and persisted overnight into the morning.&#x0D;\nThe circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot’s continued VFR flight into a localized area of IMC, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain. &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "On June 17, 2019, about 1713 Pacific daylight time, a Robinson R44 helicopter, N7187D, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Two Harbors, Santa Catalina Island, California. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an Alert Notice (ALNOT) for the accident helicopter when a family member reported that the pilot had failed to return as planned. Local law enforcement commenced search and rescue operations throughout the northern area of Santa Catalina Island and the wreckage was located the following morning.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of radar data revealed that the pilot departed from John Wayne/Orange County Airport (SNA), Santa Ana, California, at 1632, and flew toward Zamperini Field Airport (TOA), Torrance, California, where he flew once around the airport traffic pattern. He then continued in a southwest direction toward Santa Catalina Island while gradually climbing to 1,900 ft mean sea level (msl) and maintaining a speed of about 110 knots (+/- 5 knots). The data did not reveal any extreme changes in pitch, bank, or airspeed. At 1710, the helicopter started a slow descent to about 1,700 ft while maintaining about 110 knots. The last radar return, at 1713, depicted the helicopter at 1,475 ft msl (about 375 ft above ground level) and 117 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA first responder who arrived at the accident site by helicopter the morning after the accident reported that the sky was overcast with a low ceiling and low visibility. He also stated that that this was a common weather pattern for the area in the month of June, and that typically, “the ceiling drops in the early evening and remains until approximately 0900 in the morning.” &#x0D;\n - County of Los Angeles Medical Examiner’s Office performed an autopsy of the pilot. The autopsy report stated that the cause of death was due to \"blunt trauma.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA’s Forensic Sciences Laboratory conducted toxicology tests on specimens from the pilot. The results were negative for all tests performed.&#x0D;\n - Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-17 imagery data identified cloudy conditions across the accident region, including over the northwest portion of Santa Catalina Island, where the accident occurred; however, much of the rest of the island was not under cloud cover during this timeframe. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model for the area of the accident site at 1700, revealed a temperature inversion between about 2,000 and 4,400 ft msl. The relative humidity was greater than 90% below 2,400 ft, and the Rawinsonde Observation Program (RAOB) projected broken cloud conditions from about 500 ft through 2,100 ft msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn AIRMET advisory for instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions was active for the accident location at the accident time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Graphical Forecasts for Aviation (GFA) imagery, which was issued about 1500 and valid until 1700, depicted few to scattered sky conditions over the accident site. Cloud bases and tops immediately to the west of the accident site were overcast at 1,000 ft and 3,500 ft msl respectively. Additionally, an AIRMET for mountain obscuration was identified to the east of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt is not known if the pilot reviewed the weather prior to the accident flight; however, METARs available to him reported much higher cloud bases than what existed over the accident site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor additional information, refer to the NTSB Weather Study, which is appended to the docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n - The wreckage was located about 2 miles southeast of the northern tip of Catalina Island. It came to rest about 860 ft north of an east-west oriented ridgeline at an elevation about 1,293 ft msl. The linear debris path extended uphill from the initial impact point on a heading of about 124° magnetic and was about 70 ft in length. All major components of the helicopter were located at the accident site. The wreckage was significantly fragmented and consumed by a postimpact fire. Continuity from the cockpit controls to the main and tail rotor systems could not be confirmed due to impact and fire damage; however, all control rod ends were found in the wreckage path. The initial impact point comprised disrupted dirt on the far northern end of the debris field. Two nearly parallel indentations in the vegetation and dirt, spaced about one foot apart, were consistent with both main rotor blades contacting terrain while still rotating. The shape of the disrupted dirt and the airframe debris found within and around the initial impact site indicated that the helicopter was in a level attitude at impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe empennage was located about 20 ft from the initial impact point and was impact damaged. The tailrotor (TR) gearbox was separated from the tailboom and one TR blade remained attached to the gearbox. The other TR blade was separated and located nearby.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage comprised the fuselage, tailboom, engine, and the main rotor (MR) blade assembly. One MR blade was separated from the mast; the outboard portion of the other MR blade was located at the adjacent hill about 240 ft east of the main wreckage. The engine had separated from the airframe upon impact. Crankshaft rotation was precluded due to impact and thermal damage. The top spark plugs electrodes remained mechanically undamaged and displayed varying coloration attributed to thermal effects of the postimpact fire. The combustion chambers and bottom spark plug electrodes of all six cylinders remained mechanically undamaged, and there was no evidence of foreign object ingestion. The valves were intact and undamaged. The ignition harness remained attached at each spark plug lead. The carburetor was separated from the engine and examined. The fuel bowl remained free of visible preimpact contaminants, and the float assembly remained secure at the mounting and free of damage. The heat-damaged float pontoons exhibited no evidence of rubbing against the wall of the bowl. The fuel inlet screen was found properly installed and free of contamination. Both magnetos sustained postimpact and thermal energy damage and could not be functionally tested.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter holes were drilled through the top of the engine case, the engine was examined internally with a borescope. There was no evidence of lubrication deprivation. The crankshaft and attached connecting rods remained free of heat distress. The camshaft was intact and each of the camshaft lobes exhibited their characteristic elliptical shape.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no evidence of mechanical malfunction or failure with the engine or the airframe that would have precluded normal operation. Detailed examination reports of the accident site and the engine are available in the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "After dropping off a passenger during a routine weekly commuting flight, the noninstrument-rated pilot of the helicopter remained at the fixed-base operator (FBO) for about 2 hours, reviewing weather information before departing on the planned repositioning flight, which was the last flight leg of the commute. Before he departed, the pilot informed FBO staff that he saw a “twenty-minute window to make it out.” Had the pilot remained at the heliport, the helicopter owner would have incurred hourly, overnight, and landing fees depending on the length of stay. The extent to which those fees or other factors, such as the pilot’s obligation to reposition the helicopter as part of the normal commute, influenced his decision to depart could not be determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot departed into marginal visual flight rules (MVFR) conditions, and soon after takeoff, encountered instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Although the pilot communicated that he was attempting to return to the departure heliport; shortly thereafter, he transmitted to heliport staff that he “didn’t know where he was.” Flight track data depicted an erratic flight path after takeoff, during which the helicopter climbed above the reported cloud base of 500 ft above ground level, and witness video recordings showed the helicopter flying in and out of clouds. About 8 minutes after takeoff, the helicopter descended rapidly and impacted the roof of a building. Examination of the airframe and engines revealed no evidence of any preimpact anomalies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s decision to depart into MVFR conditions and the helicopter’s subsequent encounter with IMC were conducive to the development of spatial disorientation, and the helicopter’s erratic flight path and rapid descent were consistent with a loss of control due to spatial disorientation.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn June 10, 2019, about 1340 eastern daylight time, an Agusta A109E helicopter, N200BK, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near New York, New York. The commercial pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 corporate flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight departed from the East 34th street heliport (6N5), New York, New York, about 1330 and was destined for Linden Airport (LDJ), Linden, New Jersey. On the morning of the accident, the pilot and a pilot-rated passenger departed Bel-Aire Farms Heliport (NY46), Amenia, New York, about 1030. They stopped briefly at Hudson Valley Regional Airport (POU), Poughkeepsie, New York, for fuel, then flew to 6N5, arriving about 1130. According to the pilot-rated passenger, the flight was uneventful. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPersonnel at the fixed-base-operator (FBO) at 6N5 reported that the pilot-rated passenger was at the controls as the helicopter landed. He departed the heliport by car, while the pilot remained at 6N5. The pilot waited in the lounge for about two hours. While there, he was continuously checking weather conditions using his tablet computer. Before departing, he mentioned to the staff that he saw a “twenty-minute window to make it out.” The helicopter departed 6N5 about 1332. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of automatic dependent surveillance - broadcast (ADS-B) data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that the helicopter departed and initially flew south over the East River before changing course northward. About 5 to 7 minutes after departure, the pilot contacted the FBO and requested to return to the heliport. He was advised to land on pad No. 4. The pilot then radioed that he “did not know where he was.” The helicopter flew erratically over the East River, changed course and altitude several times before making a 270° turn, which approached 6N5 from the west. About 500 ft west of 6N5, at an altitude of 600 to 700 ft mean sea level (msl), the helicopter reversed course and flew erratically over Manhattan before impacting the roof of a 54-story building at 787 7th Avenue. The last recorded position of the helicopter was about 0.1 nautical mile southeast of the building at an altitude of about 1,570 ft msl. The overall height of the building above the street was about 790 ft msl, with the roof section where the helicopter came to rest (below the exterior walls and catwalks surrounding the perimeter of the roof), about 765 ft msl. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 - Helicopter Ground Track&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness provided video of a portion of the flight as the helicopter was flying in and out of clouds. The helicopter descended rapidly from the clouds in a nose-down pitch attitude and appeared to initially transition to a level pitch attitude before climbing into the overcast cloud ceiling and out of view. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA airman records, the pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating, which was issued on September 24, 2004. He also held a flight instructor certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating, which was issued on June 20, 2018. He did not hold an instrument rating. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on May 15, 2019, at which time he reported 2,805 total hours flight experience. The pilot received initial and recurrent training from the helicopter manufacturer in April 2015 and June 2016, respectively. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had been employed by the company that operated the helicopter (owned by the pilot-rated passenger) for about five years. The flight was part of a normal weekly commute which typically began on Mondays with a flight from Amenia, New York, to 6N5, where the passenger would disembark. The pilot would normally then reposition the helicopter from 6N5 to LDJ, where the helicopter would remain for the week. The commute was typically reversed on Fridays, when the pilot would fly the helicopter from LDJ to 6N5, pick up the passenger, and return to Amenia, New York. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe twin-engine, 7-seat helicopter was manufactured in 2000. It was equipped with two 549-horsepower, Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW206C engines. The most recent documented inspection was completed on May 21, 2019, which was a 50 hour/30-day inspection. At that time, the helicopter had accrued a total of 3,939 flight hours. Both engines had accrued about 570 hours since overhaul. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1351, the weather conditions at a reporting station located in Central Park, about 1 mile northeast of the accident site at an elevation of 156 ft msl, included an overcast ceiling at 500 ft above ground level (agl), visibility 1.25 statute miles (sm) in rain and mist, temperature 18°C, dew point 17°C, wind from 070° at 8 knots, and an altimeter setting of 30.05 inches of mercury. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a subscription to a commercial weather service provider. A review of records from the provider revealed that the pilot had accessed “airport information” while he was on the ground at 6N5 from several airports in the area and along the route of flight from 6N5 to LDJ. Although the records did not indicate specifically what information he may have accessed or viewed, weather observations are among the information available from the inquiries. Two of the airports accessed were Downtown Manhattan/Wall St Heliport (JRB), located about 3 nautical miles southwest of 6N5, and the destination airport, LDJ.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1256, the observation at JRB included visibility of 2.5 statute miles in mist with an overcast ceiling of 800 ft agl. At the time of the pilot’s last inquiry at 1323, the most recent observation at JRB (at 1314) included visibility of 4 sm and an overcast ceiling of 1,000 ft agl. At 1324, after the pilot’s last inquiry, the visibility at JRB reduced to 1.75 sm in mist. At the time of the pilot’s inquiry about LDJ at 1324, the most recent observation available (1315) included visibility 2.5 sm and an overcast ceiling of 600 ft agl. For more information, refer to the weather study report in the public docket for this accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage on the rooftop revealed that all major components of the helicopter were present at the accident site and were confined to an area about 100 ft long and 20 ft wide, oriented on a heading of about 300° magnetic. Small pieces of debris were recovered from the 50th floor level and street level. The helicopter was severely fragmented and partially consumed by a post-impact fire. All four main rotor blades were fragmented. Remnants of two main rotor blades remained attached to the rotor hub, the other two blades were separated from the hub. All exhibited leading edge damage. The main rotor gearbox was impact damaged, partially fragmented, and could not be turned by hand. The tail rotor blades, hub, and gearbox remained largely intact. One tail rotor blade exhibited a leading edge gouge; the other blade tip was fracture-separated and exhibited thermal damage. The tail rotor driveshaft was fractured in several locations; an 8-ft section remained attached to the tail rotor gearbox. The tail rotor shaft and blades rotated freely when turned by hand. While most of the flight control components were identified, flight control continuity could not be established due to impact damage and extreme fragmentation of the airframe. All three landing gear actuators were in the down position. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left engine was broken into two sections at the reduction gearbox. The compressor impeller rotated freely by hand. Several blades exhibited leading edge damage and several blade tips were bent in the direction opposite of rotation. The power turbine shaft was fractured, consistent with overload, and exhibited twisting features and rotational scoring. The fuel management module was damaged, separated from the engine control gearbox, and its control lever was oriented in the “flight” position. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right engine was mostly intact and exhibited thermal damage. The compressor impeller would not rotate; its blades exhibited leading edge damage and were not bent. Debris was found ingested downstream of the compressor discharge area. The driveshaft between the right engine and the main gearbox was fracture-separated in a twisted pattern. The fuel management module was damaged, partially separated from the engine control gearbox, and its control was oriented in the “flight” position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe throttle quadrant was found loose and separated from its mount. The control cable ends were not found. Although both levers were found in the “MAX” position, their position at the time of impact could not be confirmed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the two attitude-direction indicator gyroscope instruments revealed indications of about 50-80° nose down, and about 80-120° left roll. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot’s girlfriend, during the evening before and on the day of the accident, the pilot was concerned about the weather for the flight from Amenia to 6N5, and from 6N5 to LDJ. As the pilot was preparing the helicopter for the flight from Amenia, he informed his brother that he was nervous about the flight due to the poor weather conditions. His brother suggested that he not fly the trip, the pilot responded that “[the pilot-rated passenger] is making me fly.” About 1200, during a telephone conversation while at 6N5, the pilot told his girlfriend that he had a “window” to reposition the helicopter to LDJ, and also said that he “shouldn’t be flying, but had to…” &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to staff at the FBO at 6N5, fees that would have been incurred for the helicopter to remain at 6N5 started at $200 per hour, with an overnight fee of $250, plus a landing fee.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and three passengers departed on a local sightseeing flight at a music festival. The helicopter impacted a densely wooded area and came to rest between trees on its right side. The surviving passenger stated to the media that the helicopter’s engine made sounds “like your car does when it runs out of fuel.”  &#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter at the accident site indicated evidence of main rotor blade rotation; however, damage to the engine drive system did not reveal evidence of engine power at the time of impact. Additionally, the oil pressure warning light bulb filament was found stretched consistent with illumination at the time of impact, which according to the helicopter’s operating handbook, may be one indication of a loss of engine power. About 5 gallons of fuel was drained from the helicopter following the accident, with no evidence of fuel contamination. Examination of the airframe, flight controls, and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter’s most recent inspection was a combined 2,200 hour overhaul, 100-hour, and annual inspection, completed on May 6, 2019. As part of this inspection, the engine was removed, overhauled, and reinstalled on the helicopter. &#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter’s type certificate data sheet, the unusable fuel quantity was 1 gallon.&#x0D;\nR44 Emergency Procedures&#x0D;\nThe pilot operating handbook for the helicopter, Section 3, Emergency Procedures, Power Failure – General, stated that an engine failure may be indicated by a change in noise level, nose left yaw, an oil pressure light, or decreasing engine rpm. &#x0D;\n - On June 2, 2019, about 1950 central daylight time, a Robinson R44 II helicopter, N41351, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Cass, Arkansas. The pilot and two passengers were fatally injured, and one passenger survived with serious injuries. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 sightseeing flight. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter flew passengers from a local music festival over the densely wooded area to the south of the performance arena. The helicopter was reported overdue and was located by search and rescue crews in a densely wooded area of the Ozark National Forest. There were no witnesses to the accident. &#x0D;\nA witness recalled seeing the helicopter while camping at the music festival. He saw the helicopter flying in an area different from the previous flights. He saw the helicopter’s nose pitch “dramatically” up. The helicopter climbed and then its climb stopped, sliding backwards tail first before the nose of the helicopter pitched rapidly down. The helicopter then entered a right turn and descended out of his view. He did not witness an impact and did not know about the accident until after viewing news reports. It is unknown if this was the accident sequence or if he witnessed a previous flight.&#x0D;\nThe survivor of the accident was unable to provide a statement to investigators. During media interviews he stated that “the helicopter started chugging like your car does when it runs out of fuel. The engine cut and we started dropping.”&#x0D;\nA review of Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) information captured numerous sporadic points of multiple flights flown on the day of the accident. The last recorded points captured the helicopter in a left turn about 200-300 ft above ground level at a groundspeed between 55 and 70 knots. The final point was about 250 yards from the accident site.&#x0D;\n - An autopsy was conducted on the pilot by the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory. The cause of death was multiple injuries and the manner of death was ruled an accident. &#x0D;\nToxicology testing was conducted by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory. Testing was negative for carbon monoxide, cyanide, and ethanol. Hydroxychloroquine was detected in blood and in the liver.&#x0D;\n - The pilot’s logbooks were not available for review. On his most recent application for a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate, dated December 19, 2018, the pilot reported 5,000 total hours of flight experience with 200 hours in the preceding 6 months.&#x0D;\n - The helicopter impacted a densely wooded area of the Ozark National Forest and came to rest between trees on its right side. The tailboom was fractured and bent to the right but remained attached via the tail rotor drive shaft. Damage to the helicopter was consistent with an impact with trees in a nose-low right bank. Several large branches at the site displayed cuts and a tree trunk exhibited 45° slash marks. About 5 gallons of fuel was drained from the fuel tank. Fuel collected at the firewall gascolator appeared clean and free of contaminants. The gascolator filter was clear of debris. &#x0D;\nAll main rotor blade and tail rotor linkages remained secured. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the cockpit controls to the swash plate to the blade pitch change links. Continuity of the main rotor drive system was confirmed by manually rotating the main rotor blades. The frame tubing displayed impact marks from the engine belt pulley with no directional score marks on either surface. All engine drive belts remained in place and were not damaged. The attitude indicator displayed a right bank, and the airspeed indicator displayed about 88 knots. Several of the cockpit lights were impact damaged, of the remaining lights, the oil pressure warning light’s filament was stretched. Examination of the airframe revealed no evidence of any preimpact anomalies. &#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact anomalies. The fuel servo was removed and bench tested. No malfunctions were detected with the fuel servo.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The noninstrument-rated pilot and passenger departed in the helicopter on a visual flight rules (VFR) cross-country flight. A family member reported that it was raining at the time of the helicopter’s departure, and about an hour later, she received a video from the passenger depicting the helicopter flying above a cloud layer with no discernable horizon and some of the clouds extending above the helicopter’s altitude. Review of weather and flight track information revealed that the helicopter climbed to an altitude of about 13,000 ft mean sea level (msl); remaining about that altitude for over 25 minutes. About 3 minutes before the accident, the helicopter entered a descent that continued to an altitude of about 9,200 ft msl, during which the helicopter completed more than two 360° descending turns of decreasing radius. The last recorded location of the helicopter was about 1,650 ft from the accident site. &#x0D;\nThe wreckage was highly fragmented, consistent with a high-speed impact. Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any preaccident mechanical failures or malfunctions. The helicopter was approved by the manufacturer for day and night VFR flight, and was not approved for instrument flight. The helicopter was not equipped with a supplemental oxygen system, nor was any supplemental oxygen equipment found in the wreckage.&#x0D;\nAIRMET Sierra for mountain obscuration and moderate icing between the freezing level 18,000 ft was valid for the accident site at the accident time. There was no record of the pilot receiving any preflight weather information from an access-controlled source. The helicopter was likely operating in visual meteorological conditions above the clouds until its initial descent from about 13,000 ft, at which point the helicopter likely entered and remained in instrument meteorological conditions for the rest of the flight. &#x0D;\nAlthough the altitude and duration of the flight did not meet regulatory requirements for supplemental oxygen use, it is likely that the pilot may have been experiencing some early effects of hypoxia, including euphoria, which may have exacerbated the effects from his use of multiple drugs. Toxicology testing revealed a blood level of amphetamine (around 300 ng/ml) and the presence of phenylpropanolamine, indicating that the pilot was most likely using a street preparation of the drug. Testing also identified phenylpropanolamine and oxycodone in blood and urine, and oxazepam in urine. Euphoria and over-confidence associated with the pilot’s amphetamine use would have likely been exacerbated by the early effects of hypoxia due to his decision to operate the helicopter at high altitude. &#x0D;\nThe pilot’s decision to operate the helicopter in reduced visibility conditions with no training in flight by reference to instruments in a helicopter that was not certified for instrument flight was conducive to the development of spatial disorientation. The helicopter’s turning descent before impact and the wreckage distribution that indicated a high-speed impact were both consistent with the known effects of spatial disorientation. Based on the available information, the pilot entered instrument meteorological conditions and shortly after, began experiencing spatial disorientation, which resulted in a loss of control and impact with terrain. It is likely that the psychoactive effects from the pilot’s use of amphetamine contributed to his preflight decision making, and the additional effects of early hypoxia contributed to his continued flight into adverse weather conditions. &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "The Pilot’s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, FAA-H-8083-25B, states in part: &#x0D;\nUnder normal flight conditions, when there is a visual reference to the horizon and ground, the sensory system in the inner ear helps to identify the pitch, roll, and yaw movements of the aircraft. When visual contact with the horizon is lost, the vestibular system becomes unreliable. Without visual references outside the aircraft, there are many situations in which normal motions and forces create convincing illusions that are difficult to overcome…Unless a pilot has many hours of training in instrument flight, flight should be avoided in reduced visibility or at night when the horizon is not visible. A pilot can reduce susceptibility to disorienting illusions through training and awareness and learning to rely totally on flight instruments.&#x0D;\nBe physically tuned for flight into reduced visibility. Ensure proper rest, adequate diet, and, if flying at night, allow for night adaptation. Remember that illness, medication, alcohol, fatigue, sleep loss, and mild hypoxia are likely to increase susceptibility to spatial disorientation.&#x0D;\nThe Pilot’s Operating Handbook for the R44 contains a Safety Notice (SN-18) which states in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlying a helicopter in obscured visibility due to fog, snow, low ceiling, or even dark night can be fatal. Helicopters have less inherent stability and much faster roll and pitch rates than airplanes. Loss of the pilot’s outside visual reference, even for a moment, can result in disorientation, wrong control inputs, and an uncontrolled crash. This type of situation is likely to occur when a pilot attempts to fly through a partially obscured area and realizes too late that he is losing visibility.&#x0D;\n - The Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter, serial number 10702, was manufactured in 2005, and was approved for VFR flights in day and night conditions. The helicopter was not equipped with a supplemental oxygen system, nor were any supplemental oxygen provisions found at the accident site.  A review of the maintenance records revealed that the last annual inspection was completed on January 13, 2019, and the associated entry stated, “Inspected avionics for security and basic electrical operation.” There were no instrument discrepancies recorded. &#x0D;\n - On May 17, 2019, about 1034 mountain daylight time, a Robinson R44 helicopter, N744TW, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Alpine, Utah. The pilot and passenger sustained fatal injuries. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s mother stated that the pilot kept the helicopter at his home in Myton, Utah, and that he and his wife had planned to fly to South Valley Regional Airport (U42), West Jordan, Utah, to pick up a second passenger before proceeding to Phoenix, Arizona. She saw the helicopter depart at 0930 and stated that it was raining lightly at that time. At 1022, she received a text message from the passenger stating that they were “17 minutes out.” At 1025, she received a text stating that “the flight was smooth.”  At 1027, she received a short video showing the helicopter above a thick cloud layer with no discernable horizon. Some of the cloud tops appeared above the helicopter, as seen in Figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Images recorded by a passenger.&#x0D;\nRadar data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed a target correlated to the accident helicopter first appear on radar at 0956 at an altitude of 10,400 ft mean sea level (msl), on a heading of 309° about 44 miles west of the pilot’s residence. The helicopter continued generally on a west-northwest course, as shown in Figure 2. The airspeed initially varied from 37 to 88 knots ground speed but stabilized to about 85 knots for most of the flight. The helicopter climbed to 13,000 ft msl at 1007 and remained between 12,700 and 13,000 ft ft msl until about 1030, when it descended below 12,500 ft msl. At 1031, the helicopter began a right descending right turn that continued until radar contact was lost at 1033 at an altitude of 9,200 ft msl and groundspeed of 108 knots, about 1,650 ft from the accident site. The data revealed that the helicopter completed about 2 1/2 360° turns before radar contact was lost. (see Figure 3.) &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Recorded radar targets showing the likely route of flight. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nFigure 3. Radar targets showing the turning descent. Path lines show estimated track.&#x0D;\n - Toxicology testing performed at two laboratories identified 300 ng/ml of amphetamine in blood obtained from the inferior vena cava; 346 ng/ml in heart blood and 4167 ng/ml in urine; phenylpropanolamine and oxycodone in heart blood and urine; oxymorphone, a metabolite of oxycodone in urine; and oxazepam in urine.&#x0D;\n - According to Leidos, the pilot did not have any contact with them or any other third-party vendors on the day or the day prior of the accident. &#x0D;\nRoosevelt Municipal Airport (74V), Roosevelt, Utah, located about 5 miles north of the pilot’s residence, about the time of departure reported wind from 080° at 3 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, broken clouds at 7,500 ft above ground level (agl), temperature 10°C, dew point temperature 3°C, altimeter setting of 29.77 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\nReported weather at U42 about the time of the accident included wind from 080° at 4 knots, visibility of 10 statute miles or greater, scattered clouds at 1,900 feet agl, ceiling broken at 4,300 feet agl, overcast at 5,000 feet agl, temperature 7°C, dew point temperature of 5°C, altimeter setting of 29.83 inches of mercury.  &#x0D;\nAIRMET Sierra was issued at 0845 for moderate icing between the freezing level and 18,000 ft msl and mountain obscuration by clouds, precipitation, or mist, and was active for the accident location at the accident time. Weather radar imagery above the accident location between about 8,600 ft and 14,200 ft msl identified reflectivity consistent with light rain in an area that included the accident site. (see Figure 4.)  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. Weather radar imagery&#x0D;\nSatellite imagery identified cloudy conditions over the accident site, with analysis indicating cloud tops of about 13,000 ft msl along the route of flight and a cloud top height of about 19,500 ft msl during the final portions of the flight, as shown in Figure 5.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5. Satellite imagery showing clouds.  &#x0D;\n - Review of the pilot's logbook revealed about 145.1 total hours of flight experience: about 30.5 hours in the Robinson R44 helicopter, and about 113.4 hours in the Robinson R22 helicopter. The logbook contained no entries for instrument flight training.&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s flight instructor stated that he had last provided instruction to the pilot about one year before the accident. The instructor followed a private pilot training syllabus that did not include instrument training. The instructor stated that they had done some instrument flight rules (IFR) training, and less than 5 hours “hood work” (with a view limiting device) because the pilot wanted to try it. He stated that they had discussed visual flight rules (VFR) cloud clearance requirements. The instructor stated that they may have done some unusual attitude recoveries. &#x0D;\n - The debris field was about 7,656 ft msl elevation, oriented on a magnetic heading of 127° and was about 125 ft in length. The first piece of wreckage in the debris path was a small portion of a tail rotor blade. The empennage separated from the tail cone, and the tail cone separated from the fuselage. The fuselage came to rest on its right side, with the cabin portion of the fuselage fractured and lying on its left side. Both landing skids separated from the fuselage. The main rotor blades remained attached to the hub and were bowed down. The main rotor hub remained attached to the driveshaft, and the pylon remained attached to the transmission.&#x0D;\nFuel remaining at the time of the accident was estimated to be about 13 gallons, based on a fuel consumption estimate of 15 gallons per hour, the last recorded fuel purchase of 39 gallons and a subsequent flight time of 2.25 hours.&#x0D;\nExamination of the recovered airframe, flight control system components, and engine revealed no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The non-instrument-rated pilot and passenger intended to fly the helicopter, which was not equipped for instrument flight, in order to photograph the passenger's family member fishing, despite a forecast of instrument meteorological conditions. The helicopter flew for about 11 minutes, making several left and right turns in the vicinity of where the family member was fishing at an altitude of about 175 ft. The passenger was texting the family member, and at one point asked \"Can you see us? We are hitting the wall that we can't fly through.\" The family member responded, \"not really,\" and the passenger sent one last text message stating, \"Give me one more [GPS] pin to try.\" After the last message, the helicopter began to fly south over water and away from land and any natural horizon.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was located in the water about 1.5 miles from the shoreline. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical anomaly. Analyses of weather information, witness statements, and photographs taken by the passenger were consistent with conditions of limited visibility and a lack of a visible horizon. In these limited visibility conditions, especially when flying away from shore, the pilot's workload would have increased as he divided his attention between maintaining control of the helicopter and an adequate altitude above the water using poor visual cues and positioning of the helicopter laterally while looking for the fishing vessel. These conditions were conducive to the both the development of spatial disorientation and loss of control, or an inadvertent descent into the water (due to distraction or a visual illusion). The ability of the pilot to detect any loss of control or a trajectory towards the water was significantly reduced as a result of the extremely low altitude in which the flight over water was conducted, the low visibility, the lack of instruments on board to allow for instrument flight, and his lack of instrument training and experience.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Flight School Aircraft Use Agreement&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator's aircraft use agreement, pilots renting the helicopter were required to fly in VFR weather with a 3,000-ft ceiling and 6 miles visibility when flying without a flight instructor. - There was a placard on the instrument panel of the helicopter that stated, \"This rotorcraft is approved for night and day VFR operation.\" Additionally, according to general limitations in the helicopter's flight manual, the helicopter was limited to day and night VFR operations only. - On May 4, 2019, about 1211 eastern daylight time, a Guimbal Cabri G2 helicopter, N572MD, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Kent Island, Maryland. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a family member of the passenger, the flight was planned so that the passenger could take photographs of that family member's fishing trip in the Chesapeake Bay. The passenger texted the family member at 0829 stating \"looks like we are going to be flying. Where are you guys fishing? Not sure how well my cell works when up.\" The family member responded with the location at 0841. Then, at 1036 the passenger stated \"OK, no problem. The closer you stayed at Poplar Island the better chance we might have [of] finding you with this low ceiling there's flight restrictions.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot called flight services at 1102 to file a special flight rules area (SFRA) flight plan for a local flight originating from Tipton Airport (FME), Fort Meade, Maryland. During the phone call, the flight briefer noted that instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed for the intended flight and that he could not recommend a visual flight rules flight. Furthermore, he stated that AIRMET Sierra was issued for instrument flight rule (IFR) conditions and was currently active and ending between 1700 and 2000. The briefer asked the pilot if he needed a standard weather briefing and the pilot responded that he did not need any other information.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1145, the passenger texted the family member that the helicopter was en route. At 1151, the family member sent the passenger the GPS location and the passenger responded at 1202, \"Rats. You guys are too far west… flight rules.\" At 1203 the family member sent another GPS location to the passenger and the passenger responded at 1208, \"Can you see us? We are hitting the wall that we can't fly through.\" The family member responded, \"not really\" and the passenger sent one last text message at 1208 stating, \"Give me one more pin to try.\" There were no further communications with the passenger.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration radar data, the helicopter flew over Kent Island and made several left and right turns over the southern tip of the island then flew about 2 miles south of the island. The helicopter maneuvered in that area beginning at 1200 until radar contact was lost at 1211. The radar track indicated that the helicopter was flying about 175 ft above the water for the final 10 minutes of the flight. Figure 1 depicts the helicopter's radar radar-observed flight path for the accident flight in red. The yellow arrows trace the helicopter's flight path as it initially transitioned from flying over land to water. The white arrows trace the helicopter's flight path as it continued to maneuver over the water, and the pink arrows trace the final portion of the flight until radar contact was lost. The number 1 point depicts where the wreckage of the helicopter was located in the water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 - The red line depicts the helicopter's radar-observed flight path for the 10 minutes before the accident. Note: The time displayed at the beginning of the radar plot is in universal coordinated time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses reported seeing the helicopter flying around the southern point of Kent Island for several minutes before the accident occurred. One witness stated that the weather was \"cloudy and the fog was heavy.\" Another witness reported that the helicopter was \"flying very low to the water in dense fog.\" - The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Baltimore, Maryland, performed the autopsy on the pilot. The autopsy report indicated the cause of death was multiple injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing of the pilot was performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory. Fluid and tissue specimens tested negative for ethanol and other drugs. - The National Weather Service issued an update at 1045 for AIRMET Sierra, which indicated IFR conditions for the area surrounding the accident location and advised of ceilings below 1,000 ft, visibility below 3 statute miles, precipitation, mist, and fog.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne photograph taken by the passenger while on the accident flight showed the visibility over the water was less than 3 miles. In another photograph, it was difficult to differentiate between the water and the sky.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 - Photograph that passenger took on accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt could not be determined if the pilot reviewed any other weather information beyond that provided when he filed his flight plan before the flight. - The pilot did not hold an instrument rating, nor did he record any instrument flight time or simulated instrument flight time in his logbook. - The helicopter impacted the Chesapeake Bay about 1.5 miles from the shoreline of Kent Island and was recovered from a depth of about 63 ft. All major components of the helicopter were recovered, and an oil and fuel sheen was noted on the water by first responders. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the flight controls to the main rotor and tail rotor through multiple overstress fractures. Continuity was confirmed from the throttle to the engine through all push-pull tubes. The windscreen, doors, and forward section of the fuselage were fragmented. The instrument console remained attached to the main wreckage through cables and wires. Both seats were impact-separated in the forward direction but remained attached to the fuselage by their seatbelts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll main rotor blades remained attached to the rotor head but were removed to facilitate recovery. The yellow rotor blade exhibited impact damage and was fragmented. The lead/lag damper was not extended. The green rotor blade was impact damaged and the outboard portion of the blade was partially separated. The lead/lag damper was extended about 0.5 cm. The red rotor blade was impact damaged and sections of the trailing edge were splayed open. The red lead/lag damper was extended about 4 cm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fenestron remained attached to the tailboom. Chordwise scratching was noted on the fenestron housing. All fenestron vanes were bent the opposite direction of travel. The tail rotor rotated freely when the tail rotor drive shaft was rotated by hand. The tail rotor drive shaft was bent and separated from the transmission. Continuity was confirmed from the anti-torque pedals to the tail rotor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the helicopter through two of the three engine mounts and was removed from the airframe for further examination. Crankshaft continuity was confirmed by rotating the scroll assembly by hand. The scroll assembly exhibited impact damage along about one-third of the circumference. Thumb compression and suction were noted on the Nos. 2, 3, and 4 cylinders. The No. 1 cylinder was removed since it exhibited weak compression and was examined. When water was placed in the cylinder, most of the water leaked through the exhaust valve seat and a minor amount of water leaked through the intake valve seat.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor was removed from the engine. Fuel and water were noted in the bowl. The carburetor floats exhibited hydraulic deformation. The accelerator pump operated when the throttle arm was moved by hand. The carburetor fuel inlet screen was removed, and no debris was noted. The carburetor gasket was removed, and no tears were noted. The carburetor heat door was in the closed position. The assembly was impact damaged and pushed up onto the carburetor. The automatic carburetor door was tested using a 12V battery. When the wires were connected to the battery, the door operated and moved to an open position. The wires were then moved to the opposite poles of the battery and the carburetor door moved to the closed position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe oil suction screen was removed, and no debris was noted. The oil filter was removed, disassembled, and no debris was noted in the filter. The engine driven fuel pump was removed from the engine and it operated when moved by hand. The helicopter was equipped with an electronic and single-conventional magneto ignition system. The conventional magneto was removed from the engine and produced spark on all towers when rotated. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and two passengers departed on a helicopter tour flight around the island. Air traffic control radar and communications information indicated that the flight encountered deteriorating visibility conditions enroute. About this time, the helicopter slowed from about 108 knots (kts) to about 92 kts and initiated a turn. Shortly thereafter, radar data then indicated a rapid descent from an altitude about 1,700 ft above ground level. Witnesses near the accident site reported hearing the helicopter in the clouds and reported that it sounded as if it was very low. They then described the sound of metal hitting metal and saw pieces of the helicopter falling from the sky.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the airframe revealed that the forward left roof and floor/chin exhibited damage consistent with contact from a main rotor blade. One main rotor blade exhibited a spanwise dent which displayed equally spaced score marks consistent with the row of screws in the windshield bow. The outboard portion of one of the main rotor blades, along with left fuselage and left side cabin components, were found early in the debris path. The main rotor drive shaft was bent about 20° above the swashplate. Arc-shaped scoring was observed on both sides of the main rotor hub adjacent to the pitch horns. Both teeter stops were crushed, and the driveshaft was dented. The droop stop bolt at the nut was sheard but remained in place. Examination of the engine revealed no anomalies and the evidence indicated that the engine was operating at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter was equipped with a two-bladed, semirigid rotor system. This design is susceptible to excessive rotor blade flapping, during periods of low-G’s or the pilot’s improper application of control inputs.  Excessive rotor blade flapping can result in main rotor contact with the fuselage. A manufacturer safety notice stated, in part, that, when flying in turbulence, the helicopter should be slowed below a normal cruise speed to around 60 to 70 kts.  &#x0D;\nReview of weather information for the area of the accident site around the time of the accident revealed a warm, moist environment that supported heavy rain showers that could produce unexpected strong downdrafts, reduced visibilities, wet microburst, and outflow wind conditions. At the time of the accident, weather surveillance radar reflectivity values indicated a descending core of 20 to 30 dBZ values descending towards the surface from above the accident site. The accident flight likely encountered this downdraft or outflow boundary, reduced visibilities, and rapidly changing and unexpected wind conditions. Which likely caused a low-G condition, excessive main rotor flapping, and an in-flight breakup when the main rotor contacted the cabin area.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "The accident helicopter was equipped with a semirigid rotor system. The FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook states, in part: this system usually has two blades that are rigidly mounted to the main rotor hub. The main rotor hub is free to tilt with respect to the main rotor shaft on what is known as a teetering or flapping hinge. If [rotor] flapping exceeds the design value, the static stop will contact the mast...This contact must be avoided at all costs. &#x0D;\nHelicopters rely on positive G to provide much or all of their response to pilot control inputs. Low-G conditions can be catastrophic for two-bladed helicopters. Turbulence and severe downdrafts can also cause a low-G condition, and when combined with high airspeed, may lead to the static stop impacting the mast. The accident sequence may be extremely rapid, and the energy and inertia in the rotor system can sever the mast or allow rotor blades to strike the tail or other portions of the helicopter.”&#x0D;\nRobinson Safety Notice SN-32, \"High Winds or Turbulence,\" states that a pilot's improper application of control inputs in response to turbulence can increase the likelihood of a mast bumping accident. It recommends that pilots reduce airspeed below normal cruise speed to 60-70 knots in significant turbulence, and states that pilots should allow for momentary airspeed, heading, altitude, and rpm excursions during flight in turbulent conditions and use gentle control inputs to restore the helicopter to level flight in order to avoid overcontrolling. &#x0D;\n - On April 29, 2019, about 0910 Hawaii-Aleutian standard time, a Robinson R-44 helicopter, N808NV, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Kailua, Hawaii. The commercial pilot and two passengers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 air tour flight. &#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter and another of the operator's helicopters departed from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Honolulu, Hawaii, about 0854 for an island tour. Radar, ADS-B, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control (ATC) data indicated that the helicopters flew east along the south shore of the island. They then turned to the northwest; at 0907:58, the pilot of the accident helicopter reported that he was over Bellows Air Force Base requesting a northwest transition. The controller approved the transition, and about 13 seconds later, the second helicopter pilot made the same request. About 1 minute later, the controller asked the two helicopters, \"How is the weather looking over Kailua right now?\" The second helicopter pilot reported that the weather was \"still VFR, but it's getting a little bit harder to see\"; that helicopter subsequently turned toward the water. About 10 seconds later, the pilot of the accident helicopter, who was further inland and approaching Kailua, contacted the controller and stated that he wanted to alter his course in the same manner. The controller approved and informed both pilots to maintain flight at or above 600 ft. The accident helicopter started a right turn toward the water at a ground speed of about 108 knots and acknowledged the altitude assignment. There were no further transmissions from the accident helicopter.  &#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter continued toward the water for about 1/2 nautical mile (nm) before it made a left turn further inland over Kailua and its ground speed decreased from about 108 knots to 104 knots. Shortly thereafter, the helicopter's ground speed started to decrease to about 100 knots, and it made a gradual right turn parallel to a roadway; its ground speed continued to decrease to about 92 knots. About 0.19 mile from the accident site, the helicopter was at 1,700 ft above ground level (agl) when it entered an abrupt descent and track information ended about 0.11 mile from the accident site. The last data point indicated that the helicopter was about 1,425 ft agl with a vertical descent rate of 7,360 ft per minute. At the time of the accident, the second helicopter was about 2.5 miles to the southeast over the water. That pilot did not witness the accident and the helicopter continued its flight uneventfully to HNL. &#x0D;\nA witness reported that she was standing outside when she heard the accident helicopter flying overhead; it sounded very low and loud. She looked up but did not see the helicopter due to heavy cloud cover, and she assumed that the helicopter was either inside of or on top of the clouds. About 10 seconds later, she heard what sounded like metal hitting metal, followed by the sound of ripping metal. One second later, she saw a piece of the main rotor blade below the clouds. The piece spiraled down on an angle, in kind of an \"elliptical pattern.\" She never saw the helicopter. &#x0D;\nOther witnesses reported that they heard the helicopter overhead but did not look up until they heard an odd noise followed by a loud metallic bang. One witness reported that when he looked up, the helicopter pitched forward, tilted to one side, and entered a nosedive. He also observed a piece of the rotor blade detach and fall away from the helicopter. He noted that nothing was moving, and there were no helicopter noises; it seemed like the helicopter stopped in midair and started to freefall. The helicopter impacted the street and a post-crash fire ensued. &#x0D;\nA security camera near the accident site showed overcast skies. The helicopter could be heard approaching followed by a loud crashing sound. Shortly thereafter, the helicopter could be seen falling through the frame. The helicopter appeared to be in a freefall on its side; one main rotor blade was completely stopped, and the second blade was not visible. The tail boom was bent at about a 90° angle and extended upward. &#x0D;\n - An autopsy of the pilot was performed by the Department of the Medical Examiner, City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii. The cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries. &#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and tested-for drugs. &#x0D;\n - The Pacific Surface Analysis for 0800 indicated a surface trough located over the northwestern Hawaiian Islands in the vicinity of the accident site. Troughs can act as lifting mechanisms to help produce clouds and precipitation if sufficient moisture is present. With the trade winds and mountainous terrain, there was sufficient moisture and lift for rain shower and thunderstorm formation. The station model near the accident site depicted an east wind of 20 knots. &#x0D;\nAt 0800, a Global Data Assimilation System sounding for the accident site indicated a conditionally unstable environment from the surface through 12,500 ft mean sea level (msl). If rain showers or thunderstorms formed in this environment, the sounding indicated that the strongest wind speed possible at the surface from any downdraft or outflow wind was 37 knots. The sounding also indicated a favorable environment for a downdraft, outflow boundary, or gust front from rain showers or thunderstorms which can create an environment favorable for unexpected changes in wind direction and speed. There were no indications of additional low-level wind shear or clear-air turbulence from the surface through 14,000 ft msl. &#x0D;\nSatellite imagery depicted a band of cumuliform clouds located above the accident site at the accident time. The cloud cover and cumuliform bands were moving from east to west in the low-level wind flow. In addition, weather surveillance radar indicated light to moderate intensity echoes above the accident site at the time of the accident and along the helicopter's flightpath. The rain shower activity was expanding in area coverage with time.  The weather surveillance radar reflectivity values indicated a descending core of 20 to 30 dBZ values descending towards the surface between 0907 and 0915 from above the accident site. &#x0D;\n - The operator reported that the pilot was hired by the company about 2 1/2 weeks before the accident. The pilot completed company training for Part 135 operations on April 19, 2019, then completed one week of tour-specific training. He began taking passengers on tours about 3 days before the accident. The accident flight was the pilot's first flight on the day of the accident. &#x0D;\n - The wreckage came to rest in a residential area. The debris field was about 1/4-mile long and extended along a heading of about 009° magnetic. The first identified pieces of debris were a piece of plexiglass and carpet. Directly northeast of the first identified pieces of debris, and slightly out of the main debris path, was the outboard third of one main rotor blade, which came to rest in a fence. Following the first identified pieces of debris along the debris path was a large area of scattered left side airframe and cockpit components followed by other items from the cabin area and the main fuel tank, which was separated from the airframe and located about 70 yards south of the main wreckage. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on its left side on a roadway and a large portion of the forward left side fuselage was not present at the main wreckage. The remaining portions of the left side of the helicopter exhibited damage consistent with contact from the main rotor blade. The left cabin seats exhibited damage outboard to inboard. The left corner of the instrument console was bent inward toward the passenger compartment. The aft cabin, main rotor driveshaft and assembly, and engine exhibited postimpact fire damage. The main rotor blades remained attached to the main rotor hub and exhibited extensive damage. The blue main rotor blade was bent 90° about midspan.  &#x0D;\nThe tail boom remained attached to the fuselage; the forward portion of the tail boom exhibited areas of crush damage. The horizontal and vertical stabilizers were mostly intact and exhibited some crush damage. The tail skid tube was not damaged. The tail rotor assembly remained attached to the airframe and was relatively undamaged; the tail rotor blades exhibited limited, non-rotational, impact-related damage.&#x0D;\nDuring a postaccident examination of the airframe, the tail rotor and main rotor flight controls were visually traced and mostly present. All of the fractured surfaces were consistent with overload. The main rotor driveshaft was seized and would not rotate by hand; it was bent about a 20° angle above the swashplate. Arc-shaped scoring was observed on both sides of the main rotor hub adjacent to the pitch horns. Both teeter stops were crushed, and the driveshaft was dented. The droop stop bolt at the nut end was sheared but remained in place. The main rotor blades were removed from the hub and examined. The afterbody of the blue blade exhibited damage consistent with the shape of the left skid toe. The red main rotor blade was bent near the hub, and about one-third of the outboard tip was fracture-separated and found earlier in the wreckage debris path. Slightly inboard from about halfway, on the lower side of the red blade, was a spanwise dent that extended about 45 inches. Within the dent were equally spaced score marks consistent with the row of screws in the windshield bow. &#x0D;\nThe upper sheave of the drivetrain exhibited rotational scoring on the forward face along with scoring on nearby support tubes. Three of the V-belts were fracture-separated consistent with overload; one remained intact but was no longer seated in its groove. The tail rotor driveshaft exhibited three breaks throughout. A small section was separated and not present; there was no apparent twisting at the fracture points.  &#x0D;\nThe vertical firewall exhibited severe impact damage to its left and lower sides. The cooling fan exhibited rotational scoring on its aft face, and the lower half of the cooling fan was flat at the 6 o'clock position. The oil cooler exhibited an approximate 1-inch-deep indentation from the starter ring gear; the indentation exhibited both grinding and teeth impression marks.&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the engine did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and flight engineer were conducting a flight test to evaluate developmental main rotor blades that had been installed on the helicopter. The flight consisted of multiple autorotations at maximum gross weight, entered following a 1-second delay after a simulated loss of engine power. A witness saw the helicopter falling from the sky and saw several other objects descending to the ground before losing sight of it behind trees. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage revealed damage to the main rotor mast, consistent with a mast bumping event. Cyclic controls were installed in both the pilot’s seat and the left seat, where the flight test engineer sat with equipment used for recording flight parameters, including an 8-lb laptop computer. In order for the engineer to operate the computer or take notes on the clipboard, he would have to hold the computer with one hand while using the other to enter commands or take notes. The installation of the cyclic in the engineer’s position represented a deviation from company procedures by both the pilot and the flight test engineer. Examination revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter prior to the mast bumping. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight engineer’s fatigue of holding the 8-lb computer over his lap, the awkwardness of entering commands with one hand, or taking notes single-handedly may have allowed the computer to suddenly shift and strike or block the cyclic during the simulated loss of power test at the critical low-G flight condition.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "The operator stated that the flight test engineer’s cockpit position cyclic control stick was typically removed during test flights. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe two rotor blades installed on the helicopter were developmental prototype blades that were being used to collect data for certification requirements. The main rotor blade was an aftermarket replacement main rotor blade for the Bell model 206B helicopter. The blade was constructed using carbon fiber/epoxy pre-preg woven fabric and unidirectional tape. The blade interfaced with the existing Bell main rotor hub using two titanium grip plates. The grip plates were bolted to the composite sub-assembly. The blade incorporated a NASA-developed laminar flow airfoil. The tip was tapered in both chord and thickness directions. No modifications were required to the helicopter to install the blades. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne of the blades was instrumented using strain gages to measure blade loads during the test flight. The measured loads were flap bending, chord bending, and torsion at several locations along the span of the blade. The information obtained during the test flight was stored on the test equipment in the helicopter’s passenger compartment and the engineer’s laptop.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight test engineer’s laptop computer remained largely intact, and files of the accident flight were obtained from the hard drive. Data from near the time of the accident were not recovered. The data from the obtained files showed multiple maneuvers performed during the flight, during which the blade displayed consistent load behavior. The maneuvers from the flight cards that were not identified in the data were a simulated power failure involving a one-second delay before the pilot reacts to the maneuver, and two autorotations with lateral reversals. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe simulated power failure maneuver procedure required the pilot to initiate the maneuver from level flight at 100 kts. The pilot then reduced the engine power to flight idle by using the collective twist grip, allowing a one-second delay. The pilot then lowered the collective, applied right pedal to maintain directional control, and entered an autorotative descent. The purpose of this maneuver is to represent a realistic reaction of a pilot when confronted with a sudden loss of engine power. It is possible to impart a low-G condition on the helicopter during the execution of this maneuver if the collective is lowered rapidly. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21B), in part, stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLow-G Conditions and Mast Bumping&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHelicopters rely on positive G to provide much or all of their response to pilot control inputs. The pilot uses the cyclic to tilt the rotor disk, and at one G, the rotor is producing thrust equal to aircraft weight. The tilting of the thrust vector provides a moment about the center of gravity to pitch or roll the fuselage. In a low-G condition, the thrust and consequently the control authority are greatly reduced…helicopters with two-bladed teetering rotors rely entirely on the tilt of the thrust vector for control. Therefore, low-G conditions can be catastrophic for two-bladed helicopters. &#x0D;\n - On April 16, 2019, about 0706 mountain standard time, an experimental Bell 206B helicopter, N61PH, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Fort McDowell, Arizona. The commercial pilot and flight test engineer were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 test flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that the purpose of the flight was to evaluate the developmental main rotor blades that had been installed on the helicopter. The helicopter was fueled for two test flight legs. The helicopter departed at 0545 for the first leg and returned about 0620, parked on the ramp with the engine at idle, and 100 lbs of ballast was added to the helicopter. Radar data showed that the helicopter departed at 0632 to continue the second leg of the test flight. The test flight consisted of multiple autorotations at maximum gross weight following a simulated loss of engine power. The operator reported that the commercial pilot who was in control of the helicopter would perform all the flight maneuvers and the flight test engineer would perform several tasks during the test flight, which included holding a 17-inch, 7.72-lb engineering laptop with his left hand above the cyclic control while simultaneously using and stowing a clipboard and pencil to manage data collection. A corded event marker that was connected to equipment in the aft cabin area was also used to identify the beginning and end of a flight test maneuver and would normally be draped over the laptop when not in use. The clipboard was normally stowed between the center console and the flight engineer’s seat. Flight cards are prepared for each test flight and listed the maneuvers to be performed during the flight. The accident flight was to be the last test flight of the main rotor blades before their certification process. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the radar data revealed that the accident flight duration was about 34 minutes. The pilot executed multiple turns and descent maneuvers near the area of the accident site. The airplane’s final radar-recorded altitude was 4,400 ft mean sea level (msl), or about 3,000 ft above ground level (agl). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness who was walking to a bus stop about 1/3-mile northwest of the accident site heard a loud bang southeast of her position. She saw the helicopter falling from the sky and used her phone to video record the helicopter and several other objects descending to the ground before losing sight of it behind trees along the road. &#x0D;\n - The examination of the accident site revealed postcrash fire and impact damage consistent with a right side-down, nose-level attitude during ground impact. The main rotor hub assembly, vertical fin stabilizer, tail rotor assembly, tail rotor driveshaft, and forward induction cowl fairing separated from the main wreckage and was found in the debris field. One main rotor blade was found furthest from the main wreckage. The other main rotor blade was found near the main wreckage. The debris field was about 1 mile long and 1,000 ft wide, covering an area of wooded desert terrain and flood-irrigated alfalfa fields. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage revealed thermal and impact damage. Both the left and right seat cyclic controls were installed. Both the main rotor blades separated approximately 4 ft outboard of the blade grips. Both blades exhibited witness marks consistent with the tail boom or tail rotor contact. The main rotor mast revealed damage consistent with a mast bumping event. The examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of preaccident mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA tail rotor blade, main rotor blades, and main rotor hub were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for further examination. The components exhibited features consistent with overstress fractures. There were no indications of pre-existing damage or failures.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "About 5 days before the accident, the helicopter's engine lost power and the owner performed an off-airport landing to a field. The helicopter was not damaged during the landing, and several days later, maintenance personnel examined the helicopter while still in the field. The mechanics examined the helicopter's fuel system, replaced a fuel servo, and after a successful test run of the engine, the commercial pilot departed with one of the mechanics on board for the accident flight in order to reposition the helicopter from the field to a maintenance facility. About 15 minutes into the flight, the engine lost power, and the pilot performed an autorotation to a roadway. After touchdown, the helicopter slid on the roadway, the main rotor contacted a telephone pole, and a 2.5-ft piece of a main rotor blade separated and impacted a truck driving on the roadway, fatally injuring the passenger and seriously injuring the driver of the truck.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter's engine revealed that the air induction inlet duct was partially collapsed. The inner rubberized fabric liner of the duct had partially delaminated and separated from the outer rubberized fabric, obstructing the interior volume of the duct. The wire stiffener between the two layers of fabric was displaced in two locations near the center of the duct length at a 90° bend.  Further examination of the duct found a liquid residue in some areas of the duct that was consistent with castor oil, which was normally used in the assembly and curing of the duct during its manufacture. Given this information, it is likely that during the duct's manufacture, castor oil was inadvertently introduced between the duct's two fabric layers, interfering with the bond between the them. It is also likely that the duct then partially collapsed, which restricted airflow to the helicopter's engine and resulted in the losses of engine power that occurred both before and during the accident flight.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Construction of the Duct&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter engine's induction air inlet duct consisted of a tube section with an inner layer made from fiberglass cloth that was impregnated with a silicone rubber. A corrosion-resistant steel wire was wound in a helix over the top of the inner layer and an outer layer of rubberized silicone cloth was wrapped over the top of the wire, thereby embedding the wire in between two layers of rubberized cloth. Two fiberglass cords were then wrapped around the outside of the tube, one cord on either side of the helical steel wire. Each end of the duct was terminated by a rubberized fiberglass cloth cuff. The duct was manufactured by using partially-cured sheets of rubberized cloth and assembling the tube components on a mandrel. The assembled tube was then cured in an oven, thereby co-curing the inner and outer layers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPost-Accident Safety Actions&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs a result of this accident, Robinson Helicopter issued Service Bulletin (SB)-97, dated April 11, 2019, pertaining to the inspection of air induction hoses with part No. A785-31 on specific R44 II helicopters. The SB advised R44 II helicopter owners, operators, and maintenance personnel to, within 1 flight hour, \"visually inspect inside of hose to verify no separation between outer and inner layers.\" The SB also advised \"flex the hose and listen for a crinkling sound, which is an indication of separation\" and \"prior to further flight, replace any hose with an indication of separation.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRobinson Helicopter also issued SB-100, dated July 3, 2019, expanding the inspections to other R44 II helicopters and spare A785-31 air induction hoses that shipped through March 2019.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA issued Airworthiness Directive 2019-12-18, effective July 5, 2019, requiring inspection of the air induction hose, within 10 hours time in service, on specific R44 II helicopters, including those with an A785-31 hose installed after April 30, 2018. The airworthiness directive indicated that, \"if there is any separation or crinkling sound, replace the hose before further flight\"; otherwise, the hose could be replaced within 50 hours time in service. - The four-seat helicopter was manufactured in 2019. It was powered by a Lycoming IO-540-AE1A5, 260-horsepower engine. At the time of the accident, the airframe and engine total time was 81.34 hours. - On April 4, 2019, about 1416 eastern daylight time, a Robinson R44 II helicopter, N4046J, was substantially damaged during a forced landing to a roadway near Tampa, Florida. The pilot and the passenger were not injured, but a passenger in a nearby vehicle was fatally injured, and the driver of the vehicle sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the positioning flight, which was destined for Sarasota/Bradenton International Airport (SRQ), Sarasota, Florida. The positioning flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner of the helicopter reported that, 5 days before the accident, he had flown the helicopter for about 1 hour at an altitude of 1,000 ft mean sea level when the engine lost total power. He located a field for landing and performed an autorotation to the ground. The helicopter was not damaged during the landing. The owner further stated that he restarted the engine and that it ran at idle for several minutes before he pulled on the collective and the engine lost power again. The owner restarted the engine and kept the main rotor disengaged while he ran the engine up to 100% power without a load; the owner reported that the engine ran well but that, when he engaged the main rotor and started to pull on the collective, the engine lost power another time. The owner shut down the engine and contacted the helicopter manufacturer about repairing the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector contacted the pilot on the morning of the accident and told him that work on the helicopter was being performed by two mechanics from Florida Suncoast Helicopters. According to the FAA inspector, he observed the Florida Suncoast Helicopters mechanics as they performed maintenance on the helicopter in the field where the helicopter had previously landed. The mechanics told the inspector that they had cleaned the fuel screen and looked for contamination. A pilot employed by Florida Suncoast Helicopters then started the engine and let it warm up. The pilot subsequently pulled on the collective, and the engine lost total power. After discussion with the helicopter manufacturer, the mechanics replaced the fuel servo unit with a new one. The FAA inspector then departed and asked the mechanics to call after the repairs were complete, and to tell him what was repaired.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the mechanics and the pilot employed by Florida Suncoast Helicopters, after the fuel servo unit was changed, the pilot performed a test run of the engine and hovered the helicopter for several minutes. No problems were noted. The pilot and one of the mechanics boarded the helicopter and departed the field about 1401 with the intent of repositioning the helicopter to SRQ, where the company's maintenance facility was located. About 15 minutes later, the engine lost total power, and the pilot performed an autorotation to a roadway.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter touchdown on the roadway, the helicopter slid on the pavement due to its forward momentum. The helicopter then slid sideways, and the main rotor blades contacted a telephone pole, and a 2.5-ft-long piece of a main rotor blade separated and impact the windshield of a truck driving on the roadway. - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a rating for rotorcraft-helicopter. He held an FAA-issued second-class medical certificate, dated March 20, 2019. According to the pilot's logbook, he had a total of 657.9 hours of flight experience. - The helicopter came to rest along a heading of 180 next to a telephone pole that had been cut in half. Both main rotor blades were fractured at the tips and had cable cuts along the blades. The skids on the helicopter were damaged, consistent with a hard landing, and the skids' rear cross- tube was fractured. The tailcone was buckled on the top located at the second bay. One pitch link for the rotor blade had fractured and separated. The vertical firewall was wrinkled at the lower right corner.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that the induction air inlet duct was partially collapsed. The inner rubberized fabric liner of the duct had partially delaminated and separated from the outer rubberized fabric, obstructing the interior volume of the duct. The wire stiffener between the two layers of fabric was displaced in two locations near the center of the duct length, at the 90° bend. No other discrepancies of the airframe or engine were noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe induction air inlet duct was provided to the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials Laboratory for further investigation. The duct was dissected to examine the internal surfaces. A liquid residue was observed in some areas of the duct. The residue was analyzed, and the best matches were several oxidized vegetable oils, including castor oil, which was used by the duct manufacturer, along with a water-based release agent, in the assembly and curing of the air inlet duct. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "While conducting controlled fire operations, the helicopter was maneuvering over trees, when the engine lost power. The pilot performed an autorotation and the helicopter impacted trees and then terrain, and came to rest on its side. The fuselage and empennage sustained substantial damage. One crewmember was fatally injured. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination revealed that a fuel line between the engine firewall and hydro-mechanical unit (HMU) was loose and not secured with safety wire as required. About 25 flight hours before the accident, that fuel line was disconnected to defuel of the helicopter in order to perform a weight and balance check. No other maintenance was performed in that area. The mechanic who returned the helicopter to service stated that he was confident that he torqued and secured the line. No other anomalies were detected with the helicopter which would have precluded normal flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe circumstances of the accident are consistent with a loss of engine power due to the loose fuel line.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Review of Mountain Air Fleet&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the accident, Mountain Air inspected their other helicopters, and all helicopters had the fuel lines properly secured. &#x0D;\n - On March 27, 2019, about 1410 central daylight time, an Airbus AS350B3 helicopter, N818MC, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Montgomery, Texas. The pilot was seriously injured, one crew member was fatally injured, and another crew member sustained minor injuries. The helicopter was operated as a public flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter and United States Forest Service (USFS) crew were conducting plastic sphere dispenser (PSD) applications in support of a controlled fire operation in an area of the Sam Houston National Forest.  The pilot and surviving crew member reported that, after completing the application, they began flying back to the staging area when the engine lost total power. The helicopter descended into trees and subsequently impacted terrain, coming to rest on its right side. The surviving crew member and pilot were able to exit the helicopter; however, the second crew member was partially ejected from the helicopter and sustained fatal injuries.&#x0D;\n - The helicopter came to rest in a wooded area of the Sam Houston National Forest, at an elevation of 328 ft mean sea level on a 108° magnetic heading. All major components of the helicopter were located at the accident scene. Trees surrounding the accident site were about 70 ft tall and displayed damage consistent with a helicopter descent vector of about 40-50°. There was no post impact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel line between the firewall and hydro-mechanical unit (HMU) was loose and the required safety wire was not installed. All other connections were found to be secure. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any additional discrepancies. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration inspectors from the Houston Flight Standards District Office interviewed Mountain Air’s Director of Maintenance, who stated that on February 14, 2019, the USFS requested to validate the helicopter’s weight and balance. The helicopter was defueled, which involved disconnecting the main fuel line. After the weight and balance were verified, the main fuel line was reconnected. The director of maintenance asked another mechanic to verify that the fuel lines were reconnected, which was reportedly accomplished. The mechanic that accomplished the work informed the operator that he “was confident” that he torqued and secured the line. There was no other maintenance work which involved opening the fuel line after that day. On February 23, 2019, the helicopter’s engine would not light, and the engine’s igniters and/or igniter box was replaced. A maintenance records review found that the helicopter flew about 24.9 hours after the weight and balance was conducted on February 14, 2019. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 25, 2019, the pilot reported to management that the fuel pressure light had “flickered” during a flight “a few days before;” the pilot turned on the fuel boost pump, turned it off, and the light never reappeared. The pilot was informed to monitor the situation and report if it occurred again.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the accident, the digital engine control unit (DECU) was removed and sent to the manufacturer for data download. On April 11, 2019, the DECU was downloaded under the auspices of the FAA. The last recorded fault was a “P3 drift or engine flame out.”&#x0D;\n -",

The characteristics of the turn as it tightened over the last 25 seconds of the flight (increasing roll, decreasing pitch, and vertical descent rate) are consistent with the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation and loss of control. The restricted visual references resulting from the low cloud ceilings and flight over a body of water that lacked significant contrasting terrain features would have been conducive to the development of spatial disorientation; and the low altitude in which he was flying would have limited his available time to recover. &#x0D;\nPostaccident examination revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "A company pilot stated that he flew an operational check flight in the accident helicopter on March 9, 2019, sometime after the sun went down around 1900, and the flight was \"non-eventful.\" He said that the helicopter was \"smooth,\" and there were no issues with the avionics.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the maintenance logbook revealed no open discrepancies at the time of the accident flight.&#x0D;\n - On March 10, 2019, about 1203 central daylight time, a Bell 407 helicopter, N577AL, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Galliano, Louisiana. The pilot and passenger received fatal injuries. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulation Part 135 on-demand passenger flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight originated from Bristow US LLC Heliport (2LS0), Galliano, Louisiana, about 1155, and was destined for an offshore platform in Viosca Knoll (VK956), Gulf of Mexico, about 69 nautical miles east/southeast of Venice, Louisiana. The pilot was scheduled to drop off the passenger at VK956 and then perform three additional flights.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutomatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) track data showed that the helicopter departed toward the southwest, then made a climbing left turn to an easterly heading and continued to climb for several miles, reaching a height of about 600 ft mean sea level about 1200. Around this time, the pilot of another helicopter heard the accident pilot issue a pilot report stating that ceilings were at 700 ft above ground level and visibility was 6 statute miles. The helicopter then began descending to an altitude of about 450 ft msl about 1201, crossing 50-ft-tall power lines oriented north-south. The helicopter continued eastbound while descending to about 300 ft and beginning a gradual left turn. The helicopter continued to descend to about 200 ft and turned through north along the east edge of a body of water about 1202:45. It made a slight climb to about 300 ft, and then went into a steep descent to the end of the data track. The elevation in the area was approximately 4 ft msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nData from an onboard Appareo GAU 2000 unit showed that after turning on course after takeoff, the helicopter had maintained a heading of about 090°. About 1202, a gradual left turn began with roll angles not exceeding 15° through the first 25 seconds of the turn. Over the next 25 seconds, the turn tightened, and the roll angle increased from about 15° to about 40-43°, while during this time the helicopter’s heading changes from about 070° to 320°. Nose down pitch angle increased beyond 10° to about 14° in the last 5 seconds of the flight and the maximum rate of descent was about 2,446 feet per minute about 4 seconds before the data ended at 1202:51.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1305, a company search and rescue pilot was notified of an overdue/missing aircraft. The rescue pilot stated that the weather was visual flight rules (VFR) conditions, with broken clouds above 1,000 ft and at least 10 miles visibility. The wreckage was located about 1329.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no witnesses to the accident.&#x0D;\n - An autopsy of the pilot was performed at the Jefferson Parish Forensic Center, Harvey, Louisiana. The report stated that the pilot died of multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing was performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory. Results were negative for carboxyhemoglobin and ethanol. Carvedilol and amlodipine were detected in blood and liver. Carvedilol is a prescription medication used to treat heart failure and high blood pressure. Amlodipine is a prescription medication used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. The pilot reported both medications to the FAA.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n - The Houston, Texas, Center Weather Service Unit issued several center weather advisories (CWA) during the period between 0904 through 1300 warning of low instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions over the region. The GOES-16 visible satellite image with the CWA advisory for low IFR conditions were plotted with reference to the accident site, depicted in Figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: GOES-16 visible satellite image at about 1100 with CWA 204 for LIFR conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) issued AIRMET Sierra for IFR conditions with ceilings below 1,000 ft and/or visibility less than 3 miles in mist/fog. The conditions were expected to continue beyond 1600 through 2200.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSouth Lafourche Leonard Miller Jr. Airport (GAO), Galliano, Louisiana, located about 5 miles west of the accident site, was equipped with an Automated Weather Observation System.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1215, conditions, were reported as wind 180° at 5 knots, 10 miles visibility, ceiling overcast 800 ft agl, temperature 25°C, dew point 23°C, altimeter setting of 30.12 inches Hg.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n2LS was located 7 miles west of the accident site. About the time of departure, reported conditions included wind 170° at 6 knots, 10 miles visibility or more, ceiling broken at 700 ft agl, broken clouds at 2,200 ft, temperature 24°C, dew point temperature 22°C, altimeter 30.14 inches of Hg.&#x0D;\n - According to the pilot's employment application with Air Logistics (subsequently merged with Bristow US LLC), the pilot served as a pilot in the United States Marine Corps (among other roles). He was hired in January 1990 by Air Logistics as a helicopter pilot and served as pilot-command (PIC) on Bell 47, Bell 206, Bell 209, Bell 212, Bell 407, Boelkow BO-105, EC-120, and EC-135 helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 16, 2019, the pilot received a 14 CFR Part 135.293(a) and Part 135.293(b) airman proficiency/qualification, day PIC VFR recurrency check conducted by a company check airman in a Bell 407. The checkride was 0.8 hour long, and the result of the check was satisfactory.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot did not hold authorization to act as PIC under instrument flight rules.&#x0D;\n - The wreckage was located in a brackish marsh. Terrain features in day visual meteorological conditions are depicted in Figure 2.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2: Wreckage Site Viewed Toward Northeast&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuselage was fragmented, and the transmission, main rotor hub and engine remained partially attached to the fuselage structure. Both skids were separated from the fuselage through separations consistent with overload. The wreckage exhibited signatures of a left-turning, nose-low impact attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument panel was separated from the fuselage and several of the engine instruments were separated from the panel. The panel and missing engine instruments were found underwater near the main wreckage. The attitude indicator was disassembled and found to be free moving. There were no signs of anomalies or mechanical damage were found on either the attitude indicator housing or the gyro.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the flight control system confirmed flight control continuity from the cockpit controls to the main and tail rotor systems.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCT scanning and bench testing of the hydraulic system actuators and hydraulic system pump revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor was rotated by hand, during which there was a corresponding rotation of the transmission drive shaft. The transmission chip detectors did not contain debris. The transmission oil filter was opened and no debris was noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe light bulb of the right navigation light (green-colored) revealed filament stretching.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine compressor exhibited evidence consistent with water ingestion and engine operation at operating speed. Rotation of the compressor by hand resulted in a corresponding rotation of the gas generator turbine and starter/generator. Engine continuity from the compressor through the N1 drive train was confirmed.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot departed on his first external load flight of the day; shortly thereafter, employees heard a mayday call over the company radio. The helicopter was found inverted in the designated logging area, with the cargo line attached to the cargo hook and the grapple attached to a log. Examination of the airframe and cargo hook revealed no anomalies or mechanical failures that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that the gas generator first stage sealing disk had fractured and separated into three major pieces. Multiple internal components of the engine were subsequently damaged as a result, including all four turbine rotors and nozzles. An examination of the first stage sealing disk revealed fracture features consistent with low cycle fatigue. &#x0D;\nThe overhauled engine was installed into the accident helicopter about 8 months before the accident. The sealing disk was installed into the engine at the time of overhaul and had previously accrued 1,067.3 hours and 2,134.6 cycles. &#x0D;\nThe operator had not kept an accurate documentation of engine cycles, and it was unknown who was responsible for documenting the engine cycles into the daily flight logs. A review of maintenance records and the helicopter's electronic cycle counter revealed that the sealing disk had exceeded the published life limit of 6,900 cycles. The last documented cycle value was 9,023.13. The cycle counter had recorded 12,023.19 cycles.  &#x0D;\nFollowing the sealing disk separation, and subsequent internal damage, the engine lost all power, necessitating a forced landing via autorotation. Due to the low altitude and densely tree covered terrain, it is unlikely that the pilot had reaction time to release the load which became entangled in the trees as he was attempting autorotation. &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to the US Army technical manual, 55-1520-210-10, the emergency procedure for an engine malfunction-hover is “autorotate”. The document also states, “Note: If time permits, during the autorotative descent, transmit a “May Day” call Set transponder to emergency, jettison external stores, and lock shoulder harness.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a series of emails, from April 30, 2019 to March 9, 2020, a part time pilot with the operator stated that the accident pilot could easily lift 29 logs per hour. The part-time pilot also stated that he did not track cycles in previous jobs, and it was the same for the accident operator. &#x0D;\n - The helicopter was manufactured in 1965 as a UH-1B, and after military service, was demilitarized and sold to a private company. In 1997, a Lycoming T 53-L13B engine was installed in accordance with supplemental type certificate (STC) #SR00073DE. The helicopter was purchased by the pilot on October 5, 2018.&#x0D;\nDuring an interview, the mechanic stated that it was the pilot’s responsibility to record the engine cycles accrued during the flights. Review of engine maintenance records showed that the engine was overhauled on August 1, 2017, at a time since new of 4,572.3 hours and installed onto the accident helicopter on July 2, 2018, at 5,845.0 hours Hobbs time and an airframe time of 14,859.5 hours. The engine had accumulated 1,068.1 flight hours, 30,509 turns, 294 engine starts, and 934 takeoffs since installation on the accident helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the maintenance logs revealed that the first stage sealing disk, part number 1-100-135-03, serial number 3694, was installed in the accident engine during the overhaul. The sealing disk had a historical time of 1,067.3 hours and 2,134.6 cycles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDocumentation of engine cycles was not accomplished daily. Engine cycles were documented irregularly from July 2, 2018, to September 17, 2018, after which there was no documentation of engine cycles. At the time of last documentation, the cycle count for the gas generator cumulative cycles components, which included the sealing disk, was 9,023.13 cycles. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an AKV N1/N2 cycle counter. The cycle counter was examined at AKV Inc, Camarillo, California. The unit operated normally and contained the correct software for the installed engine. The AKV cycle counter had recorded an N1 cycle count of 12,023.19 cycles. The cycle counter allowed for the operator to manually add historical values to the device, however; there was no documentation of the operator manually adding the historical cycles of the sealing disk to the cycle counter.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHoneywell Aerospace issued service bulletin (SB) T53-L-13B-0020, which stated, in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReason: &#x0D;\nTo inform operators of service life limits of rotating components in operating hours and cycles.&#x0D;\nNoncompliance may result in component failure, causing a partial or complete power loss, and the possible production of projectiles capable of serious or fatal bodily harm and property damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWARNING&#x0D;\nRotating life components have two distinct failure modes, stress rupture and low cycle fatigue, and must have two separate parameters recorded. Stress rupture is hour dependent and low cycle fatigue is cycle dependent. Components must have both hours and cycles tracked and they must be removed from service prior to exceeding the hourly or cycle limitation. Life management of these components to only one parameter is not allowed and can result in partial or complete power loss and the possible production of projectiles capable of causing serious or fatal bodily harm and /or property damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on the guidance provided by the service bulletin, the hour/cycle life limit of the first stage sealing disk was 25,000 hours or 6,900 cycles. &#x0D;\n - On March 8, 2019, at 0705 Pacific daylight time, a Richards Heavylift Helo Inc (Bell) UH-1B helicopter, N64RA, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Forks, Washington. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 external load operation.  &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nThe operator was conducting heli-logging operations using a hydraulic grapple attached to a cargo line that was secured to the helicopter by the cargo hook. The helicopter was staged at a remote location located about 1/4 mile from the accident site. Typically, the pilot would depart the staging area, fly to the logging site, establish the helicopter in an out of ground effect hover, grapple a log, and return to the staging area, where the log would be released. The pilot would repeat the process throughout the day. A part time pilot with the company stated that the cargo line they used was 180 feet in length. He stated the standing trees were about 40 to 50 feet below the helicopter when they were grappling a log.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the day of the accident, a helicopter mechanic located at the staging area assisted the pilot in the preflight inspection of the helicopter in preparation for a day of heli-logging activity. The mechanic stated that he observed a normal engine start, run-up and takeoff. The mechanic continued with his morning activities, and while walking into the maintenance support trailer, he heard three distress calls from the pilot over the company radio. Several coworkers heard the same distress calls on their radios, and they all began a search of emergency landing areas around the staging area. After finding the emergency landing areas empty, one employee hiked to the logging site and found the wreckage. (See figure 1.) &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. The helicopter at the accident site. A blue cargo line and two black hydraulic hoses can be seen running uphill to the grapple hook.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanic stated that the helicopter was fueled that morning with 1,000 pounds of Jet A fuel. He stated that he did not conduct a check of the cargo hook release that morning but had done so the day before.&#x0D;\n - The Federal Aviation Administration Forensic Sciences Laboratory performed toxicology testing on the pilot’s tissue samples, which identified famotidine, naproxen, triamterene, and pseudoephedrine in the blood (cavity) and urine. Doxylamine was detected in the urine but was inconclusive in the blood (cavity). Norpseudoephedrine, a metabolite of pseudoephedrine, was detected in the urine only.&#x0D;\nFamotidine (Pepsid) is a stomach acid suppression medication. Naproxen (Aleve or Naprosyn) is an anti-inflammatory medication. Pseudoephedrine is (Sudafed) is a nasal decongestant medication. Norpseudoephedrine is a metabolite of pseudoephedrine. These drugs are over-the-counter medications and not generally considered impairing. &#x0D;\nTriamterene is a prescription drug used to treat high blood pressure and is not generally considered impairing. Doxylamine is sedating antihistamine medication, considered by the FAA as a “do not fly” medication.&#x0D;\n - The helicopter came to rest on steep, mountainous terrain about 1/4 mile from the company’s staging area. The area was covered with felled and standing trees. All major structural components of the helicopter were located within a very small debris field around the helicopter. There was no post-crash fire. A cargo line remained attached to the cargo hook and extended uphill 180 feet to a hydraulic grapple hook. Two hydraulic fluid hoses extended from the belly of the helicopter and followed the cargo line uphill and were attached to the grapple. The grapple was resting against a standing tree and held a log in its jaws. (See figure 2.) Visual examination of the area around the grappled log revealed the grappled log rested perpendicular to the cargo line running downhill to the helicopter, and a portion of the grapple had caught the standing tree consistent with establishing an anchor point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. The grapple hook, attached to a log, and learning against a standing tree. The cargo line and two hydraulic lines are contained in a green protective sheath and run downhill to the helicopter. &#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe and cargo hook at the accident site, and again at a secure facility following recovery of the wreckage, revealed no evidence of preaccident mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The pilot’s cargo hook release button, located on the cyclic grip, was examined and functioned normally.&#x0D;\nThe engine was examined at Honeywell Aerospace on April 24, 2019; the following findings were noted. The first stage sealing disk mounted in front of the first stage gas producer turbine wheel had fragmented into three pieces and separated. Cracks were observed at all six cooling holes on the sealing disk. Damage was found on the four turbine wheels and other components downstream from the sealing disk. Magnified examination of the fracture surfaces on the sealing disk revealed multiple arc-shaped “beach mark” striations. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nFigure 3. Engine showing first stage gas producer (GP) turbine rotor with sealing disk fragment attached.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. First Stage Sealing Disk.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter pilot was using an aerial saw to trim trees along power lines. A witness reported that the pilot performed one pass, then returned for the second pass when the helicopter began to spin counterclockwise around its main rotor mast. During the second rotation, the helicopter impacted trees and terrain before coming to rest on its right side. Postaccident examination revealed a fracture of the overrunning clutch outer race and cracks on three of the engine mounts. While two of the three engine mounts cracks were likely a result of impact forces, the cracks on a third engine mount were likely present prior to the accident.  The failure of the overrunning clutch subassembly outer race resulted in a loss of power to the main rotor system. Given the helicopter's low altitude and airspeed at the time of the loss of power, the pilot was likely unable to successfully initiate and perform an autorotative landing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBefore its installation onto the helicopter, the overrunning clutch subassembly had been repaired, which included the installation of a new outer race. The accident helicopter operated with the overrunning clutch subassembly for about 33 flight hours until the accident occurred. Examination of the fracture surfaces revealed signatures consistent with fatigue and subsequent overload. The orientation of the crack in the circumferential plane was consistent with an anomalous bending load, such as an angular misalignment of the drivetrain, that drove fatigue crack initiation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDirectionality of the deformation and fracture of the center engine mount was primarily in the vertical direction and the fracture surfaces exhibited evidence of oxidation, indicating that the cracks were present before the accident. Therefore, it is likely that the damaged center engine mount was the source of the anomalous bending loads that led to fatigue crack initiation and subsequent failure of the overrunning clutch outer race.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 100-hour/annual inspection of the engine mounts could be performed with the engine installed on the airframe, and the operator had done so; however, the presence of the engine could present difficulties for a mechanic in performing a visual inspection, particularly of the forward side of the center engine mount, where the cracks were located. Maintenance records indicated that, in the 9 months preceding the accident, the engine mounts were inspected six times with no anomalies observed. However, when the engine mount cracks may have developed and whether they would have been visible during any of the previous inspections could not be determined based on the available information..&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 5, 2019, about 1110 eastern standard time, an MD Helicopters 369D, N89ZC, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Talking Rock, Georgia. The commercial pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 external load flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was using a 10-bladed aerial saw to trim trees along power lines, and was to complete three passes (upper, middle, and lower) to trim the full height of the trees. A witness reported that the pilot performed the upper pass, then returned for the middle pass when the helicopter began to rotate counterclockwise around the main motor mast. It completed one full rotation, and during the second rotation, the helicopter impacted trees and then the ground. The helicopter came to rest on its right side and sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and tailboom.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter’s main rotor was equipped with five blades that turned counterclockwise when viewed from above. The most recent 100-hr and 300-hr airframe inspections were performed on February 18, 2019, at an aircraft total time of 13,637.0 hours (2,349.0 hours Hobbs time). The Hobbs meter indicated 2,382.3 hours at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of maintenance records revealed that, before its installation on the accident helicopter, the overrunning clutch subassembly had been repaired, which included the installation of a new outer race. The overrunning clutch subassembly was installed onto the accident helicopter at the most recent inspection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the maintenance logbooks, the engine mounts were inspected during every 100-hr inspection per manufacturer guidance. The entries for six previous 100-hr inspections (July 2018 through February 2019) contained no entries related to any defects or discrepancies with the engine mounts. When the engine mounts were installed on the helicopter could not be determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nChapter 5 of MD Helicopters Maintenance Manual No. CSP-HMI-2 contained instructions for periodic, special, and conditional inspections. The engine was not required to be removed to facilitate the periodic inspection. Conditional inspections of the engine mounts were performed based on certain events, such as a hard landing or a main rotor sudden stoppage. The special inspections do not contain criteria specifically for inspecting the engine mounts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInstructions for the 100-hr or annual inspection included, in part, an inspection of the “engine mounts for cracks and play in mounting hardware at engine and airframe (retorque any loose mounting bolts).”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSection 71-20-00, \"Engine Mounts,\" of the maintenance manual provided instructions for inspecting the engine mounts and fittings. These inspections included a visual inspection for straightness and for cracks or evidence of corrosion on the tubes and welded joints. The instructions stated to magnetic particle inspect suspect engine mount assemblies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted terrain at an elevation of 1,250 ft mean sea level and came to rest on its right side on a heading of 037°. Multiple tree strikes were observed, and the helicopter struck the ground about 25 ft from the initial tree strike. All major components of the helicopter remained attached to the airframe.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was confirmed from the flight controls to the main and tail rotors. The collective control remained attached through wires to the control tube and was found in the maximum (full up) collective input position. Continuity was confirmed from the throttle to the engine through all control linkages and push-pull tubes. The electric N2 trim operated when power was applied. The lateral and longitudinal cyclic trim operated when power was applied. The fuel quantity sending unit was removed and fuel was noted in the fuel tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor transmission fluid level was verified as full using the sight glass. The engine-to-transmission driveshaft was rotated by hand and corresponding movement of the main rotor was observed. The flex frames on the engine-to-transmission driveshaft couplings were intact. Continuity of the main and tail rotor driveshafts was verified. The tail rotor driveshaft flex couplings remained attached at all attach points and the torque stripes on the bolts were unbroken.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll main rotor blades remained intact and exhibited signatures consistent with unpowered impact damage. The tail rotor transmission assembly remained attached to the tailboom. Chordwise scratching was noted on both tail rotor blades. The leading edge of one blade was impact damaged. The tail rotor driveshaft remained attached to the main transmission and was bent. The tail rotor control push-pull tube also remained attached and was bent. The tailboom was fractured about 4 ft aft of the fuselage. The tail rotor driveshaft displayed a small amount of rotational scoring. The tail rotor pitch control links remained attached. Oil was noted in the tail rotor gear box.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn inspection panel was removed in the cabin area of the fuselage to access the forward section of the engine. The compressor impeller assembly did not rotate. The N1 turbine did not rotate. The drive gear connected to the overrunning clutch could be rotated by hand. The starter generator was removed and would rotate by hand. The combustion can was removed. The first stage nozzle exhibited no sign of thermal distress, cracks, missing material, or airfoil deterioration on the nozzle guide vanes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe upper and lower chip detectors exhibited no debris. The compressor module could be rotated by hand. The governor drive shaft rotated freely and exhibited no excessive play. The fuel control was removed and the fuel control drive rotated freely. The power turbine to pinion gear (N2) rotated freely when turned by hand. Continuity of the gas producer turbine-to-compressor (N1) drive train was confirmed when rotated through the N1 tachometer generator drive pad. There were no anomalies with the engine that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe overrunning clutch housing was fractured at its attachment flange; the flange remained attached to the engine gearbox. Residual oil was found when the clutch was removed from the housing. Rotational scoring was noted on the upper bearing support of the clutch. The upper bearing exhibited grease. The overrunning clutch operated as designed when the clutch was rotated in reverse. The overrunning clutch outer race exhibited a torsional fracture on the shaft adjacent to the splines. The C-clip exhibited tension when removed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the overrunning clutch revealed that the attachment flange at the aft end of the housing was fractured, and the outer race at the aft end of the clutch subassembly was also fractured. The outer race fracture comprised a circumferential portion, a spiral portion that extended more than 360° around the circumference, and a longitudinal portion that linked between the spiral faces with features consistent with fatigue cracking. The cracks were perpendicular to the axis of rotation. The subassembly fracture surfaces revealed evidence of torsional overload. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lower arm of the left upper engine mount was fractured under tensile overload and the upper arm of the right upper engine mount was bent to the right and cracked with a compression overload failure. Neither crack in the upper left or right engine mount exhibited corrosion. Cracks were also observed on the forward surface of the center (lower) engine mount that were partially obscured by paint. The paint was removed and orange oxidation was noted on most of the crack surface. The extent of the cracking was about 25% of the center engine mount’s circumference and oriented in the vertical direction. The surface was cleaned and examination revealed that the center engine mount fracture was consistent with overload, including the areas of weld heat affected zones. There was no evidence of crack propagation on the center engine mount fracture.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine-to-transmission driveshaft was examined at the manufacturer's facility and displayed no anomalies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Atlanta, Georgia, performed the autopsy on the pilot. The autopsy report indicated the cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing of the pilot was performed at the Federal Aviation Administration Forensic Sciences Laboratory. Diphenhytramine (54 mg/dl, mg/hg) was detected in the blood; it was also detected in liver. Atropine was detected in the blood and liver; atorvastatin was detected in liver but not blood; pioglitazone was detected in liver, but not blood; and midazolam was detected in liver, and blood; no ethanol was detected in blood.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe medications detected were consistent with treatment of cholesterol and allergies and with postaccident emergency care.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The purpose of the flight was for the pilot to accrue flight-time to fulfill annual flight-time insurance requirements. Radar data indicate that, after departure, the pilot flew the helicopter generally to the south of the departure airport, where the helicopter made various low-level maneuvers and then began to follow a highway northward. The helicopter made several turns during the final two minutes of recorded radar data before the last recorded data point, which was near to the accident site. Examination of the wreckage found no evidence of any engine or airframe anomalies that may have contributed to the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, weather forecasts and advisories for the accident area predicted areas of instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and mountain obscuration and various cameras in the area captured images of low ceilings, fog, and obscuration. There was no record the pilot obtained a preflight weather briefing on the day of the accident. Had he obtained such a briefing, he likely would have been aware of the possibility of encountering below minimum weather conditions for helicopter operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot encountering IMC, subsequently becoming spatially disoriented, and losing control of the helicopter.  &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "On January 23, 2019, at 1143 Pacific standard time, a Bell 206L-3, N8227J, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Ashland, Oregon. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was operating out of Medford Airport (MFR), Medford, Oregon, with the purpose of amassing flight-time to fulfill the operator’s annual flight-time requirements. On the day prior, he had flown the accident helicopter on two different flights totaling five hours of flight time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the preliminary radar data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration disclosed that in the 1.5 hours following departure, the helicopter maneuvered in the local area west of Ashland making numerous turns. Thereafter the helicopter continued south over the Siskiyou Summit and after making various low-level maneuvers, followed Interstate 5 (I-5) toward Hilt, Oregon. Around 1120 the helicopter began to head north and made several turns and slow maneuvers. At 1141, the helicopter continued north and adjoined the I-5 for about 1.5 minutes. At 1142:50 the radar track showed that the helicopter then made several turns until heading east. The last radar return at 1143:30 was located in the immediate vicinity of the accident site and oriented about 600 ft east of the interstate at an elevation of about 4,100 ft.&#x0D;\n - Toxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified Acetaminophen, Salicylate and Pramoxine in urine samples. An autopsy of the pilot was performed by the Jackson County Office of the State Medical Examiner, Central Point, Oregon. The cause of death was listed as severe blunt trauma due to a helicopter crash. &#x0D;\n - The pilot completed a risk assessment form prior to the flight and determined it to be “low risk.” He marked the following on the form: visibility greater than 1 mile during the day, which was in the “low risk” category; icing was forecast but that the current weather indicates that conditions changed, which was a “medium risk” category; and that the ceiling was forecast and currently greater than 500 ft, which was the “low risk” category. Investigation found no evidence that the pilot obtained a weather briefing. The pilot’s papers on his kneeboard contained written notes consistent with the Medford Meteorological Terminal Air Report (METAR) issued at 0853. It was consistent with noting the freezing level at 7,000 to 11,000 ft, and broken cloud layers at 1,200 and 2,100 ft with an overcast layer at 5,000 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn employee of the operator who responded to the accident, stated that at 1400 he drove south on I-5 toward the accident (between mile marker #5 and #6). He reported that the fog was dense starting at mile marker #2 with less than 50 yards visibility. He additionally observed that the clouds/fog were coming over the summit at what seemed to be a very fast pace with the summit completely obscured. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA ski resort located approximately 5.5 nm west of the accident site had several webcams installed that captured the weather conditions immediately surrounding the time of the accident. The webcam images depicted snow covering the surface with obscured sky conditions with fog. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located south of the cold front in the warm air side of the front and immediately north of the high-pressure ridge in an area with a weak pressure gradient.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe surrounding station models on the surface analysis chart depicted calm to light southwesterly winds of 10 knots or less, overcast cloud cover, with temperatures in the upper 30’s to low 40’s degrees Fahrenheit (F), with temperature-dew point spreads of 4º F or less. Several stations northwest of the accident site over the western Cascades reported light continuous snow and rain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 12-hour Low-Level Significant Weather Prognostic Chart that depicted the expected general flight categories: cloud conditions, freezing level, and turbulence that was current at the time of the accident and valid until 1600. The chart depicted an area of instrument flight rule (IFR) conditions over northern California, western Oregon and Washington. The freezing level was depicted at approximately 8,000 ft over the Ashland area and implied the potential for icing in-clouds above that level.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGraphic Forecast for Aviation (GFA) and AIRMETs forecasts indicated that mountain obscuration and IFR conditions were expected over the area. The GFA “aviation surface forecast” image depicted visibility restrictions less than a mile during the period with AIRMET Sierra for IFR conditions over the area from 1000 and expanding at 1300 over the accident area.  The GFA “cloud cover forecast” also expected overcast clouds with bases at 3,500 ft lowering to 3,000 ft msl during the period with tops from 12,000 ft to 8,000 ft over the area, with AIRMET Sierra current for mountain obscuration conditions.&#x0D;\n - According to the operator, the pilot had amassed about 84 hours in the year proceeding the accident during 39 flights. During that time, 55.6 hours were in the accident helicopter (20 flights). &#x0D;\n - The accident site was located in the dense trees about 9 nautical miles (nm) southeast of Ashland, Oregon. In character, the terrain was composed of mature Douglas-Fir and Ponderosa Pines trees between 100-150 feet in height. The wreckage was found distributed over a 100 ft distance with no discernable flight path direction. The main rotor blades were both attached to the hub and the hub was attached to the mast. Both blades were severed chordwise approximately 5-7 feet outboard of the hub. Both tail rotor blades exhibited chordwise bending consistent with impact forces. Postaccident engine and airframe examinations revealed no mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On November 16, 2018, about 1130 central standard time, a Bell OH-58C helicopter, N510CP, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Verbena, Alabama. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The airplane was operating as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 positioning flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the mechanic, the helicopter was being repositioned to the Chilton County Airport (02A), Clanton, Alabama, for routine maintenance. On the day of the accident, the pilot departed Columbus Airport, Columbus, Georgia (CSG), then stopped at Auburn University Regional Airport (AUO) to pick up a passenger before continuing to 02A.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to witness statements, the helicopter approached a river from the east and then flew north over the river at a low altitude before doing a maneuver to head south. One witness saw the helicopter \"catch and turn\" then impact the water. Another witness reported hearing a loud explosion, and when he went to the river, the wreckage was below where the power lines were, but the power lines were no longer across the river.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the accident, a severed power line was located in the river. - The autopsy of the pilot was performed by the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, Montgomery, Alabama. The cause of death was blunt impact injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed at the Federal Aviation Administration Forensic Sciences Laboratory tested negative for carbon monoxide and ethanol. Rosuvastatin was identified in blood and urine specimens, which is a prescription cholesterol-lowering medication that is not considered impairing. - At the accident site, the Coosa River was about 1,500 ft wide; the wreckage was located midway across the river, about 700 ft from shore and about 400 ft downstream from power lines.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter main rotor hub and blades were not recovered. The main rotor mast exhibited an overstress fracture where the main rotor hub had separated from the mast; deformation of the mast was visible near this fracture. The upper wire strike protection was examined and was intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main transmission input shaft was not recovered. The freewheeling unit could be rotated in the freewheeling direction. The first segment of the tail rotor drive shaft, between the engine reduction gearbox and the oil cooler blower, was fractured but remained connected at its ends. Tail rotor control continuity was confirmed from the tail rotor blades to the forward section of the tail boom. Manipulation of the tail rotor drive shaft at the forward section of the tail boom resulted in movement of the tail rotor. In addition, continuity was confirmed from the forward section of the tail boom to the tail rotor pitch links. Tail rotor control continuity from the bellcrank forward of the main rotor transmission to aft fuselage, where the tail boom separation occurred, was confirmed through multiple overload fractures. The tail rotor blades were whole and did not exhibit impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor transmission was separated from its right-side pylon mount but remained connected to its left-side pylon mount. Both the left and right transmission pylon mounts remained installed on the airframe. The main rotor hydraulic actuators remained installed on the airframe and its attachments were secure. The main transmission input shaft coupling exhibited an overload fracture.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain rotor flight control continuity was confirmed from the main rotor swash plate and collective lever to main rotor hydraulic actuators, and subsequently to the broom closet through multiple overload fractures. Both cyclic controls were impact separated from their respective mounts but remained attached to the cockpit structure via electrical wiring through the mounts. The left collective control remained attached to the fuselage through wires. No pedal controls or the right collective control were located.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel was present in the fuel supply line to the fuel spray nozzle and no debris was noted in the fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine controls were impact separated from the engine control attachment points. The engine control on the left collective control appeared to be intact and continuous through the cable until the steel sheath was pulled, but not separated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine oil reservoir contained engine oil. The engine bleed valve could be operated by hand. The N1 and N2 turbines could not be rotated. The compressor vanes were impact damaged. A few of the 1st stage compressor blades were bent opposite the direction of travel. In addition, rotational scoring was noted on the compressor blade case. The oil cooler blower could be rotated by hand. The 1st stage power turbine blades that were examined with a borescope showed no thermal damaged. Examination of the engine did not reveal evidence of any preimpact damage, failure, or fire. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and two passengers onboard the turboshaft-powered helicopter departed from a private ranch on a night cross-country flight in visual meteorological conditions. Video evidence from witnesses who observed the departure showed that bright flood lights were shown directly at the helicopter during the departure. The helicopter impacted terrain shortly after takeoff about 100 ft below the top of a 1,500-ft hill and about 5 miles east of the departure point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn automated weather station, located 13 miles southeast of the departure site,  at 0015 recorded, clear skies, and an altimeter setting of 29.97 inHg. A review of weather information about the time of the accident revealed a small area of cloud ceilings east of the departure point. Based upon the helicopter's recorded route of flight, it is unlikely that the helicopter encountered this area of reduced visibility/ceilings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of any mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Data from the helicopter's flight displays revealed that the helicopter's altimeter was set at 30.05 inches of mercury (inHg); The altimeter setting at the station nearest the accident site was 29.97 inHg. This difference would have resulted in the helicopter's altimeter indicating a higher altitude than the helicopter's actual altitude. The display's data also indicated the helicopter's flight path towards its destination airport. The flight display's last indicated altitude was 1,538 ft, which would have only provided marginal obstacle clearance. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Additionally, the helicopter's terrain avoidance and warning system low altitude alerts were set to \"inhibit\", or turned off; therefore, the pilot would not have received a terrain warning message. Flight information from the displays did not record any evasive maneuvering, and it is likely that the pilot did not see the terrain before impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutopsy and toxicology testing of the pilot did not reveal evidence of incapacitation. A review of the pilot's medical information indicated that he had been diagnosed with early cataracts; the pilot first reported cataracts to the FAA in 2005, and it is possible that they could have increased in severity enough to have compromised his night vision and contributed to his difficulty avoiding the hill. Additionally, the pilot's eyesight may not have adjusted to the night conditions after being exposed to bright lights during departure. However, the severity of his cataracts at the time of the accident is unknown, and whether visual limitations from cataracts or bright lights contributed to the accident, could not be determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident is consistent with control flight into terrain during dark night conditions",
    "FactualNarrative": "- &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn November 3, 2018, about 2347 central standard time, a Bell 206B helicopter, N417WT, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Uvalde, Texas. The pilot and two passengers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of data from the helicopter's primary and multifunction display units revealed that the helicopter departed a private ranch about 2341 and proceeded east toward San Antonio, Texas. The data showed that the helicopter reached an altitude of 1,900 ft before beginning a gradual descent, until the final barometric altitude of 1,538 ft (indicated altitude on the display) and 74 knots airspeed. The altimeter was set for a barometric pressure of 30.05 inHg. The data did not reveal any extreme changes in pitch, bank, or airspeed. The flight display also retained the last GPS altitude, which was 1,422 ft. Additionally, the terrain awareness warning system (TAWS) and helicopter TAWS low altitude alerts were set for 140 ft above ground level; however, terrain alerts were set to \"inhibit.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Helicopter departure with flood lights shining on helicopter (Video screenshot from KSAT and Jason Martinez).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Uvalde County Sherriff's Office was notified of a possible downed aircraft northwest of Uvalde, Texas. A search effort of authorities and local volunteers found the wreckage about daybreak the following morning.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted the side of a hill about 5 miles east of the departure point and about 71 miles west of San Antonio International Airport. - The Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office, San Antonio, Texas, conducted an autopsy on the pilot. The cause of death was determined to be \"multiple blunt force injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory conducted toxicological testing of the pilot. The specimens were not tested for cyanide and carbon monoxide. The test was negative for ethanol; desmethylsildenafil was detected in the muscle and liver. Desmethylsildenafil is an active metabolite of sildenafil, which is not considered to be impairing. - &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of weather information about the time of the accident revealed a small area of cloud ceilings east of the departure point. This area of clouds dissipated and moved eastward over time. There was no indication of low-level wind shear or clear air turbulence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no record of the pilot receiving a weather briefing before departure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMoonrise occurred at 0343 and moonset at 1642 with about 19% disk illuminated. At the time of departure and the accident, the moon would have been below the horizon. - &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of previous aviation medical examinations noted a diagnosis of early cataracts; however, there was no additional information regarding the severity of the condition. - &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted about 100 ft below the apex of a hill that measured about 1,500 ft mean sea level (see figure 2). A wreckage path about 75 to 100 yards long was distributed along the hillside leading to the main wreckage. There was no post-crash fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Wreckage at the accident site (Courtesy of FAA)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hazardous terrain at the accident site precluded an on-scene examination of the helicopter; the wreckage was recovered to a secure facility for examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll major components of the helicopter were located at the accident site. The forward portion of the cabin/cockpit area was largely destroyed by impact. The tail boom remained attached to the fuselage but was twisted and damaged due to the impact. The fuel bladder remained in the fuselage and contained an undetermined quantity of fuel. The tail rotor gearbox was found several feet away from the tail boom. Both tail rotor blades were bent near the doubler but remained attached. The tail rotor was rotated by hand with no binding or anomalies noted with the tail rotor gearbox. Oil was present in the tail rotor gearbox. The tail rotor gearbox's magnetic chip detector was removed and no particles were observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub and blade assembly had separated from the main rotor mast below the main rotor hub. The main rotor mast exhibited a fracture consistent with mechanical overload. The two main rotor blades were fractured outboard of the doublers and located near the wreckage path.&#x0D;\nMain rotor drivetrain continuity was established by rotating the input drive by hand and observing the rotation of the mast. No abnormalities were noted when the transmission was rotated by hand. The transmission chip detectors were removed and no particles were observed.&#x0D;\nThe components of the hydraulic system, including the hydraulic pump, sustained various degrees of impact damage. A small amount of hydraulic fluid was present in the hydraulic oil reservoir. The three servo actuators remained attached to the roof structure, and movement was noted when manipulated by hand. No preimpact abnormalities were noted with hydraulic system. Flight control continuity could not be established due to impact damage; however, no anomalies were noted with the collective, cyclic and anti-torque pedals. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo evidence of pre-impact abnormalities were noted during the airframe examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was removed from the airframe and transported to an overhaul facility for a detailed examination. The engine was placed on a stand and disassembled. Continuity through the accessory section was established. Foreign object damage was noted to the leading edges of the intake compressor blades; also \"metal spray\" was noted on the turbine compressor wheel. The engine bleed valve and fuel nozzle were bench tested. The power turbine governor and fuel control units were sent to another facility and tested. No engine abnormalities were noted that would have restricted normal operation of the engine. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot and two crewmembers of the helicopter were performing external load operations to decommission power line structures. The crew reported that, during the first flight after their lunch break, the pilot was hovering the helicopter next to the power line structure when they heard a \"loud boom\" and \"metallic crunch\" and the crews' short haul lines were released from the helicopter. The helicopter descended and impacted the ground beneath the structure, fatally injuring the pilot, while the two crewmembers sustained minor injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The power line structure displayed an indentation consistent with impact with the top of the new steel utility pole. There was also a gouge mark to the side of the upper cap plate of the structure, consistent in shape with the indentation mark to the pole. Therefore, it is likely that the pilot failed to maintain clearance from the power line structure while hovering, resulting in contact with the structure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne lineman stated that before the impact, the pilot did not seem calm and hesitated in responding to the lineman's communications. He said that the helicopter was moving around a lot when he was attaching to the pole, and he could see the helicopter shadow and saw the tail \"darting around.\" Weather data at the time of the accident indicated the winds were 12 knots gusting to 19-25 knots from the southwest with likely unstable air from the surface up to an altitude of 400-500 ft. It is likely the pilot had difficulty maintaining the helicopter's clearance from the utility pole due to the gusty wind conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed on the pilot revealed diphenhydramine and tramadol in the pilot's blood and urine. Because both drugs undergo postmortem redistribution, the investigation could not determine whether the pilot was impaired by either drug.&#x0D;",

The cause of death was multiple traumatic injuries and drowning, and the manner of death was accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory detected the sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine at 0.037 micrograms per milliliter (µg/mL) in the pilot's blood; diphenhydramine was also detected in urine. Diphenhydramine (commonly marketed as Benadryl) is available over the counter in products used to treat colds, allergies, and insomnia. The therapeutic range is 0.025 to 0.100 µg/mL. Diphenhydramine undergoes postmortem distribution and central levels may be two to three times higher than peripheral levels.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTramadol (commonly marketed as Ultram) was detected in cavity blood at 0.058 µg/mL; tramadol and its active metabolite O-desmethyltramadol were detected in the pilot's urine. Tramadol is an opioid analgesic used to relieve moderate to severe pain. Tramadol carries the warning that it may impair mental or physical ability required for the performance of hazardous tasks. The therapeutic range for tramadol is 0.05 to 0.50 µg/mL in blood. Tramadol undergoes postmortem redistribution and there is a high degree of inter-individual variation in its distribution in the body.&#x0D;\n - Narrative fire place holder&#x0D;\n - Narrative tests and research place holder&#x0D;\n - The main wreckage came to rest on the north side of wooden and steel utility pole structures in a muddy soybean field. This area of the field was flooded with about 2 ft of water at the time of the accident due to heavy rains prior to the accident.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot, pilot-rated passenger, and two linemen were conducting a flight to temporarily install a block (a large pulley used for fiber-optic wire) on a utility pole that was part of a set of high-tension power lines. The pilot was seated in the front right seat, and one of the linemen was seated outside of the helicopter on a bench that was externally attached to the right side of the landing gear. The pilot-rated passenger, who was observing the flight for training purposes, was seated in the front left seat, and the other lineman was seated in the aft left seat. The power lines were aligned northwest/southeast, which required the pilot to approach the utility pole on a southeasterly heading so that the pole would be to the right of the pilot and lineman. For the lineman to install the block on the utility pole, the pilot had to hover the helicopter next to the pole. The wind conditions about the time of the accident were such that the helicopter would have encountered a tailwind. The pilot-rated passenger, the lineman seated in the aft left seat, and witnesses on the ground all stated that, while the helicopter was hovering next to the utility pole, the helicopter's right skid struck the pole a few times. The helicopter rolled over, became entangled in energized power lines, and caught fire. All four of the occupants survived the impact with the power lines and jumped to the ground to escape the burning wreckage. The pilot and the lineman seated on the bench did not survive the fall. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postimpact fire consumed most of the helicopter while it was entangled in the power lines, and sections of the helicopter dropped from the power lines as it burned. Examination of the wreckage and both engines revealed no preimpact mechanical deficiencies that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n The surviving lineman stated that he had flown with the pilot earlier that day and that the pilot had difficulty keeping the helicopter steady due to the strong wind, so the lineman temporarily installed a block before the helicopter returned to the base. Before the accident flight, the pilots, linemen, their foreman, the owner and a representative of the helicopter company and representatives of the linemen's employer held a safety meeting and agreed that, although the wind was too strong to fully install a block, the wind was \"okay\" to temporarily install another block. Given that the pilot had difficulty holding the helicopter steady while hovering with a tailwind on the previous flight the pilot most likely also had difficulty hovering the helicopter with the tailwind that was present about the time of the accident. The helicopter's subsequent impact with the utility pole resulted in a dynamic rollover into the power lines.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-21B, states the following on pages 11-11 and -12: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA helicopter is susceptible to a lateral rolling tendency, called dynamic rollover…. For dynamic rollover to occur, some factor must cause the helicopter to roll or pivot around a skid or landing gear wheel until its critical rollover angle is reached…. Then, beyond this point, main rotor thrust continues the roll and recovery is impossible…. If the critical rollover angle is exceeded, the helicopter rolls on its side regardless of the cyclic corrections made. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDynamic rollover begins when the helicopter starts to pivot laterally around its skid or wheel…. This can occur for a variety of reasons, including the failure to remove a tie-down or skid securing device, or if the skid or wheel contacts a fixed object while hovering sideward, or if the gear is stuck in ice, soft asphalt, or mud…. Once started, dynamic rollover cannot be stopped by application of opposite cyclic control alone. - The Aerospatiale AS355 was a twin-engine light-utility helicopter equipped with two Rolls-Royce 250-C20F engines. The last 100-hour inspection was completed on October 28, 2018, with a total airframe time of 9,904.3 hours. The left engine had a total time of 11,611.4 hours and 1,640.9 hours since overhaul. The right engine had a total time of 8,114.9 hours and 1,684.2 hours since overhaul. According to the operator, the helicopter had flown less than 1 hour between the time of the inspection and the time of the accident. - On October 30, 2018, about 1611 eastern daylight time, an Aerospatiale AS355F2, N372CA, was destroyed when it collided with a wooden utility pole and power lines while conducting power line construction operations near Beekmantown, New York. The airline transport pilot and a lineman were fatally injured, and the pilot-rated passenger and another lineman sustained serious injuries. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Catalyst Aviation, LLC, and was being operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 external load operation. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed for the local flight that departed from a designated landing zone near Plattsburgh, New York, at 1602.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe power lines the crew was working on were supported by two 75-ft-tall wooden utility poles connected by a wooden horizontal bar and two wooden cross bars. The horizontal bar was installed about 6.5 ft below the top of the two poles. The power lines were oriented northwest/southeast. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a bench (platform) that was attached externally on the right side of the right landing gear. A lineman would sit on the bench while performing his duties. The pilot, who was seated in the front right seat, would position the helicopter on the left side of the utility pole so that the lineman would be able to accomplish work.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe two helicopter occupants who survived the accident, the pilot-rated passenger and one of the lineman, as well as two witnesses on the ground, provided their accounts of the circumstances surrounding the accident to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the New York State Police. The pilot-rated passenger, who was seated in the front left seat, was observing the flight for training purposes. He stated that the pilot was the only one operating the controls at the time of the accident. The pilot-rated passenger recalled that the helicopter approached the utility pole and got caught in the power lines; the helicopter struck the utility pole twice and rolled inverted. The pilot-rated passenger stated that his next memory was that he was upside down, the helicopter was on fire, and he had to unbuckle his harness and jump to the ground. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the lineman who was seated in the aft left seat, he had flown earlier that day with the pilot to install a block (a large pulley used for fiber-optic wire) on one of the utility poles. During that flight, as the helicopter approached the pole, the pilot had a hard time keeping the helicopter steady because the \"..wind was too strong,\" so all we did was temporarily place the pulley on the wire\" and then returned to the base. During the flight, the lineman sent a text message to his foreman that stated, \"[the pilot] is very good. He just has horrible tailwind on the side we actually need to be on.\" He said that after they landed, two more flights were conducted with different linemen taking turns practicing out on the bench. Once these flights were completed, all the lineman, their foreman, the pilot, pilot rated passenger, and \"everyone\" from the operator [owner of Catalyst and her husband, a helicopter test pilot, who was assisting in overseeing the operation] held a \"tailboard\" meeting. He said, \"This was a meeting for everyone to discuss the previous flights, review the upcoming flights including a safety briefing. During this meeting, the pilot said it was too windy to fully install a block, which would require him to hover about 5-7 minutes. However, the conditions were okay to just temporarily hang the block, which would take about 30 seconds. The entire team agreed that this would be what they would do. The lineman said they departed with the pilot-rated passenger seated in the front left seat, the pilot in the front right seat, the other lineman was on the bench, and he was seated in the aft left seat. The lineman said he could see everything that occurred during the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe said that, as the helicopter approached the utility pole, the other lineman on the bench was getting ready to install the block. The helicopter hovered for about 5 seconds so that the lineman could place the block on the line, and then the helicopter skid hit the pole three times. The surviving lineman indicated that the helicopter hit the pole \"real hard\" the third time and that the helicopter then rolled upside down into the wires and caught fire. The lineman exited the burning helicopter by jumping to the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe linemen's foreman said that at the meeting prior to the accident flight he gave a sheet of all the block sizes to the husband of the owner of the helicopter company, who performed a weight and balance calculation. Once it was determined how many blocks could be taken on the accident flight, the pilot, pilot-rated passenger, and both linemen departed with the purpose to temporarily install the block. The foreman took a picture of the helicopter as it departed (time stamped at 1602) and then drove to the work site to observe the operation. The foreman said he arrived just as the helicopter was making its 45 ° approach to the power line structure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the helicopter got into place, the helicopter's right skid was almost even with the top of the pole. The foreman said the lineman on the bench connected the static line, opened the gate for the block, and placed the block on the power line. As the lineman was trying to close the gate of the block, the helicopter's right skid struck the pole. The helicopter pulled away and then struck the pole harder a second time. The helicopter then struck the pole a third time and immediately rolled over to the right, and the main rotor blades struck the adjacent static line and top of the other pole. The body of the helicopter became entangled in the energized (115 KVA) power lines and caught fire. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe husband of the owner of the helicopter company also witnessed the accident. He stated that the helicopter made a slow approach to the left side of the pole on a southeasterly heading (about 120°) and that the engines were operating normally. As the helicopter got into place near the pole, the lineman on the bench began to install the block. The helicopter then slid to the left and slid back to the right. The witness thought the helicopter's right skid had struck the pole because the helicopter immediately rolled over to the right. The main rotor blades then struck the top of the utility pole, and the helicopter became entangled in the power lines and caught fire. This witness saw all four helicopter occupants jump from the burning wreckage.  He was not sure why the helicopter struck the pole and said it may have been the wind or just an overcorrection by the pilot. - An autopsy of the pilot was conducted by the Champlain Valley Physician Hospital Department of Pathology, Plattsburgh, New York. The pilot's cause of death was determined to be multiple organ trauma due to a fall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and all tested drugs. - Plattsburgh International Airport, Plattsburgh, New York, which was about 6 miles southeast of the accident site, was the nearest weather reporting station. At 1553, the reported weather was wind from 290° at 7 knots, visibility 10 miles, overcast ceiling at 3,100 ft, temperature 4°C, dew point -2°C, and an altimeter setting of 30.06 inches of mercury. - The pilot, who was also the Director of Operations for the operator's Part 135 certificate, held an airline transport pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, instrument airplane, rotorcraft-helicopter, and rotorcraft-helicopter instrument. A review of the pilot's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airman records, revealed that his most recent first-class medical certificate was issued on August 22, 2018. At that time, he reported a total of 16,500 total flight hours. The operator reported that his last flight review occurred on October 16, 2018 in the same make/model helicopter as the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot-rated passenger held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and rotorcraft-helicopter instrument. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on January 19, 2018, with no limitations. The operator reported that he had 2,000 hours of total flight experience, of which 300 hours were in the same make and model as the accident helicopter. - A postimpact fire consumed most of the helicopter after it became entangled in the energized power lines, and sections of the helicopter dropped from the power lines as it burned. Found below the power lines were a portion of the cockpit, including the pilot and copilot seats; the main rotor system and all three main rotor blades; the combiner gearbox, which remained attached to the main transmission gearbox; the tailboom; and both engines. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot and copilot seats were extensively fire damaged, and the aft seating area had been consumed by fire. The pilot's cyclic hand grip was mostly consumed by fire, and the electrical wires were exposed. Collective movement on both the pilot and copilot sides was consistent with corresponding movement with the partially severed control tube below the cabin floor. The left aft sliding doors and the forward windscreen exhibited fire damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the main rotor system revealed that the red and blue pitch change links remained attached to the pitch change horn and rotating swashplate. The yellow blade detached from the rotating swashplate and pitch change horn. A section of the blue blade had separated about three-quarters out from the blade root. The red blade exhibited full-length integrity with separation of the outer skin surface. The yellow blade was separated about five-eighths out from the blade root. The starflex arm sheared from all three rotor blades. The scissor link and collective collar remained attached to the rotating swashplate. All rotor blades were attached to the upper and lower sleeves via their respective attachment bolts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main transmission and the combiner gearbox had separated from the airframe and appeared to be undamaged. The bilateral suspension remained attached, and the left-side combiner gearbox input had sheared. The other end of the sheared section remained attached to the No.1 engine. Two hydraulic reservoirs were found crushed and without fluid, but fluid was observed at the base of the transmission. The hydraulic pumps were attached to the combiner gearbox, and the hydraulic actuators remained attached to the stationary swashplate. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom separated from the main body of the helicopter and exhibited impact and fire damage. Examination of the tail rotor revealed that both blades were attached to their respective pitch change links, rotor drive shaft, and 90° gearbox. One blade was embedded about 2 inches into the ground, and the other blade appeared undamaged. The vertical fin remained attached and exhibited impact damage. The right horizontal stabilizer was partially embedded in the ground and exhibited impact damage. No fluid was observed in the sight gauge. The magnetic plug was removed and was absent of debris/obstructions. The top portion of the tail rotor drive shaft cover exhibited scuff marks about 4 ft from the aft handling bars. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's landing gear remained caught in the power lines and was later removed by the New York Power Authority. The landing gear exhibited fire damage, but the forward and rear airframe mounting sleeves were intact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the No. 1 engine revealed that the entire engine bay had been consumed by the postcrash fire, which also melted sections of the auxiliary gearbox and several other smaller components. The engine combustor showed significant impact damage. The power turbine governor was heat damage and was contaminated with melted aluminum. The fuel control unit was intact, but the control arm could not be manually manipulated. The bleed valve was manually operated, and the valve poppet moved smoothly along its normal stroke with no lateral play.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe compressor was heat damaged, and the composite liner had melted and left ashen debris throughout the compressor. No evidence of significant foreign object debris (FOD) was observed on the compressor blades, but the blade tips exhibited some minor bending. Neither the N1 nor the N2 rotor system could be manually rotated. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe No. 2 engine was partially buried in mud and was covered by the burned fuselage debris. The engine was damaged by the postcrash fire. The power turbine governor was partially consumed by fire, and the fuel control unit was impact and fire damaged. The bleed valve was mostly consumed by fire and was liberated from the compressor module. The compressor was heat damaged, and the composite liner had melted and left ashen debris throughout the compressor. The compressor exhibited extensive FOD damage and rotational scoring. Neither the N1 nor the N2 rotor system could be manually rotated. For the turbine module of each engine, visual examination of the fourth stage (power turbine) revealed no evidence of FOD, operational damage, or thermal degradation. Each engine's fuel spray nozzle was removed to permit a borescope examination of the first stage (gas generator turbine). The examination revealed no evidence of FOD or thermal degradation of the first stage nozzle or turbine blades. A small amount of fuel was found in each fuel spray nozzle, which was absent of debris and water. On the No. 2 engine turbine module, shiny metal splatter adhered to the turbine nozzle shield, which was consistent with FOD damage to the compressor (specifically, debris that was melted and deposited within the turbine module). The spray face of the fuel spray nozzle was intact and covered with soot. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of both turbine engines revealed no mechanical deficiencies that would have precluded normal operation at the time of the accident. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was on a scheduled pipeline patrol observation flight in a turboshaft-powered helicopter. When the pilot did not arrive at his destination, an alert notice was issued for the overdue helicopter. The helicopter wreckage was located about 22 miles west of the helicopter's departure point in a remote wooded area that was about 200 yards north of the east-west pipeline. The pilot was not in contact with air traffic control during the flight, and there was no record of a distress call. A witness working on the pipeline about 2 to 3 miles from the accident site, reported seeing the helicopter fly overhead and further reported that the helicopter looked and sounded \"normal.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVisual meteorological conditions surrounded the area of the accident with 10 miles visibility and an overcast sky at 1,600 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe post-crash fire consumed most of the cabin area, which limited the scope of the airframe and engine examinations. Additionally, fire damage prevented the retrieval of information from the helicopter's cockpit image and flight data monitoring system, including nonvolatile memory from the digital engine control unit and engine data recorder. However, no preimpact abnormalities were noted during the engine or airframe examinations. Further, the engine's intake axial compressor blades exhibited damage near the outer tips, and the module 5 torque nut had a slippage of about 1/16 to 1/8 inch, (2 to 4 millimeters) consistent with the engine producing power at the time of impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's autopsy noted moderate-to-severe coronary artery disease, scarring of the heart muscle from a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), and changes in the blood vessels of the liver that were indicative of congestive heart failure. Thus, the pilot would have been at an increased risk for an acute coronary event causing symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, or fainting. The pilot's complete medical history was not available, and a determination of medical impairment or incapacitation could not be made based on the available evidence for the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "An iPhone and iPad were recovered from the accident site and sent to the NTSB's Vehicle Recorder Division for download of non-volatile memory (NVM). Both units were damaged, and no information could be gleaned from the iPad. Information about text and e-mail messages, photographs, and telephone calls was found on the iPhone.   Several photos were recovered from the iPhone that had been taken earlier in the day.  The photos indicated the pilot photographed ground activity near the pipeline and of routine engine power checks,but none of the information was pertinent to the accident. - The helicopter, a Eurocopter AS350 B3 (present designation: Airbus H125), had a three-bladed main rotor system that rotated in a clockwise direction, with the three main rotor blades attached to a Starflex rotor head. The helicopter was powered by a (Safran) Turbomeca Arriel 2D turboshaft engine. Although the helicopter was equipped with a long-range fuel cell, it was not connected to the helicopter's fuel system. The helicopter received 120 gallons of fuel before departing IWD. The helicopter was also equipped with an Appareo Vision 1000 cockpit image and flight data monitoring system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was maintained under the manufacturer's maintenance inspection program. A review of the maintenance records revealed the helicopter's last inspection was completed on October 26, 2018, with a total airframe time of 2,965.7 hours. At the time of the inspection, the engine had accumulated 2,965.2 total hours and 1,483 cycles. - On October 29, 2018, about 1345 central daylight time, a Eurocopter (Airbus) AS350 B3 helicopter, N910S, impacted terrain near Odanah, Wisconsin. The pilot was fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Enbridge Energy Company, Inc., as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 aerial observation fight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight departed Gogebic-Iron County Airport (IWD), Ironwood, Michigan, about 1300 and was en route to Madison, Wisconsin.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight was scheduled as a routine pipeline patrol flight. Two pipeline employees who were working on the pipeline about 2 to 3 miles from the accident site reported seeing the helicopter flying overhead. One of the employees, who had seen pipeline helicopters flying overhead numerous times, stated that he saw \"nothing unusual about the helicopter\" and heard \"no unusual sounds coming from the helicopter.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the pilot did not arrive at his intended destination, an alert notice was issued for the overdue helicopter. The pilot had not been in contact with air traffic control during the flight, and there was no record of a distress call from the pilot.The helicopter wreckage was subsequently located about 22 miles west of IWD in a remote wooded area and about 200 yards north of the east-west pipeline. - An autopsy on the pilot was performed by the Midwest Medical Examiner's Office, Ramsey, Minnesota. The pilot's cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries. The autopsy noted moderate to severe coronary artery diseasescarring of the heart muscle from a previous myocardial infarction (heart attack), and changes in the blood vessels of the liver that were indicative of congestive heart failure&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed at the Federal Aviation Administration Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol and all tested drugs. - At 1356, the automated weather observing system at IWD recorded wind from 300° at 6 knots, 10 miles visibility, overcast sky at 1,600 ft, temperature 41°F, dew point 36°F, and altimeter setting 30.02 inches of mercury. - The pilot was a Canadian citizen and held a Canadian commercial pilot certificate with helicopter and instrument ratings. He also held a Canadian private pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land and instrument ratings and a US private pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating (based on the pilot's Canadian license). The pilot held a Canadian category 1 medical certificate. His last medical exam was conducted on October 1 2018; however, the last medical exam and certificate on file with Transport Canada was dated March 12, 2018.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that the pilot had 16,894 hours of total flight experience with 16,535 hours in helicopters, 693 hours of which were in the AS350. The pilot had flown 208 hours in the AS350 during the preceding 90 days before the accident. - The helicopter impacted trees and terrain before it came to rest in an upright position within the trees. Several trees at the crash site showed cuts, and one tree with a diameter of about 10 to 12 inches was completely severed in half. Except for small fragments of plexiglass, the helicopter wreckage was confined to the impact/resting site.The front of the cabin and the cockpit area were mostly destroyed by impact forces and a post-crash fire.  The major helicopter components were located at the accident site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was examined on scene by the NTSB investigator-in-charge, and technical representatives from the engine and airframe manufacturers. The flight control continuity inspection was limited due to fire damage, but the bolt connections to the actuators were confirmed. The tail rotor pitch control moved freely: the tail rotor flex cable was attached and ran forward and under the fire-damaged cabin floor. The cyclic and anti-torque pedals were connected to their respective tubes beneath the floor but were destroyed under the cabin area.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's Appareo Vision system was located within the wreckage; however, the unit was badly fire damaged, and no data could be retrieved from the unit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine received extensive fire and impact damage. The engine 's intake axial compressor blades exhibited damage near the outer tips, and the module 5 torque nut had a slippage of about 1/16 to 1/8 inch (2 to 4 millimeters), consistent with engine power at the time of impact. The digital engine control unit and engine data recorder were removed and sent to a laboratory for download.  However, no data could be extracted from the units because they were badly fire damaged.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor blades were broken but remained attached; paint transfer and impact scars were consistent with the tail rotor blades impacting the stabilizer. The three main rotor blades remained with the wreckage and exhibited impact and fire damage.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThough the examination was limited by thermal and impact damage to the helicopter, no preimpact abnormalities were noted during the airframe or engine examinations. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was conducting a solo cross-country flight in the helicopter as part of his instruction to obtain his rotorcraft rating. The intent of the flight was to fly solo cross-country to perform touch and go landings at another airport. About 36 minutes after departing on the flight, the helicopter impacted terrain. One witness reported that he saw the helicopter flying and heard the engine stop. He stated that the helicopter began to lose altitude and began to spin in a downward spiral. Another witness reported that he observed the helicopter flying toward him with its nose pointed downward about 45°. He stated that the blades were turning slowly and that the helicopter was making a circular motion along its axis, but not a spiral, as it flew toward the ground. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted terrain in a nose-low, left-skid-down attitude. Examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any mechanical pre-impact anomalies. The main rotor blade damage was consistent with low rotor rpm at the time of impact, and the low rotor rpm caution light filament was stretched, consistent with the light being illuminated at the time of impact. Examination of the rotating engine components did not reveal any evidence consistent with rotation at the time of impact. The carburetor heat control in the cockpit was found unlocked and found in the \"on\" position. According to a carburetor icing probability chart, the atmospheric conditions about the time of the accident were conducive to moderate icing at cruise power settings and serious icing at descent power settings. Thus, it is likely that the helicopter experienced a loss of engine power due to carburetor ice accumulation. Although the carburetor heat was found in the on position, it is likely that the pilot applied the carburetor heat to address the loss of engine power but it was too late and at too low an altitude to restore engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the loss of engine power, the main rotor rpm would have rapidly begun to deteriorate unless the pilot immediately reduced collective and entered an autorotation. Given the signatures of low rotor rpm present at the site, it is likely that the pilot failed to initiate the autorotation in a timely manner, which allowed the main rotor rpm to deteriorate to the extent that the main rotor stalled and the pilot would be unable to recover.",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to information provided by the operator, the helicopter departed Moscow Mills with 28 gallons of fuel onboard. Information published by the manufacturer indicated that the helicopter consumed between 7 and 10 gallons of fuel per hour. - On October 17, 2018, about 1421 central daylight time, a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter, N923SH, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Fulton, Missouri. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 solo instructional flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the pilot had been receiving instruction toward his rotorcraft-helicopter rating. The intent of the flight was to fly solo from Moscow Mills, Missouri, to Columbia Regional Airport (COU), Columbia, Missouri, and perform touch-and-go landings at COU. The helicopter departed Moscow Mills about 1345 and impacted terrain about 36 minutes later while on a direct route to COU.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne witness reported that he saw the helicopter flying and heard the engine stop. He stated that the helicopter began to lose altitude and spin in a downward spiral. Another witness reported that he observed the helicopter flying toward him with its nose pointed downward about 45°. He stated that the blades were turning slowly and that the helicopter was making a circular motion along its axis, but not a spiral, as it flew toward the ground. There were no distress calls from the pilot and no radar information was available for the flight. - The Boone/Callaway County Medical Examiner's Office, Columbia, Missouri, performed an autopsy of the pilot. The pilot's cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries. No significant natural disease was noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Forensic Sciences Laboratory performed toxicology testing on the pilot's tissue samples. The toxicology tests were negative for drugs and ethanol.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nRobinson Helicopter Company Safety Notice SN-24, \"Low RPM Rotor Stall Can Be Fatal,\" stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotor stall is very similar to the stall of an airplane wings at low airspeeds. As the airspeed of an airplane gets lower…the angle of attack of the wing must be higher for the wing to produce the lift required to support the weight of the airplane…The same thing happens during rotor stall with a helicopter except it occurs due to low rotor RPM instead of low airspeed. As the RPM of the rotor gets lower, the angle of attack of the rotor blades must be higher to generate the lift required to support the weight of the helicopter…Even if the collective is not raised by the pilot to provide the higher blade angle, the helicopter will start to descend until the upward movement of air to the rotor provides the necessary increase in blade angle of attack…The increased drag on the blades acts like a huge rotor brake causing the rotor RPM to rapidly decrease, further increasing the rotor stall. As the helicopter begins to fall, the upward rushing air continues to increase the angle of attack on the slowly-rotating blades, making recovery virtually impossible, even with full down collective. - According to a carburetor icing probability chart, the atmospheric conditions were conducive to moderate icing at cruise power settings and serious icing at descent power settings. - The pilot had a rotorcraft endorsement for solo flight in the R22 helicopter. - The helicopter wreckage was found in a grassy area in a slight depression in the Potowatami recreational area near Fulton, MO. Initial examination of the wreckage at the accident site showed evidence that the helicopter impacted in a nose-low, left-skid-down attitude. Most of the helicopter wreckage was found resting on its left side, in a 6-foot-wide, 2-foot-deep crater. Portions of the wreckage were partially embedded in the dirt. All components were identified at the accident site, with small pieces of debris and plexiglass from the windscreen located within 30 ft of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDamage to the main rotor blades was consistent with low rotor rpm at the time of impact. The low rotor rpm annunciator light was examined with a 10x magnifier and showed stretched filaments consistent with it being illuminated at the time of impact. Examination of the airframe components, flight controls, and main and tail rotor drive systems did not reveal any mechanical pre-impact anomalies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor heat control in the cockpit was unlocked and bent flush with the console about 1 inch up (in the \"on\" position). The carburetor heat slider  valve was about 1.4-inches open at the carburetor.  The main fuel tank was severely impact-damaged and ruptured. A small amount of fuel was present in the auxiliary tank. The carburetor was disassembled, and the float bowls were wet but contained no fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was successfully rotated from the crankshaft to the gearbox. Thumb compression was confirmed on all four cylinders. Engine continuity was confirmed from the crankshaft to the engine accessory gears to the fan. The dowel pin (locator pin) on the crankshaft gear was not sheared. There were both imprint marks and score marks on the oil cooler from the starter ring gears. The score marks were slightly angled and aft of the imprint marks. There were imprints on the cooling panels adjacent to the ring gear on the engine right (aircraft left side). There was no evidence of contact between the alternator fan and the engine, and no evidence of rotational scoring marks on the fan or fan scroll. There was a dent on the left side of the upper frames adjacent to the upper sheave, but no evidence of rotational scoring. No mechanical pre-impact anomalies were observed during the engine examination. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The private pilot had just purchased the helicopter and was returning it to his home airport accompanied by a commercial-certificated safety pilot and two passengers. Video from the cockpit image recorder indicated that the pilot, seated in the right seat, was manipulating the flight controls from takeoff until the accident occurred. The surviving passenger stated that, while en route, the pilot indicated that they would be landing on a beach in order to stretch their legs. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe recovered data showed the helicopter flying about 500 to 700 ft over water when the pilots began conversing and pointing toward the shore. The safety pilot, whose hands were on his lap, then raised his right hand in a manner that appeared that he was guarding the cyclic control in anticipation that his assistance or intervention might be required. Shortly thereafter, the pilot twisted the collective twist grip throttle from FLIGHT to IDLE; data from the engine data recorder (EDR) indicated that, at this time, the engine fuel control was set to the idle power setting. Such action is consistent with a practice autorotation. The collective control was adjusted downward slightly, but the main rotor speed (Nr) gauge showed Nr decay from the normal \"green\" operating range of 375 to 405 rpm to the \"yellow\" cautionary range of 320 to 375 rpm about 5 seconds after the twist grip was set to IDLE. An Nr value of less than 360 rpm would have resulted in a continuous aural tone to alert the pilots of the low rotor speed. About 7 seconds after the twist grip was set to IDLE, the pilot reached toward the center console, after which the \"HORN\" caution light illuminated, consistent with the pilot muting the aural tone signaling the low Nr condition. After the horn was muted, Nr continued to decay to a low of 254 rpm. Several small cyclic inputs were observed, then the recorded data ended. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted the water and was destroyed. The four occupants were ejected from the helicopter; one of the passengers survived the accident and swam to shore. Postaccident examination of the helicopter and the recovered data did not reveal any helicopter malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSince recorded cockpit imagery did not capture microphone audio, the reason for the pilot's decision to roll the throttle to IDLE could not be determined, and what conversations the pilots may have had before and during the maneuver could not be determined. The passengers' headphones were muted from the pilots' conversation, and the surviving passenger did not know if they planned to practice an autorotation to the beach. Cockpit video recordings from previous flights indicated that the safety pilot did not guard the flight controls when the pilot was performing takeoffs or landings. It is plausible that the pilot's intention was to practice or perform an autorotation to the beach, with the safety pilot guarding the controls. However, the beach was not the most suitable location for a practice autorotation to landing procedure and was out of the ordinary from their previous flights, as observed on the recorded cockpit imagery. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the twist grip throttle is set to IDLE position during normal flight, Nr will decay unless the pilot takes action to maintain it, such as a reduction in main rotor collective pitch or returning the twist grip throttle to the FLIGHT position.  However, after the throttle was set to IDLE, the pilot failed to reduce main rotor collective pitch, which resulted in low rotor rpm. The pilot's action of muting the low rotor rpm alert horn indicated that he was aware of the annunciation to an anomalous condition, but it could not be determined if the pilot understood the nature of why the horn annunciated or the criticality of the situation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to the helicopter's RFM, the bleed valve is normally open when the engine is shut down, during starting, and at low power settings. The bleed valve open indicator, displayed as a solid green-colored flag with two vertical white stripes, appears above the FLI when the bleed valve is open. The bleed valve open indicator disappears when the bleed valve closes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel Sample&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImmediately after the accident, a manager at the fixed based operator at JNU where the helicopter had refueled secured a fuel sample from their fuel supply. The sample was tested for water and visible contaminants; no water or other contamination was found.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAppareo Vision 1000&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of additional images from the unit showed that during the most recent flights preceding the accident flight, the safety pilot did not guard the cyclic or collective while the pilot was executing a takeoff or landing maneuver.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutorotation Procedures&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn an autorotation maneuver, after the removal of engine power, whether due to engine failure or intentional throttle reduction, the pilot is required to manipulate the flight controls in order to maintain Nr and a normal attitude during the autorotative descent. The primary means to control Nr during an autorotation is the collective control. Excessive Nr can result in a main rotor overspeed, and an increase in collective pitch is required to reduce Nr to the required range. If Nr becomes too slow, a decrease in collective pitch is required to increase Nr to the required range.&#x0D;\nSupplement 6 of the AS350 B3e RFM contained procedures for autorotation landing training. According to Supplement 6, in the event of an engine failure or a loss of engine power, \"the helicopter will yaw to the right, some red warnings may come on associated with the gong audio warning, the Nr will decay, and the low Nr audio warning will sound if Nr goes below 360 rpm.\" A loss of engine power could be simulated by setting the twist grip to the IDLE detent, which would produce the same symptoms as that of an actual engine failure or loss of engine power. A note within the emergency procedures of Supplement 6 stated that, \"if necessary, it is possible to quickly turn the twist grip back to the FLIGHT position at any time and for any Nr value.\" - The Airbus Helicopters was equipped with a three-bladed main rotor system and a two-bladed tail rotor system. The flight controls are were hydraulically assisted by a dual hydraulic system. The helicopter was equipped with both pilot and safety pilot controls and a Genesys Aerosystems HeliSAS autopilot and stability augmentation system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe collective-mounted engine control twist grip throttle contains two positions: IDLE and FLIGHT. In the normal procedures section of the AS350 B3e rotorcraft flight manual (RFM), the twist grip throttle is moved from the IDLE position to the FLIGHT position during the run-up checks. The twist grip throttle remains in the FLIGHT position until the postlanding engine and rotor shutdown procedures are performed. When the twist grip throttle is outside of its FLIGHT position, a \"TWT GRIP\" warning light illuminates on the cockpit caution and warning panel (CWP).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Airbus Helicopters, the airframe and engine had accumulated a total time of 13.7 hours at the time of delivery. An estimated 25-30 hours was accumulated from delivery until the accident. - Appareo Vision 1000&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an Appareo Vision 1000 cockpit image and data recorder at the time of manufacture. The unit was capable of recording images, audio, GPS coordinates, and pitch, roll, yaw and acceleration data. The unit was mounted in the aft center ceiling of the cockpit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe unit recorded images, ambient audio, and parametric data for the entire accident flight. The field of view included over-the-shoulder images of the forward cockpit, including both cyclic controls and the right seat collective and pedal controls, along with most of the instrument panel and a view out the lower forward portion of the windscreen. The unit did not record any radio or microphone audio; only engine and transmission noises could be heard for the duration of the recording.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe following excerpts are a summary of the Vision 1000 contents beginning at 10:46:00. &#x0D;\nAt 10:46:00, the helicopter continued northwest along the coastline at 650 ft msl with rain visibly impacting the windscreen.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:50:42, the pilot's left hand manipulated his boom mic near his mouth and then made an arcing hand motion to the right. The safety pilot looked over at the pilot. About this time, rainfall on the windscreen diminished. About 10:53:00, the pilot made another series of hand gestures, the safety pilot continued to look in the direction of the pilot. At 10:53:20, the pilot made another series of hand gestures in which he pointed to the right.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 10:54:00, the safety pilot picked up his iPhone and manipulated the map screen on the ForeFlight app. The map screen showed the helicopter's GPS location inside the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), just south of Lituya Bay, Alaska. At 10:55:20, the pilot made some additional gestures with his left hand, the safety pilot looked in the direction of the pilot. There were no more hand gestures from the pilot; however, the safety pilot was actively looking to the right of the helicopter toward the shoreline.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:00, the helicopter was flying straight and level on a heading of 300° at an altitude of 590 ft msl and a groundspeed of 114 knots. There were no indications illuminated on the helicopter's CWP or any anomalous engine instrument indications.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe safety pilot was sitting with his hands on his knees and his feet flat on the floorboard. The pilot had his right hand on the base of the cyclic grip and his left hand was resting on his left knee. At 10:57:20, the safety pilot looked in the direction of the shoreline and moved his mouth as if he were making a comment.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:34.75, the rotor speed (Nr) gauge indicated about 395 rpm, the first limit indicator (FLI) on the VEMD indicated about 8.5 FLI, the fuel gauge indicated about ¾ full, engine parameter indicator gauges were in the normal range and the autopilot system was inactive. Parametric data indicated the helicopter was pitched forward approximately 6° nose down; roll attitude was level. GPS data showed the helicopter at 618 ft msl and 116 knots groundspeed. The pilot moved his left hand off of his left knee and onto the twist grip portion of the collective control. About the same time that the pilot gripped the twist grip, the safety pilot moved his left hand out of view to his left and also moved his right hand into a ready position, hovering it near his cyclic control grip. At this point, the safety pilot's left hand was not visible on the video. Before this moment, the safety pilot had not previously hovered his hands near the flight controls at any time in the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:35.25, using his left hand, the pilot rotated the twist grip out of the FLIGHT detent to the IDLE position. The twist grip red warning light illuminated on the CWP. The pilot repositioned his left hand on the twist grip, but the collective control position remained unchanged. The safety pilot was still hovering his right hand near his cyclic control and his feet remained flat on the floor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:38.50, the FLI had dropped to a value of 7 and a green bleed valve indicator light (see the NOTE in ADDITIONAL INFORMATION) illuminated on the VEMD. A sound consistent with engine deceleration was audible on the Appareo ambient audio recording. Nr began decreasing just below 390 rpm. The pilot slightly lowered the collective. The pitch attitude of the helicopter was 3.6° nose down, groundspeed was 115 knots, and altitude was 627 ft msl. The pilot began a slight left pedal input. The safety pilot's position had not changed from the last observation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the next seven frames (1.75 seconds, 10:57:40.25), the FLI needle decreased to 1.75 FLI and the Nr gauge indicated 328 rpm. The twist grip remained in the IDLE position and the pilot had input a small amount of left pedal. Engine parameter indicator gauges were in the normal range. The helicopter was at 630 ft msl and 112 knots groundspeed with 8° pitch nose down and a level roll attitude. The safety pilot still had his feet flat on the floor, but now raised his right arm away from his grip and motioned with his right thumb in a pointing manner in the direction of the shoreline, to the right of the helicopter. The shoreline was visible in the upper right corner of the camera's view. Five frames later (1.25 seconds, 10:57:41.50), the FLI had decreased to 1.25 FLI and the Nr gauge indicated 300 rpm. The twist grip remained in the IDLE position. The pilot's left pedal input had not changed. The pilot's left hand then moved off of the collective control and reached up toward the horn on/off switch. The safety pilot was no longer pointing toward the shore and his right hand was back on his right knee, his left hand was still not visible, and he still had both feet flat on the floor. The helicopter was at 625 ft msl and 109 knots groundspeed with 2° pitch nose up and about 7° right roll. At 10:57:42.00, the \"HORN\" caution light illuminated on the CWP (silenced condition), Nr indicated 290 rpm, FLI indicated about 1.25 FLI. The safety pilot began reaching with his right hand toward his cyclic control. The helicopter was 623 ft msl and 108 knots groundspeed with 3° pitch nose up and about 9° right roll.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo frames later (0.50 seconds, 10:57:42.50), the Nr gauge indicated 285 rpm, FLI indicated about 1.25 FLI. The pilot had moved his left hand back to his collective control. The collective control moved slightly toward the floor. The safety pilot now gripped his cyclic control with his right hand using a firm grip. The pilot was also manipulating his cyclic control. The helicopter was at 619 ft msl and 106 knots groundspeed with 3.6° pitch nose up and a value of about 11° right roll.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:43.50, the Nr gauge indicated 282 rpm, FLI indicated about 1.25. The safety pilot was still gripping his cyclic control with his right hand; his right foot was now on his right pedal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:43.75, the Nr gauge indicated 283 rpm, FLI indicated about 1.25 FLI. The HYD1 light illuminated on the CWP and then cleared 0.25 seconds later. The collective control had risen slightly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:44.75, the Nr Gauge indicated 259 rpm, FLI indicated about 1.75 FLI. Both the pilot and the safety pilot had their hands on their cyclic grips. The cyclic controls were moving forward and to the left, it was unclear who was performing cyclic control inputs. The safety pilot now had both feet on his pedals. The collective control was moved to a slightly lower position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:46.00, the Nr gauge indicated 259 rpm, FLI indicated about 1.75. Both pilots appeared to be manipulating their respective flight controls. The twist grip remained in the IDLE position. Loose objects in the cockpit showed an indication of a negative G force as they floated in the air.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:47.00, the Nr gauge indicated 254 rpm, FLI indicated about 1.50 FLI. The MGB P light (main gear box oil pressure warning light) illuminated on the CWP. Both pilots appeared to be manipulating the flight controls. The pilot looked down at his collective control then rotated the twist grip to the left from IDLE and back toward the FLIGHT detent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:47.50, the Nr gauge indicated 256 rpm, FLI indicated about 1.50 FLI. Both pilots appeared to be manipulating their respective flight controls. The twist grip was now back in the FLIGHT detent and the pilot was still looking down at the collective control. The twist grip warning light on the CWP had extinguished.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:47.75, the \"MGB P\" warning light extinguished from the CWP.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:48.50, the Nr gauge indicated 277 rpm, FLI indicated about 2 FLI. Both pilots appeared to be manipulating their respective flight controls. There appeared to be cyclic control inputs to the forward and left. The twist grip warning light illuminated again on the CWP and the twist grip was not in the FLIGHT detent. The collective control had risen slightly. The LIMIT light illuminated on the CWP.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:50.50, the Nr gauge indicated 270 rpm, FLI indicated about 2 FLI. Both pilots appeared to be manipulating the flight controls. The pilot looked back down toward the twist grip on the collective. There was forward and left cyclic input.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:51.00, in the next two frames (0.50 seconds), the collective raised slightly, the twist grip was momentarily rolled slightly toward FLIGHT.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:52.00, the Nr gauge indicated 254 rpm, FLI indicated about 2 FLI. An amber caution light illuminated but was not legible; the location of the caution light on the CWP was consistent with the \"DOOR\" caution light.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 10:57:53.50, in the final six frames, the helicopter impacted water. During the descent to impact, the collective control position was raised. The helicopter rolled to the right and pitched nose up. The images exhibited signatures of rolling shutter blurriness consistent with an impact. The ELT light illuminated. Both pilots had their hands and feet on their respective flight controls.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe recording ended. No further information was recovered.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 depicts a snapshot of a simulation created from the Vision 1000 data. The figure shows a representative helicopter and the flight track in yellow. The flight track descends toward the water where the recorded data ended.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 – Snapshot from Vision 1000 data simulation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFADEC and Engine Data Recorder (EDR)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FADEC on the Arriel 2D engine is a dual-module digital control unit that performs fuel regulation, engine parameters management, and engine data recording.

Engine parameters are recorded at a sample rate of 1 second in a continuous recording and at a sample rate of 20 ms on a limited duration when a failure occurs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe EDR is a recorder that exclusively records data sent by the FADEC, in the same manner, on a non-volatile memory component for maintenance purposes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FADEC and EDR were sent to the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis (BEA) for Civil Aviation Safety in France for examination and analysis. The data revealed that, during the flight and in the last 16 seconds of the recording, the twist grip was actuated from FLIGHT to IDLE to FLIGHT to IDLE and finally back to FLIGHT. The engine parameters varied accordingly to the FLIGHT or IDLE twist grip position with no anomalous indications noted. The FADEC recorded four failures at the very end of the recording that were associated with the helicopter impacting the water. - On September 28, 2018, at 1057 Alaska daylight time, an Airbus Helicopters AS350-B3e helicopter, N907PL, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident in Glacier Bay National Park, about 60 miles northwest of Gustavus, Alaska. The safety pilot was fatally injured, one passenger sustained serious injuries, and the pilot and another passenger remain missing and are presumed fatal. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the trip was to deliver the newly-purchased helicopter to Anchorage from the Airbus Helicopters factory in Texas. The left seat safety pilot was onboard for insurance coverage purposes and was acting as a safety pilot. The right seat pilot-in-command, who owned the helicopter, planned to drop off the safety pilot in Wasilla, Alaska, then proceed to Anchorage with the passengers. The trip began on September 25, 2018, and included more than 30 stops for sightseeing, fuel, and rest.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a postaccident interview, the surviving passenger, who was seated in the left rear seat, stated that the accident flight departed Juneau International Airport (JNU), Juneau, Alaska, and proceeded north toward Yakutat Airport (YAK), Yakutat, Alaska, at low altitude parallel to the shoreline. The passengers' headphones were muted, but at one point, the pilot unmuted the passengers' headphones and asked if the passengers wanted to land on a beach to stretch their legs. About 1 minute later, the safety pilot pointed his hand to the right toward a long stretch of beach. The passenger recalled that the pilot initiated a controlled right turn and the helicopter began to descend; the safety pilot did not have his hands on the flight controls. He stated that the pilot pulled up on the collective and rolled the throttle off. He never heard anything abnormal with the engine noise or noticed any anomalies with the helicopter. The pilot left the collective up and the helicopter entered a free fall from about 500 ft agl, then about 30 ft agl the pilot increased the throttle again. Before impact, he heard the pilot yell \"NO\" and continue to manipulate the flight controls. He felt the helicopter impact the water and noticed water splash in the cabin before he lost consciousness. He later awoke in the water and swam to shore, where he awaited rescue. He was unable to locate the other occupants.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the onboard cockpit image recorder, an Appareo Vision 1000, revealed that the helicopter was refueled at JNU before departing on the accident flight. The helicopter departed JNU and proceeded west over the mountains about 3,000 to 4,000 ft mean sea level (msl), then northwest along the coastline about 500 to 700 ft msl. Figure 1 depicts the helicopter's flight path from JNU to the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 – The helicopter flight track in orange from JNU to the accident site. - The Alaska State Medical Examiner's Office, Anchorage, Alaska, conducted an autopsy of the safety pilot. The autopsy report concluded that the cause of death was multiple blunt-force injuries. The autopsy revealed severe coronary artery disease with 75% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery. There was no thromboembolus and no evidence of a recent or past heart attack. There were no autopsy findings to suggest an incapacitating event; additionally, the recorded images from the Vision 1000 revealed that the safety pilot was conscious and functioning at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing of urine specimens by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory detected no drugs or ethanol.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's body was not recovered. - The National Weather Service (NWS) Alaska Aviation Weather Unit issued flying weather graphics, which forecast marginal visual flight rules and no low-level turbulence for the accident area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Aviation Weather Cameras for YAK and Cape Spencer, Alaska, revealed a broken to overcast cloud layer and clear visibility around the time of the accident flight. &#x0D;\nThe Appareo Vision 1000 onboard the helicopter showed brief periods of light rain on the helicopter's windscreen. The rain stopped about 7 minutes before the accident. - The pilot began his helicopter flight training in a Robinson R44 helicopter and had accumulated 59 hours of helicopter flight experience. On forms provided to Airbus before conducting AS350-B3e model transition training, the pilot reported no experience in the accident helicopter make and model. On June 4, 2018, the pilot completed transition training for the AS350-B3e with an Airbus Helicopters flight instructor at the Airbus factory in Grand Prairie, Texas; this training included 3 hours of flight time and 1 hour of simulator time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFrom June 18 to August 29, 2018, the pilot completed at least 10 flights (more than 18.3 hours) in an AS350-B2 model operated by the safety pilot's company in Alaska. in Alaska. Of the 18.3 hours, 11.4 were conducted with the accident safety pilot and 6.9 were conducted with a company flight instructor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn August 5, 2018, the pilot completed a 1.5-hour flight at the Airbus factory with the same Airbus Helicopters flight instructor in an AS350-B3e. The pilot had accumulated 4.5 flight hours in the B3e before departing Texas with the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe safety pilot was the owner, director of operations, and chief pilot for two different commercial helicopter operators in Alaska that operated several AS350-B2 model helicopters. &#x0D;\nThe surviving passenger was not a pilot, but he did attend helicopter ground school classes with the accident pilot and had knowledge of helicopter procedures and helicopter flight theory. The passenger stated that, when taking delivery of the accident helicopter in Texas, the safety pilot did not seem recently familiar with the B3e model and the options that were installed on the accident helicopter. The safety pilot asked a lot of questions about the B3e, and the pilot appeared more familiar with the helicopter systems than the safety pilot. - The main fuselage was found on a beach on its left side and partially embedded in the sand as shown in Figure 3. The structure forward of the aft cabin bulkhead had separated from the main fuselage. The left and right aft bench seats remained attached to the aft cabin bulkhead. The two longitudinal floor beams for the cabin floor structure were fractured several inches forward of the aft cabin bulkhead. The rear structure of the main fuselage was crushed inward throughout its circumference. The engine firewall remained attached to the main fuselage; its base was deformed in the aft direction and its upper portion was partially fractured. The engine deck was deformed downward. The engine air inlet barrier filter remained installed within its frame, but the cowling surrounding the frame had separated. Sand was found within the barrier filter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3 – Helicopter main wreckage partially embedded in the sand at low tide.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit floor, with the front seats attached, was recovered. The cockpit and cabin roof structure, about 5.5 ft in length measured from the upper windshield attachment, was also recovered. The Vision 1000 remained attached to the roof structure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe three main rotor blades were found separated from the rotor hub and were broken into large pieces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom, tail rotor assembly, and most of the instrument panel were not found.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel tank remained installed within the center fuselage and was removed at the accident site by the investigation team in support of the wreckage recovery. About 25 gallons of fuel was removed from the fuel tank at the site; additional fuel was removed after recovery of the fuel tank. Evidence of saltwater was observed in the fuel removed from the fuel tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll engine electrical, oil, fuel, and pneumatic connections were installed and intact. These connections were separated to facilitate removal of the engine from the airframe. One of the first stage compressor blades exhibited curling deformation in the direction opposite of normal rotation at its tip end.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot cyclic control was fractured from its lower attachment but remained with the wreckage via electrical wiring through its post. The grip remained attached to the pilot cyclic control. The safety pilot cyclic control and grip remained installed but exhibited deformation in multiple locations. Fractures were observed on multiple control tubes between the pilot and safety pilot cyclic controls to the mixing unit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot and safety pilot collective controls remained installed. The pilot collective head was present on the control stick but was partially separated and rotated to the right. The safety pilot collective head had separated and was missing from the control stick. The engine throttle twist grip was present on both the pilot and safety pilot collective controls and both twist grips were in the FLIGHT position. An attempt to manually rotate the twist grip was unsuccessful. Fractures were observed on multiple control tubes between the pilot and co- pilot collective controls to the mixing unit. All fractures exhibited signatures consistent with overload. The pilot and safety pilot pedals remained installed. The pilot pedals moved independently of each other and the interconnect linkages were fractured. The safety pilot pedal set remained interconnected. There were several impact-related separations leading up to the tail boom separation point. The tail rotor controls aft of the tail boom separation point were not recovered. The rotor brake and the emergency fuel shutoff handles remained installed on the roof and were in the stowed position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the turboshaft engine revealed that the linking tube that housed the power transmission shaft was dented on its underside where it normally contacts the engine rear mount saddle. The reduction gearbox was removed from the engine. The index mark on the splined nut (in the reduction gearbox) was slightly offset in the tightening direction. The offset was measured to be greater than 0 millimeter (mm) but less than 1 mm. The splined nut and its mating splines did not exhibit anomalous damage. The reduction gearbox geartrain exhibited continuity, but rotation was limited with evidence of binding. Sand was observed within the visible interior surfaces of the reduction gearbox. All free turbine blades were present and did not exhibit anomalous damage. Once separated from the engine, the free turbine spun freely when manually rotated. The free turbine nozzle guide vanes were removed, revealing the high pressure turbine. All high pressure turbine blades were present and did not exhibit anomalous damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe gas generator module could not be rotated by hand. Sand was observed within the gas generator module. The axial compressor and gas generator modules were subsequently removed, after which continuity of drive through the accessory gearbox was confirmed via manual rotation of the accessory gearbox input drive. The fuel filter was removed and the filter element was clean. Sand was observed in the fuel filter bowl along with residual fuel. The oil filter was removed and the filter element exhibited no evidence of debris. A residual liquid with the appearance of an oil and water mixture was observed within the oil filter bowl. The turbine inlet temperature thermocouples were removed and exhibited no evidence of melting. Removal of the engine's two magnetic chip detectors revealed evidence of sand. Removal of the engine's electronic chip detector revealed no evidence of debris. The bleed valve port and the auxiliary port were packed with sand.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine and airframe did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot, who did not hold a helicopter rating, was maneuvering his experimental amateur-built helicopter around the airport area. An acquaintance of the pilot stated that the accident pilot would regularly hover-taxi around the airport area testing the helicopter. The acquaintance also stated that, on the day of the accident, the pilot mentioned that the helicopter was flying well and that he did not have any issues with it. Afterward, the pilot started the helicopter and departed to the west and hover-taxied around the row of hangars back to his hangar. The acquaintance reported that he did not see the accident but that he heard the sound of the helicopter impacting a hangar.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of accident site showed that the helicopter's main rotor blades had collided with the top section of the hangar and that the helicopter came to rest oriented upward on an angle of about 30° and against the front of the hangar on a westerly heading. It is likely that, during the hover-taxi, the accident pilot ascended above a hover to the height of the hangars before colliding with one. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left anti-torque pedal for the pilot's right-seat position had failed where the horizontal and vertical tubes met. Notwithstanding the failed anti-torque pedal, examination of the airframe and engine found no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA metallurgical examination of the fractured horizontal and vertical components of the pilot's right seat's left anti-torque pedal assembly revealed that they failed from a lack of complete fusion at a fillet joint, which led to an overstress fracture. The fractured pedal tube assembly consisted of two aluminum tubes joined together with a filler metal that was consistent with a zinc solder alloy. However, the right anti-torque pedal tube assembly, which was intact, consisted of alloy steel tubes that were welded together with an alloy steel filler metal. The intact tube assembly had a much stronger quality due to the welding process and the inherent higher mechanical properties of the steel than those of the fractured tube assembly. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA build ledger for the helicopter revealed that the anti-torque pedals had been fabricated in December 1996 by the previous owner, almost 20 years before the accident pilot purchased the helicopter. However, the ledger did not detail the fabrication differences among the anti-torque pedals. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe investigation could not determine if the left anti-torque pedal for the right-seat position failed before the impact with the hangar or during the impact sequence. Although the pilot might have been able to control the helicopter after the pedal failed, that possibility would be unlikely given the pilot's minimal experience in helicopters.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The accident helicopter was constructed with an aluminum tail and a full fiberglass cockpit enclosure. The engine had a centrifugal compressor and a radial inflow turbine.&#x0D;\nThe most recent FAA certificate of registration for the helicopter was issued on June 28, 2015. In addition, the FAA issued a special airworthiness certificate on December 8, 2015, which authorized operation as an amateur-built helicopter in the experimental category.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident pilot purchased the helicopter in September 2015. A build ledger for the helicopter, which was found in the pilot's hangar, revealed that the anti-torque pedals had been fabricated in December 1996. - On September 12, 2018, about 1245 mountain daylight time, a RotorWay Exec 90 experimental amateur-built helicopter, N166LC, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident at Billings Logan International Airport (BIL), Billings, Montana. The nonrated rotorcraft-helicopter pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn acquaintance of the pilot, who occupied the hangar directly behind the accident pilot's hangar, reported that the pilot had purchased the helicopter about 3 years before the accident, but the acquaintance did not know the helicopter's condition or stage of assembly at that time. The acquaintance stated that the pilot hover-taxied the helicopter frequently on airport property to perform testing but that he \"had not really flown\" the helicopter. The acquaintance stated that, on the morning of the accident, the pilot hover-taxied around the airport area to perform testing, landed in front of his hangar, shut down the engine, and exited the helicopter. The acquaintance also stated that he and the pilot spoke for about 15 minutes, during which time the pilot told him how well the helicopter was flying and that he had no issues with it. Afterward, the pilot boarded the helicopter and started the engine. The pilot then hover-taxied the helicopter to the west and parallel to the row of hangars. The helicopter made a 90° left turn to the south and a 180° turn to the north, and the pilot then hover-taxied the helicopter north along the west end of the hangar row. The acquaintance stated that he did not witness the accident but heard the helicopter impact a hangar. - The Montana State Department of Justice Forensic Science Division, Missoula, Montana, performed an autopsy of the pilot. His cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory detected naproxen, an over-the-counter medication to reduce fever and to relieve mild pain; rosuvastain a prescription medication used to reduce blood cholesterol and triglycerides; doxylamine, an over-the-counter antihistamine medication to relieve symptoms caused by the common cold and allergies, and metoprolol for hypertension. No carbon monoxide and ethanol were detected. - A check of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records revealed that the pilot did not possess a rotorcraft-helicopter pilot certificate. No records were recovered regarding the pilot's flight time in rotorcraft-helicopter. - The helicopter's main rotor blades impacted the top of a 25-ft-tall hangar, and the fuselage then impacted the hangar's forward door section. The helicopter came to rest partially inside the hangar and facing upward on an angle of about 30° and against the front of the hangar on a magnetic heading of about 280°.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was a presence of fuel but no postcrash fire. The top and both sides of the cabin/cockpit were destroyed due to impact forces. All components necessary for flight were accounted for at the accident site. Flight control continuity was confirmed throughout the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth main rotor blades remained attached to their respective hubs at all attach points. The inboard 40 inches of one blade remained attached to its hub, and the outboard 100 inches of the blade was bent aft about 180°. The trailing edge of the other blade was separated and had opened starting about 15 inches from the hub; skin separation was observed to the top and bottom of the blade. The entire span of the blade exhibited areas that were bent, twisted, and deformed. Moderate leading-edge damage was observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe swashplate and scissors remained intact and undamaged. The lower engine mount was broken and deformed. All primary connections from both main rotor blades were intact and not compromised. Additionally, all connections from the swashplate to the main rotor hub were intact and not compromised.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor and gearbox assembly was intact at all connection points and undamaged. Both tail rotor blades remained intact and secure, with no damage observed to either blade. The tail rotor driveshaft remained intact and undamaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe transmission remained in place and was not compromised. The aft spine coupling&#x0D;\nwas separated from the engine coupling and undamaged. The transmission belt remained in place and was intact and tight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe vertical stabilizer was bent and twisted at its midspan. The stinger was not damaged. The tailboom was found on the ground directly behind the helicopter. The tailboom remained attached to the aft airframe but was almost entirely severed at the aft engine mount area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left and right skids had separated from the helicopter and were found about 18 ft from the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right horizontal stabilizer was bent slightly inboard, and the left stabilizer was bent, twisted, and deformed from its outboard to midsection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was intact and not compromised. It remained attached to the airframe at all attach points with no deformation observed. An on-site examination of the engine revealed no evidence of a catastrophic event before the accident. Further examination of the engine included an inspection of the fuel control unit, engine-driven fuel pump, all fuel lines, and the compressor inlet screen, which had no anomalies. The engine was disassembled to examine the internal components. The examination found some damage to the stationary power turbine vanes but no significant mechanical anomalies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cyclic and collective at both seat positions were not damaged. All connections were intact and not compromised.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe anti-torque pedals for the left-seat position and the right anti-torque pedal for the right-seat position were not damaged. The left anti-torque pedal for the right-seat position was found separated at the weld point of the vertical and horizontal tubes. The right seat separated vertical and horizontal pieces of the left anti-torque pedal, as well as the intact right anti-torque pedal, were examined by the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials Laboratory.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe results of the examination revealed that both anti-torque tube assemblies consisted of a parallel tube with flanges on both ends that was joined to a perpendicular tube at the midpoint. The flanged ends of the parallel tube from the fractured assembly were closed, whereas the ends of the intact assembly were open to the interior.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left tube assembly had fractured at the joint. The right tube assembly, which was intact, had a bolt and nut through one of the holes. Measurements of the two anti-torque tube assemblies were inconsistent with each other, as was the material used for their respective joining processes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe anti-torque tube assembly fractures were consistent with a fillet joint that exhibited a lack of complete fusion. These areas either had not bonded to the parallel tube surface or had disbonded.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHoles had been drilled in the perpendicular tubes; the holes were oriented parallel to the parallel tube direction. The perpendicular tube of the intact assembly contained three holes, whereas the corresponding tube of the fractured assembly included two holes. These two holes exhibited elongation and loss of material in the direction of the tube, consistent with wear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExcept for the right-seat left anti-torque pedal, no mechanical anomalies with the airframe or the engine were found that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The flight instructor was providing emergency procedure refresher training, as part of a contract between the US Army and a private contractor, to special operations pilots with the Jordanian Air Force. The accident was intended to be an introductory orientation flight for the pilot receiving instruction of the airports areas where the training would be occurring.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRadar data indicated that the helicopter traveled east from the departure airport and climbed to an altitude of about 500 ft above ground level (agl). Afterward, the helicopter began to descend, and flew at altitudes that varied between 0 and 120 ft agl at a groundspeed of about 90 knots. A witness saw the helicopter rapidly approaching his location and reported that the helicopter was flying low in a nose-down attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA short time later, the helicopter struck and severed a steel wire power distribution line, and continued to fly until the helicopter impacted the ground about 950 ft beyond the impact point with the line. Most of the severed power line was continuous to the main wreckage location, having likely trailed or been attached to the helicopter after impact. According to the radar data, and impact trajectory, the 36-ft-tall power line support poles would have been hidden from the pilots' view by a stand of trees as the helicopter approached the area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination revealed no anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. The wreckage location, which was well beyond the impact point with the power line, was consistent with the helicopter operating at a high forward speed and likely a high engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor was highly experienced in the accident helicopter make and model and had an extensive military career flying attack missions in helicopters. These missions included navigation and aerial gunnery, which would have required low-level flight close to terrain. Likewise, the pilot receiving instruction flew similar attack missions in helicopters with the Jordanian military. Therefore, it is likely that the flight instructor decided to intentionally deviate from the training syllabus and perform, or allow the pilot receiving instruction to perform, a high-speed, nap-of-the-earth flight for personal reasons, possibly to simulate their working environment, make the flight more interesting or engaging, push limits, or impress each other.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor had used the sedating antihistamine cetirizine at some time before the accident flight. Although the levels of the drug were well below the therapeutic range, it is not possible to determine if he could have been impaired by the sedating effects during the accident sequence.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The accident helicopter was one of two 369FF helicopters that Brunner Aerospace operated as part of the flight training program. Avionics equipment installed on the accident helicopter included a Garmin 430 GPS/Nav/Comm and a radar altimeter. The doors had been removed for training. No discrepancies were noted on any of the helicopter's flight logs between the last inspection and the accident. - On August 21, 2018, about 1218 central daylight time, a Hughes Helicopters 369FF, N530FU, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Granger, Texas. The flight instructor and the pilot receiving instruction sustained fatal injuries. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBrunner Aerospace had been contracted by the US Army Security Assistance Training Management Organization (SATMO), to provide \"MD530F Emergency Refresher Training (Enhanced)\" for special operations pilots who flew the MD-530F with the Jordanian Air Force. The accident flight was one such training flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight originated from Georgetown Municipal Airport (GTU), Georgetown, Texas, about 1208 and was destined for Draughon-Miller Central Texas Regional Airport (TPL), Temple, Texas. About 1207, the flight instructor made a radio call to the GTU tower and reported his intention to depart to the northeast. The tower controller acknowledged the flight instructor's transmission and cleared the helicopter for departure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe final stage of the accident was not observed by any witnesses; however radar data from a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air route surveillance radar about 30 miles northeast of GTU revealed a target departing the GTU airport environment about 1209 and traveling east while climbing to a mode C transponder-reported altitude of 1,100 ft (about 500 ft above ground level [agl]). About that time, the instructor requested a frequency change with the tower, and 4 minutes after departure (9 miles east of Georgetown), the target began to descend. One minute later, the target had reached an altitude of about 50 ft agl. The target continued traveling east at a groundspeed of about 90 knots and at altitudes that varied between 0 and 120 ft agl over unpopulated areas.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was at his residence 2 miles southwest of the town of Granger, stated that although helicopters are a normal sight in the area, between 1200 and 1300 on the day of the accident his attention was drawn to the unusually loud sound of a helicopter. When the witness looked north, he observed a black helicopter rapidly approach his house from the northwest, flying low over a field, about 30 to 40 ft agl, in a nose-down attitude. The witness became concerned that the helicopter might collide with his house, and reported that just as the helicopter approached to within about 200 ft, it began to rapidly climb up and over the power lines that bordered his street. He then looked to the south and anticipated that he would see the helicopter, but it was out of his view behind a stand of trees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe radar data revealed that, about 1215:26, the target, while at 25 ft agl, had traveled left to right directly in front of the witness's house, coming within 700 ft. The target then began to climb and reached 125 ft agl as it passed beyond the witness' house while proceeding southeast. The last recorded target, which was 1 mile west of the accident site, was captured at 1217:14 at an altitude of 58 ft agl. The helicopter wreckage was located in a cotton field about 4 miles east of the witness' residence, and 1.5 miles west of Granger Lake. (as shown in figure 1).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Radar track (as indicated by red line) and wreckage location. (Background image courtesy of Google Earth).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA student pilot and a flight instructor in a fixed-wing airplane who were returning to GTU reported that, between 1215 and 1220, they both heard a series of expletives being transmitted over the GTU frequency in a manner that, according to the instructor, sounded \"desperate.\" The student pilot stated that the transmissions lasted about 2 seconds, and the flight instructor stated that the transmissions happened just before he made his first call to GTU tower. The student pilot stated that he and the flight instructor were flying over Granger Lake (1.5 miles from the accident site) at the time. No such transmissions were heard on the GTU tower audio recordings. - Instructor&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Tarrant County, Texas, performed an autopsy on the flight instructor. The cause of death was thermal trauma, and no significant natural disease was identified.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory for the flight instructor detected tamsulosin, celecoxib, and cetirizine (0.043 µg/ml) in the pilot's specimens. Tamsulosin is used to treat an enlarged prostate, and celecoxib is a prescription anti-inflammatory medication. Neither is considered to be impairing. Cetirizine is an over-the-counter sedating antihistamine intended to treat allergy symptoms. The usual therapeutic range is 0.190 to 1.450 µg/ml. Although this drug can undergo postmortem redistribution, that would likely mean that the antemortem level was lower than the tested level. No carbon monoxide or ethanol was detected.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cause of death for the pilot receiving instruction was thermal trauma, and toxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified no carbon monoxide, ethanol, or for screened drugs. - According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the altitude of the sun when viewed from the accident site at 1218 would have been 64.6°, with an azimuth (east of north) of 133°. - As part of the SATMO contract, Brunner Aerospace provided helicopters, flight instruction, and training materials along with the weapons and ammunition required to complete the live weapons portion of the training. The SATMO contract training program was managed by the accident flight instructor and the Brunner Aerospace chief operating officer (COO), both of whom also provided the flight and ground training.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe syllabus, which was created by Brunner Aerospace and approved by the Department of Defense, comprised both ground and flight training. According to the COO, the most current syllabus was co-managed by the accident flight instructor and based on the US Army 160th SOAR Flight Training Guide. The operational areas documented in the syllabus included the immediate airspace surrounding TPL, GTU, and Taylor (T74) airports, along with a target practice range about 50 miles east of Georgetown, near the town of Cameron.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFive pilots were trained at a time during a 14-day period, for a total of 25 pilots per year. This was the fourth year Brunner Aerospace had been providing the service.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe contract required the training to include standard flight emergency procedures, such as autorotations, run-on landings, and simulated system failures, along with live weapon target practice directly from the cockpit (which was usually performed on the last day of training).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll training was performed either within the airport environment or over the designated firing range. The syllabus did not make specific recommendations or have prohibitions regarding transition altitudes between airports; the COO stated that transition altitudes between airports typically ranged between 200 and 500 ft agl at speeds of up to 90 knots. The COO further stated that no formal transition routes had been established between airports because the syllabus did not call for any low-level flight outside of the runway or target practice environment. The COO stated that while he often flew low-level hog eradication flights (unrelated to the SATMO contract), and had experience with the local low-level terrain features, the accident pilot, who lived in Alabama, did not have such local familiarity.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe COO stated that some of the Jordanian pilots often wanted to fly low-level, high-speed maneuvers outside of the airport environment. He assumed that this was based on their day-to-day flying routine, which included low and fast training and combat missions. The COO considered flying low-level, nap-of-the-earth, \"gun runs\", or similar operations during training to be serious transgressions, and he stated that he was not aware of the accident pilot being involved in such transgressions while with Brunner Aerospace.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident, which occurred on the second day of the training course, was intended to be a local orientation flight lasting 1.1 hours. Although the orientation flight usually took place on the first sortie of training with each pilot, due to inclement weather and a miscommunication with the Jordanian team,  the flights on the first day were delayed, and the decision was made to perform the orientation flight on sortie two on the second day. The first training flight for the pilot receiving instruction was on the morning of the accident between 0730 and 0915. The training flight consisted primarily of autorotation practice at TPL and was conducted with the accident instructor and in the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNeither the SATMO contract nor the Brunner Aerospace syllabus included any provisions or training requirements for low-level, nap-of-the-earth flights. The COO stated that he was not aware of the accident pilot being involved in such operations during instructional flights while with the company. - Flight Instructor&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor had held operational and instructional pilot positions within multiple US Army regiments, including time as an attack helicopter pilot with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR). During that time, his flight duties included long-range navigation and precision aerial gunnery in the AH-6J \"Little Bird\" attack helicopter, which had a similar design as the accident helicopter and was based on Boeing's MH-6 \"Little Bird\" and MD Helicopters' 369-series helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter retirement from the US Army and before his employment with Brunner Aerospace, the flight instructor held positions as a pilot, an instructor, and a manager at various aviation-related companies operating in Iraq and Afghanistan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor was in his second year working for Brunner Aerospace as an instructor. He resided in Alabama and stayed in a hotel in Texas while he provided training.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot Receiving Instruction&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot receiving instruction was a first lieutenant in the Jordanian Air Force Special Operations Command, for which he flew an MD530F helicopter that was designed and configured similarly to the accident helicopter. Brunner Aerospace indicated that the Jordanian pilots attend the training course each year and that the accident flight occurred during the pilot's  second year attending the training. - The first identified points of ground contact consisted of five matching 2-ft-long excavations that were equally spaced throughout a length of about 40 ft and were on a magnetic heading of 100°. The excavations contained fragments of yellow paint, which matched the paint color on the tips of the five main rotor blades. The cotton plants adjacent to the excavations had been sheared on a 45° plane relative to the ground. The debris field, which consisted of landing skid fragments, pieces of windscreen, cabin contents, and sections of a main rotor blade, continued for 100 ft on a heading of 080° directly to the main cabin.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cabin came to rest on its left side on a heading of about 280°. Most of the cabin was consumed by fire. The tailcone and tail rotor assembly had separated and were located about 20 ft east of the cabin.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe debris field was bordered to the west by a series of 36-ft-tall power distribution poles, which were oriented north-south and spaced about 450 ft apart. The tops of the poles were spanned by an overhead power line made of steel stranded wire, and an \"underbuild\" line 4 ft below. The overhead line in the northwest corner of the field, which was about 950 ft from the main wreckage, was severed about midspan (as shown in figure 2), and a red belly-mounted strobe light lens was located 100 ft to the east. The severed point of the line was located in between two stands of trees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Wreckage and power line locations. (Background image source: Texas Department of Public Safety.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe other end of the overhead line, which was about 1,300 ft in length, had been pulled away from the three poles to the south and was continuous to the main wreckage (as shown in figure 3). The poles exhibited recent ground disruption at their bases and were bent toward the main wreckage site. When facing east at the altitude and direction of travel of the radar targets, the two poles that held the severed line were obscured by trees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Detached power line leading to wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the helicopter was painted black with silver lettering, layers of red paint were observed under the paint of various skin and fairing components, indicating that the helicopter was previously painted red. Red-colored transfer marks were observed on the 75-ft-long section of the southern portion of the overhead line that led from the separation point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no evidence of a bird strike to any of the airframe structure, and no bird remnants were found on the ground in the area between the final radar target and the severed power line.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe showed evidence of stranded wire contact to both of the forward and the left rear landing gear struts and one of the main rotor blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll main and tail rotor blades were located near the main wreckage. Four of the five main rotor blades remained attached to the hub assembly; all blades exhibited spiral and aft curl damage with chordwise abrasion and damage to their leading edge surfaces. The tailrotor drive shaft exhibited rotational signatures at the point where the tail rotor assembly had separated from the tailboom. Similar rotational signatures and damage were observed at multiple locations throughout the drivetrain of the main transmission.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll engine ancillary lines were intact at their respective fittings. The engine was disassembled, and N1 and N2 drive continuity was established with no evidence of internal thermal damage or failure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDrive train continuity throughout the gearbox was confirmed, and all gears were intact and remained coated in oil with no evidence of catastrophic failure. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "On the morning of the accident, the pilot flew the helicopter cross-country to attend a meeting at another airport. He departed on the return flight to his home airport later that afternoon and climbed the helicopter to an altitude of about 1,700 ft, leveled off, and the groundspeed increased. About 3 minutes after takeoff, the helicopter entered a right descending turn that continued until it impacted a condominium building at a high vertical speed. Witnesses reported that the helicopter rocked \"back and forth unsteadily\" before it suddenly pitched downward to impact the roof of the building.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The engine crankshaft gear bolt was found unthreaded and the alignment pin for the crankshaft gear was found sheared. The locking tab designed to prevent rotation of the bolt was found attached and intact. Examination of the bolt, locking tab, and accessory gears revealed no pre-impact damage. Had the bolt unthreaded during flight, the engine would have stopped running; however, the engine oil coolers exhibited grinding damage consistent with the engine rotating at the time of impact, and witnesses reported hearing the engine running continuously until the impact. It is therefore likely that the bolt unthreaded during the accident sequence. The forward-facing accessory case cover was found impact damaged and partially missing. Had the accessory gear train stopped rotating due to impact or from fragments of the cover or debris in the gear mesh, the crankshaft could continue to rotate briefly, allowing the bolt to unthread without damaging the locking tab.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 85-year-old pilot was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease about 3 years before the accident. He experienced tremors in both hands, which was treated with medication and surgery with some success. The tremors consistently affected his left hand more than the right, and he reported that the tremors were more pronounced later in the day. Although the severity of his tremors or to what degree they may have affected his ability to fly the helicopter could not be determined, it is possible that they may have had more of an effect during the accident flight than on the day's earlier flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the 2 years preceding the accident, the pilot's doctors noted mild dementia and mild cognitive impairment. His dementia was treated with medication (which he subsequently discontinued), and reportedly improved, although his mild cognitive impairment persisted. His doctors also noted that the pilot had impaired measures of simple attention and visual scanning and tracking speed, and mild, relative difficulty with sustained attention. They recommended that the pilot not fly due to concerns with his attention, reaction time, and judgment.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt is likely that impairment resulted from one or more of the pilot's well-documented progressive impaired cognitive and physical abilities negatively affected his ability to safely operate the helicopter and led to the loss of control.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The most recent recorded maintenance was an oil change performed on January 26, 2018, at an airframe and engine total time of 649 hours, and 35 hours since engine overhaul. The airframe total time at the time of the accident could not be determined. - On July 8, 2018, about 1633 eastern daylight time, a Robinson R44-II, N616HS, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident in Williamsburg, Virginia. The pilot and one person on the ground were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had flown from Stafford Regional Airport (RMN), Stafford, Virginia, to Williamsburg Jamestown Airport (JGG), Williamsburg, Virginia, earlier that morning to attend a meeting at JGG. Airport personnel reported that the helicopter had been refueled to capacity before the pilot departed on the return flight to RMN.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutomatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data showed that the helicopter departed JGG about 1630, then turned north. The helicopter climbed to a pressure altitude about 1,700 ft. After reaching 1,700 ft, the helicopter leveled off and the groundspeed increased from about 60 knots to about 110 knots over the next 1.5 minutes. The helicopter then entered a right, decreasing-radius, turning descent that continued until tracking coverage was lost. At the last recorded position, the helicopter was in the vicinity of the accident site, descending at a rate greater than 10,000 ft per minute.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses near the accident site described the helicopter as flying low; one estimated its height about 100 ft above the ground as it approached a two-story condominium complex. They described it as flying relatively straight and level, or slightly descending, before suddenly pitching nose down and descending into the roof of the building. One witness described the helicopter as \"rocking back and forth unsteadily\" just before it pitched downward. Another witness, located about 300 ft south of accident site, recalled the engine making a \"constant sound\" as it flew over his head.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted a condominium building located about 3 nautical miles north of JGG. - An autopsy of the pilot was performed by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Central District of Virginia. The pilot's cause of death was blunt force trauma.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed on the pilot by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified 0.032 grams per deciliter (gm/dL) of ethanol in kidney tissue and no drugs or ethanol in muscle. The finding of ethanol in kidney tissue but not muscle is consistent with postmortem production.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 85-year-old pilot had a long history of progressive upper extremity tremor that he had reported to the FAA. According to personal medical records, the pilot had been diagnosed with a parkinsonian syndrome in April 2015. Treatment with medication resulted in some improvement of his symptoms. He subsequently had a deep brain stimulator (DBS) implanted that improved his right-hand tremor. Neuropsychological evaluations performed pre- (September 2015) and post- (August 2016) surgery determined increased cognitive decline to mild cortical dementia; cognitive decline can be a side-effect of the surgery. After the surgery, the pilot reported that his right-hand tremors had improved, but worsened later in the day, attributed to fatigue. The neuropsychological testing in August 2016 determined that the pilot was not insightful about his cognitive issues and that he had worsening of psychomotor speed and attention. In a letter written to the FAA in September 2016, the pilot's neurologist recommended that he not fly due to his dementia. The pilot was started on medication to treat the dementia. The pilot began seeing a new neurologist in June of 2017 when he informed the neurologist of his desire to return to flight status and he complained of tremors and memory difficulties. The second neurologist concurred that the pilot should not fly and should only drive short distances because he was concerned about the pilot's reaction time and judgment. The neurologist ordered physical therapy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn an August 2017 visit to the neurologist, the pilot reported having had six motor vehicle accidents through the spring of that year, and was having constant daily left hand tremors and imbalance. Left hand resting tremors, which were greater than the right hand, were noted. A follow-up evaluation found improvement from previous testing with evidence of mild cognitive impairment instead of dementia. Also noted was that the pilot had impaired measures of simple attention and visual scanning and tracking speed and mild, relative difficulty with sustained attention. The pilot reported self-discontinuing his medication for dementia in September 2017 because of a letter from the FAA that stated, \"that as long as he used the patch, he would not be able to receive a flying license.\" At numerous physician office visits, the pilot had reported difficulty with tremors, balance, and memory. A driver rehab evaluation performed in October 2017 noted below-normal dynamic vision and vision information processing. The pilot demonstrated deficits in both sustained and divided attention. A driving restriction of \"drive within a 15-mile radius from home\" was recommended. Subsequently, at the pilot's neurologist visit on October 31, 2018, the pilot reported failing his department of motor vehicle (DMV) driver's test and mentioned that he was going to try a different DMV office to get his driver's license reinstated. At the January 19, 2018, visit, the pilot told the neurologist that his driver's license had been reissued. The last office visit to the neurologist prior to the accident was on May 4, 2018. The pilot reported his disappointment with the April 2018 FAA denial to issue his medical certificate. He stated he had had an appointment with the neurosurgeon in the next 6 months to a year to replace his DBS battery. The pilot reported continued bilateral hand tremors with mild imbalance. On a physical exam, slowed movements, decreased eyeblinks, a mild wide-based gait, and left greater than right hand resting tremors were noted. - According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airman records, the pilot did not possess a valid medical certificate at the time of the accident. His application for a medical certificate in 2016 was deferred to the FAA for evaluation of his recent surgical interventions for tremors related to Parkinson's disease. As recently as April 2018, the FAA denied issuing a medical certificate due to the pilot's cognitive impairment and Parkinson's disease.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe last entry in the pilot's logbook was a round-trip flight from RMN to JGG in December 2017. Although not logged as such, that flight was with an instructor, according to a witness statement. During doctor visits in 2017 and 2018, he reported that his last flight was on August 1, 2016. - The main wreckage came to rest inside the north end of the building, with some components, including a section of the tail rotor drive shaft, found along the 70-ft wreckage path extending from the building on a heading of about 20° magnetic. All the major components of the helicopter were present at the accident site except for the tail boom. The vertical stabilizer, aft bulkhead, and a section of the tail rotor guard were located; however, building damage prevented access to several areas surrounding the main wreckage. Many of the components were partially or completely consumed by a post-crash fire. Remnants of the removable copilot side controls were found near their stowed position. Remnants of all pilot side controls were present. All hydraulic controls were identified, with portions of all push-pull rods extending from the hydraulic actuators. Portions of the flight control rods were thermally damaged. All main and tail rotor flight control rod ends were secure to their attachment points at both ends, except for the tail rotor gear box connection, which was not recovered. The transmission input sheave (pulley) was manually rotated in both the locking and freewheeling modes, and the main rotor drive shaft rotated with the sheave, with some interference from a damaged flex coupling. A score mark on the aft face of the upper sheave was about 4 inches long in the direction of rotation. The leading edges of both main rotor blades were dented and bent in several locations and remained attached to the rotor hub. Most of the remainder of the main rotor blades were consumed by fire. The tail rotor gearbox mounting bolts were fractured consistent with overload. The transmission continuity was confirmed from the upper sheave to the main rotor mast and to the intermediate flex coupling. The main and auxiliary fuel tanks were severely damaged. The main tank cap was in place; the auxiliary tank cap was missing. Portions of the main and auxiliary fuel tanks were consumed by post-crash fire. The tail rotor gearbox, remnants of tail rotor blades, and remnants of the main rotor tips were found near the location of the main wreckage during a subsequent search of the accident site in October 2018.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine crankshaft rotated freely by hand. The crankshaft gear index pin was sheared, and the gear bolt was found mostly unthreaded. The locking tab on the bolt head was found in place against the bolt head. After securing the gear in place, valvetrain and continuity from the engine crankshaft to the accessory section was confirmed. A subsequent examination of the crankshaft gear bolt, locking tab, and accessory gears in the NTSB Materials Laboratory revealed no preimpact damage or anomalies. The engine accessory case cover, which covers the crankshaft gear and accessory gears, was impact damaged and partially missing. The engine was oriented in the helicopter with the accessory case facing forward. Both oil coolers, one on each side of the engine, exhibited grinding damage in line with the starter ring gear. Thumb compression and suction were present on all cylinders, though weaker on cylinder No. 5. The cylinder head and intake pipe for cylinder No. 5 displayed impact damage, and debris was found in the intake. All spark plugs exhibited normal wear and coloration when compared to the Champion check-a-plug chart; the Nos. 4 and 6 bottom spark plugs were oil-soaked. Both magnetos were impact and fire damaged and could not be functionally tested. Borescope inspection of all cylinders revealed no damage or scoring marks on piston tops, cylinder walls, or valves. The fuel injection servo inlet screen was free of debris. The butterfly valve was found in the full-open position; however, the input control rod was damaged and not connected. Impact damage to the mixture control actuator precluded determination of its position. The mixture control knob in the cockpit was found in the full-rich position. All six fuel injector nozzles were found unobstructed. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial helicopter pilot was conducting aerial applications work on a corn field. The helicopter did not return to the loading platform when expected, and a subsequent search for the helicopter ensued. The wreckage of the helicopter was located near the south edge of a field being sprayed. The upper transmission, mast, and main rotor separated from the helicopter and were located about 75 ft north of the main wreckage. Ground scars, damage to the crop, and damage to the helicopter was consistent with an inflight separation of the upper transmission, mast, and main rotor. A postimpact fire ensued and damaged the cabin and engine of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the lower transmission housing found elongation of four of the bolt holes and tearing of two of the bolt holes; two of the bolt holes were unremarkable. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe upper main rotor transmission housing pieces and gears separated from the lower transmission housing due to shear fractures of the threads in six of the eight bolts attaching the housing pieces. The fractures likely occurred due to the fracture of threads on the two bolts that were weakened by thread damage from a prior installation using those bolts as discussed below. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSpecifically, these bolts showed damage on intact threads adjacent to the sheared threads. The damage had circumferential markings and a profile matching the nut threads with deformation to the remaining thread, consistent with an over-torque installation of a nut on the bolt. However, because the nuts likely did not back off from their installed position, the thread damage would have occurred during a prior installation. Thus, these two bolts were likely installed on the accident helicopter with damaged threads that were not detected at the time of installation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, one of the bolts had thread profile anomalies indicating that the bolt was likely manufactured with an incompletely formed thread. The deviations from the standard thread profile could have contributed to an improper fit with the installed nut and might have contributed to the thread damage on that bolt during a prior installation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor the other six bolts, the fit between the nut and the bolt might have contributed to threads shearing. The major diameter of threads on one of these six bolts was below minimum specification, which would limit the thread engagement to produce a shear fracture of the thread, and the major diameter of another of these bolts was close to the lower limit. No evidence of prior thread damage was observed on either of these bolts, indicating the failures were likely secondary to the failure of bolts Nos. 2 and 3.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe housing assembly attachments showed evidence of poor maintenance practice. Deviations from the assembly drawing included the use of bolts with an incorrect number of washers and incorrect length. Furthermore, the damage to bolts 2 and 3 from a prior installation was not detected when the bolts were installed on the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLimited maintenance records were available for the helicopter. According to the available records, the main rotor transmission was replaced in 2009, and the transmission bolts were retorqued in 2014, about 73.6 flight hours before the accident. The investigation was unable to determine if any other maintenance was conducted on the transmission fasteners, when the maintenance was performed that initially damaged the threads of the two of the bolts, or when the damaged bolts were installed on the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo other mechanical anomalies were noted that would have precluded normal operation. The inflight separation of the upper transmission was due to the weakened bolt threads as a result of damage during a prior installation which caused the threads on those bolts as well as the threads on other bolts to fracture. However, the prior installation damage could not be associated to any particular maintenance action.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Limited maintenance records were provided to FAA inspectors and subsequently, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators. A review of the available maintenance records indicated that an annual inspection had been completed on February 15, 2018, at an airframe total time of 13,922 hours. The Hobbs Meter on scene read 323.8. The helicopter flew approximately 26.8 hours between the last inspection and the accident and had a total airframe time of 13,948.8 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 9, 2009, the main rotor transmission was replaced with another transmission. A maintenance release card for the main rotor transmission, dated June 24, 2009, revealed that the fan drive quill and the clutch assembly were repaired with serviceable parts in accordance with Bell 47G-2 maintenance procedures. The transmission was tested and reinstalled \"in accordance with the manufacturers publications and FAR part 43.\" The work orders associated with this replacement confirmed this information.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe maintenance records contained only two entries indicating routine annual/100-hour inspections between July 2009 and January 2014.  A maintenance log entry dated November 1, 2014, stated in part \"retorqued transmission T adapter plat bolts.\" This maintenance was performed during a 100-hour inspection at an airframe total time of 13,875.2 hours. The mechanic that performed this work was no longer available to speak to investigators. No other entries in the available maintenance records noted work on the main rotor transmission.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the co-owner of the helicopter, on the day before the accident, he and the pilot performed general maintenance on the helicopter. The co-owner's description of the maintenance performed did not include any reference to work on the main rotor transmission.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Illustrated Parts Breakdown (IPB) document for the Bell 47G-2 helicopter as provided by a representative of Scott's Bell, Inc., the attachment bolts holding pieces of the main rotor transmission housing together consist of 6 AN5-37A bolts, 1 AN5-41A bolt, and 1 AN5-44A bolt. The AN5-41A and AN5-44A bolts are located next to each other. Each of the bolts in the IPB has a NAS679A5 nut. The 6 AN5-37A bolts are each installed with 1 AN960-516 washer under the head and 1 AN960-516L washer under the nut. The AN5-41A and AN5-44A bolts are each installed with 1 AN960-516 washer under the head and another AN960-516 washer under the nut. - On July 6, 2018, about 1720 eastern daylight time, a Bell 47G-2 helicopter, N96195, was substantially damaged when it impacted a corn field near Arlington, Indiana. A postimpact fire ensued. The commercial pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was owned and operated by Central Indiana Ag Services, LLC as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 aerial application flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight plan had been filed for the flight. The local flight departed about 1655 from a loading platform at a farm located 1 mile northwest of the accident location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the co-owner of the helicopter, the pilot had been flying since 0945 that morning and had completed between 10 and 15 spray runs. The pilot was applying a fungicide to corn crops and each run was averaging 20 minutes. When the pilot did not return after 30 minutes, they initiated search operations. The wreckage was located later that evening.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 shows the flight track for the accident flight based on GPS latitude and longitude data recovered from a Lowrance AIRMAP 2000c device installed on the helicopter. The device contained data from three flight tracks; one of which was the accident flight. The data did not contain altitude or time data, so the time lengths of the track are not known. The last data point of the final flight recorded was consistent with the wreckage location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no witnesses to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Accident Flight Track from Lowrance Airmap - The Central Indiana Forensic Associates, LLC, performed the autopsy on the pilot on December 12, 2008, as requested by the Shelby County Coroner's Office. The cause of death was \"positional asphyxia and left-sided rib fractures\" and the manner of death was ruled an accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological tests on specimens that were collected during the autopsy. Results were negative for all tests conducted. - A performance study was conducted by the NTSB Office of Research and Engineering using the data recovered from the two onboard recording devices to understand the pilot's flying technique on previous flights. During the five flights, the helicopter stayed between 100 and 150 ft above ground level and the groundspeeds varied between 40 and 60 knots. The calculated load factors for these flights varied from about 1.20 g's to 1.45 g's, which were within the normal flight load factors of between 2 and 2.5 g's for most helicopters. - The wreckage was located at the south end of a corn field at an elevation of 850 ft. The initial impact point was characterized by damage to the crop, just north of the edge of the field. The initial damage swath/scar was 20 ft long and 6 ft at its widest point. The helicopter impacted on an approximate bearing of 002° and the wreckage came to rest inverted about 20 ft from the initial impact point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage of the helicopter included the fuselage, landing skids, engine and lower transmission assembly, tail rotor, and tail boom. A postimpact fire damaged the left side of the fuselage and engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe upper portion of the helicopter, to include both main rotor blades, the mast, collective and cyclic controls, swash plate, and upper portion of the transmission were located about 75 ft north of the main wreckage. The components remained together as an assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lower portion of the transmission assembly remained attached to the engine. The internal gears of the transmission rotated freely when actuated at the engine and the tail rotor spline. A large scar/witness mark was observed on the inside well of the transmission. The mounting holes on the lower housing of the transmission were labeled Nos. 1 through 8 for identification purposes (Figure 2). The Nos. 1 and 7 holes were torn and partially separated. The Nos. 2 and 3 holes were unremarkable. The Nos. 4 and 5 holes were elongated. The Nos. 6 and 8 holes were elongated, and the hole material exhibited tearing on the outer edge. No fasteners remained in any of the holes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Lower Transmission With Labels 1 through 8&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe upper portion of the transmission assembly remained attached to the main rotor assembly. The attachment locations where the upper portion separated from the lower portion were labeled Nos. 1 through 8 for identification purposes and corresponded with the lower portion of the transmission. Bolt Nos. 1 and 7 remained inserted and both the metal from the adjacent mounting surface and the nut remained attached. Bolts Nos. 2 and 3 remained inserted and neither bolt remained attached to a nut. Bolts Nos. 4, 5, and 6 remained partially inserted and neither bolt remained attached to a nut. Bolt No. 8 remained inserted and was bent at the thread end and no nut was attached.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe upper portion of the main rotor transmission assembly and the eight attachment bolts were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC, for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA washer was observed under the head of each of the attachment bolts Nos. 1, 2, 7, and 8. A washer was also included with attachment bolt No. 4, but not with bolt Nos. 3 and 5. Bolts Nos. 1 and 7 had nuts remaining in place on the threaded end of the bolt, and 2 washers were observed under the nut on each bolt. The thickness of all remaining washers except for the one under the head of attachment bolt No. 7 was approximately 0.060 inch, consistent with an AN960-516 washer. The washer under the head of attachment bolt No. 7 was about one-half the thickness of the other washers, consistent with an AN960-516L washer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the lower surface of the freewheeling gear where it mated to the lower transmission housing, areas of slight fretting damage and material transfer were observed near attachment bolt holes Nos. 3 through 8. The lower edge of attachment bolt hole No. 5 was deformed inward consistent with contact with the attachment bolt grip.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe attachment bolts had varying numbers of intact and sheared threads. On bolts Nos. 1 and 7, all threads were intact. Bolts Nos. 2 through 6 and 8 had between one and five intact threads adjacent to the bolt grip, but the thread peaks were at least partially flattened and smeared, consistent with contact with the corresponding lower housing attachment hole bore. The remainder of the threads in bolts Nos. 2 through 6 and 8 were fractured near the thread roots, and the fracture surfaces were smeared, consistent with shear fracture from contact with the corresponding threads of the nut. Sheared bolt threads remained trapped within the separated nut.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCloser views of the threaded ends of bolts Nos. 2 and 3 illustrated intact but damaged threads between the shank and the completely sheared threads. The pressure flanks of some of the mostly intact threads were deformed and missing with a profile shape corresponding to the nut thread peak profile. Circumferential sliding contact marks were observed in the contact surfaces of the damaged pressure flanks where the deformed and missing bolt thread was observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pressure flanks on several intact threads on bolt No. 5 had circumferential contact marks but appeared without substantial deformation or missing material. The pressure flanks of the intact threads on bolt No. 4 had no circumferential contact marks or circumferential contact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDimensional measurements on the intact portions of threads for attachment bolts Nos. 2 through 5 found that the major diameters of threads in bolts Nos. 2, 3, and 5 were less than the minimum specified diameter for a new bolt and the major diameter of the threads for bolt No.  4 was close to the lower limit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBolts Nos. 3 through 5 had thread profile measurements that were generally comparable to the thread specification.  Measured values for bolt No. 2 showed larger deviations from the specified thread profile. The average flank angle for bolt No. 2 was about 11° less than the specified angle of 60° and the average thread depth for bolt No. 2 was 0.0055 inch less than the specified value of 0.02481 inch. The average width of the thread peaks in bolt No. 2 was about double the maximum thread peak width calculated from the thread form at the minimum major diameter of 0.3053 inch. The thread peaks for bolt No. 2 had a gold hue consistent with the original plating, indicating variations in thread depth and peak width were not due to wear or damage to the thread peak. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was employed by a US company that leased the helicopter and the pilot's services to a Taiwanese fishing ship. The pilot and the turbine-powered, float-equipped helicopter were stationed on the ship, and a Taiwanese observer provided fish-spotting services. No helicopter maintenance personnel were stationed on the ship. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMost of the brief flight was captured by a shipboard surveillance camera. The camera faced forward, with a field of view that included the helicopter on the landing platform, as well as the ocean surface forward of and on both sides of the ship. The ocean surface appeared glassy, with only slight swells and no waves. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the visual aspects of glassy water make it difficult to judge an aircraft's height above the water, and the smooth, reflecting surface can lead to confusion.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter lifted off and immediately entered a right descending turn, flying out of view on the right side of the image. Several seconds later, the helicopter re-entered the field of view via the upper right image frame. The helicopter was traveling nearly horizontal from right to left at an altitude that was sufficiently low for visible ripples to form on the water surface behind the helicopter. The helicopter struck the water, overturned, and remained afloat inverted. Skiff boats responded to the accident location within minutes, and both helicopter occupants, who were still strapped into their seats, were recovered but unable to be resuscitated &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMost of the helicopter, absent the tail boom and several main rotor blades, was recovered from the water, transported to shore, and examined two months later.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSubsequent recovery and examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of any mechanical anomalies that would have prevented continued flight above the water surface. Main rotor blade damage signatures indicated that the engine was providing significant power at the time of water impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo days before the accident, the helicopter, which had been parked outside on the ship's landing platform, was exposed to a significant storm. Afterward, the pilot initially had some difficulty starting the engine because it had too much water in it. These difficulties, which included the expulsion of oil and smoke from the engine during the start attempts were resolved, and the pilot conducted a subsequent flight (before the accident flight) that lasted 1.5 hours. The oil and smoke were likely the result of a stuck check valve in the engine oil system, which would not have affected engine operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's toxicology results indicated the presence of a sedating antihistamine that can reduce reaction time. The pilot's impairment, if any, from this medication could not be determined given the detected level of medication. However, it is possible that the medication affected the pilot's reaction time, which was especially critical given that the glassy, nearly featureless ocean surface could have hampered the pilot's ability to visually determine the helicopter's height above the water surface. This ocean surface condition, either alone or along with a decreased reaction time, could have compromised the pilot's ability to recognize and correct the helicopter's descent toward the water.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Pilot Text Messages&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the day before and/or of the accident, the pilot exchanged several text messages with his wife. In the text messages, the pilot noted that the helicopter (which was housed outside on the ship's landing platform) would not start because the ship \"went through a major rain storm for 2 days and it [the helicopter engine] got too much water in it.\" He also noted that \"there were a lot of dry starts\" and that an actual start \"didn't go well,\" resulting in \"smoke and oil everywhere.\" He further noted that the dry starts were \"pushing too much oil into the engine so when it finally started all that oil came out.\" The pilot indicated that the problem had been resolved and that he had subsequently conducted a 1.5-hour flight. Finally, he indicated that he would be \"flying again soon.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGlassy Water Operations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Seaplane, Skiplane, and Float/Ski Equipped Helicopter Operations Manual (FAA-H-8083-23) presented information regarding landings on glassy water. The manual stated, in part, the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlat, calm, glassy water certainly looks inviting and may give the pilot a false sense of safety.…Unfortunately…the visual…characteristics of glassy water hold potential hazards for complacent pilots. Consequently, this surface condition is frequently more dangerous than it appears.… The visual aspects of glassy water make it difficult to judge…height above the water. The lack of surface features can make accurate depth perception very difficult, even for experienced…pilots. Without adequate knowledge of the…height above the surface, the pilot may…fly into the water at relatively high speed.… Besides the lack of surface features, the smooth, reflecting surface can lead to confusing illusions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe manual also stated that \"there are some simple ways to overcome the visual illusions and increase safety\" when operating over glassy water, including using nearby objects, such as shorelines or boats, to aid in maintaining depth perception and altitude awareness.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nControlled Flight into Terrain&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA defines a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accident as one that \"occurs when an airworthy aircraft is flown, under the control of a qualified pilot, into terrain (water or obstacles) with inadequate awareness on the part of the pilot of the impending collision.\" In April 2003, the FAA published Advisory Circular (AC) 61-134, \"General Aviation Controlled Flight into Terrain Awareness.\" According to the AC, it \"identifies some, but not all, of the risks associated with GA CFIT accidents, and provides some recommendations and strategies to combat CFIT within the GA community.\" One of these risks is loss of situational awareness.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AC defined \"situational awareness\" as the pilot's knowledge of \"what is happening around the aircraft at all times in both the vertical and horizontal planes. This includes the ability to project the near-term status and position of the aircraft in relation to other aircraft, terrain, and other potential hazards.\" - FAA records indicated that the accident helicopter was manufactured in 1978 and was equipped with a Rolls-Royce (Allison) 250-C20B turboshaft engine. VSC records indicated that as of June 30, 2018, the helicopter had accrued a total time in service of about 17,560 hours, and the engine had a total time of about 15,645 hours. The records also indicated that the accident engine had been removed from another VSC helicopter and installed in the accident helicopter on that date. - On July 5, 2018, about 0914 local time (coordinated universal time [UTC] + 12 hours), an MD Helicopters (Hughes) 369D helicopter, N8648F, impacted the Pacific Ocean near the Republic of Nauru in the Marshall Islands about 20 seconds after liftoff from a Taiwan-registered fishing ship. The commercial pilot and the non pilot-rated observer (who was the designated fish-spotter) received fatal injuries. The helicopter was destroyed by impact forces and salt water immersion. The helicopter was registered to Vertol Systems Company (VSC) of Hillsboro, Oregon, and operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 aerial observation flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. No flight plan was filed for the flight, which was originating at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no known recorded communications between the helicopter and the ship before or during the accident flight. A forward-facing surveillance video camera on the ship captured the helicopter's liftoff and water impact. The permanent-type float-equipped helicopter was positioned on the ship's landing platform, which was about 40 ft above the waterline. The sky was clear, the sea state was calm, and the water surface was glassy in appearance, with no waves and minimal swells. While on the platform, the helicopter faced about 45° to port (left). The left-side of the helicopter was visible and revealed that the left cockpit door was not installed. The helicopter lifted off and began an immediate descending right turn of about 90° heading change and disappeared off the right edge of the image frame. It then re-entered the image frame, traveling from right to left, well ahead of the ship's bow. The helicopter was sufficiently low that it left visible disturbances on the water surface behind it. While still flying forward, the helicopter contacted the surface of the water and immediately nosed over into an inverted position. The wreckage remained afloat, but the low resolution of the image prevented any determination of its condition.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ship captain's statement indicated that two \"skiff boats\" were dispatched to \"rescue\" the helicopter occupants. Both occupants were recovered from inside the helicopter, but they were not able to be resuscitated. The wreckage was recovered and secured on the deck of the ship. No other significant details were provided in the ship captain's statement or accompanying incident report. Subsequent documentation showed that the helicopter was placed lying on its right side for transport to shore. About 4 days after the accident, the helicopter was delivered to the VSC facility on the atoll of Majuro in the Marshall Islands. VSC personnel righted and then partially disassembled the helicopter for storage in a temperature- and humidity-controlled shipping container, where it remained until examined by investigators a few months later. - No autopsy was conducted on the pilot prior to embalming and transport back to the US. An autopsy was performed by the US Armed Forces Medical Examiner Office at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware. The autopsy report concluded that there was no significant natural disease or trauma, and that the pilot's cause of death was \"probable drowning.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing detected the presence of chlorpheniramine, (brand name Chlor-Trimeton) a sedating antihistamine, in the pilot's liver. This over-the-counter antihistamine helps control cold and allergy symptoms and may be used as a sleep aid. This medication can slow reaction times and may impair the mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks. Because this medication has a long elimination half-life (12 to 48 hours), the FAA recommends waiting 5 days after the last dose to perform airman duties. No other screened drugs of abuse or medications were detected in the pilot's specimens. - Meteorological information provided by VSC included wind speed less than 10 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear skies, and temperature 31°C. - VSC leased helicopters and pilots to multiple companies, including foreign fishing companies operating in the southern and western Pacific Ocean. VSC had a logistics and maintenance base on Majuro (in the south Pacific Ocean) to facilitate these operations. Helicopters and pilots under contract were stationed on fishing ships, but no helicopter maintenance personnel were stationed on the ships. VSC would provide ship-board maintenance and maintenance personnel on a temporary, as-required basis. According to the available evidence, no VSC maintenance personnel were aboard the fishing ship during the days before or on the day of the accident. - Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records indicated that the US pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter ratings and a flight instructor certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. Records and information provided by VSC were incomplete. As of November 2016, the pilot had accumulated about 650 hours of total flight experience, including about 428 hours in turbine-powered helicopters. According to information provided by VSC, the pilot began flying for VSC in 2017. VSC did not provide any information regarding the pilot's flight time at VSC. The pilot's most recent VSC \"Annual Competency Check\" flight review was completed in March 2018, and his most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued in October 2017. - The wreckage was examined in Majuro about 2 months after the accident. The fuselage was mostly intact, but most of the tailboom was absent. All four landing gear struts and braces were attached to the fuselage. Crush and skin deformation were observed along the upper portions of the aft fuselage, tailboom fairing, and the upper aft left side of the cockpit. Both aft (cabin) doors were present and attached. Both front (cockpit) doors were absent, and damage patterns were consistent with those doors not being installed for the accident flight. Most windscreen and cabin Plexiglas were absent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit retained most of its original volume. The \"OFF/ON\" key, battery switch, and start pump switch were all set to their respective \"ON\" positions, and the fuel valve handle was found in its open, fuel on position. No seat pan deformation of either forward seat was observed. Both seats were equipped with four-point harnesses. Both lap belts had been cut, presumably by ship personnel during rescue/recovery efforts. The harness webbing remained connected to the inertia reels, which operated normally.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight controls were installed only at the left cockpit station. Collective control continuity was verified to the top of the tunnel-routed control tube. The cyclic stick was connected to the lateral lower control tube and the lower bell crank, but the upper ends of the control tubes were fractured. The antitorque pedals remained attached and free to move. Continuity was established from the pedals to the upper end of the control tube.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMost of the tailboom, including the tail rotor, tail rotor transmission, and vertical and horizontal stabilizers, had separated from the helicopter and were not recovered. Both the tail rotor drive shaft and the tail rotor pitch control tube were truncated at the location of the tailboom separation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub remained attached to the main rotor drive shaft, which remained splined into the main transmission. The helicopter had five main rotor blades. The red and white main rotor blades were wrapped around the rotor head multiple times. A 32-inch section of the yellow main rotor blade remained attached to the hub; the remaining section of the blade was absent. The blue and green main rotor blades were absent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main transmission was securely attached to the airframe, but was damaged by saltwater corrosion, and mechanically seized. No metal particles were observed on the transmission chip detectors. The engine-to-transmission drive shaft remained connected at both ends. The tail rotor drive shaft remained connected to the main transmission. No distortion or other abnormalities of the KAflex couplings were found. The freewheel unit was removed, and it manually rotated smoothly in one direction and locked in the other direction, consistent with the unit's design.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained securely mounted to the airframe with evidence of some external impact damage. The oil reservoir was overfilled, consistent with oil migration due to the helicopter being on its side while in transit to Majuro. The scavenge oil filter was clean, and a minor amount of sludge and a black plastic-like fragment were observed on the pressure oil filter element. Both engine chip detectors were free of ferrous material. Separately, the engine oil system was equipped with a check valve that could occasionally become stuck open, and permit oil to enter the engine gearbox. That oil would then be ejected or burned during engine start-up, but this condition would not have any adverse effect on normal engine operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThrottle and power turbine governor linkages were both continuous from the collective control to their respective engine components and moved freely. The compressor inlet and first-stage wheel showed no foreign object damage. The N1 rotor did not rotate in either direction. The N2 rotor did not rotate in the drive direction but rotated in the opposite direction. The 4th stage turbine wheel was undamaged. After the turbine module was separated from the gearbox, both the N1 and N2 rotors rotated freely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll engine fuel line connections were secure, and all fuel lines contained fuel. A vacuum check of the fuel system did not reveal any air leaks. A leak check of the pneumatic system that controls engine power was attempted, but an obstruction in the power turbine governor Pc air input tee prevented a full test. According to the Rolls-Royce representative, this clogging was consistent with saltwater immersion. The engine fuel system components were removed, and the lines were inspected; no cracks or abnormalities were observed. The airframe and engine-mounted fuel filters had no contaminants. A total of 23 gallons of fuel was drained from the helicopter. A fuel sample was clear and straw colored, with no contamination or water visible.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll observed damage was consistent with water impact and immersion, and/or severing of the tailboom. The airframe and engine examinations did not reveal any pre-impact abnormalities &#x0D;\nthat would have precluded normal operation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The private pilot and three passengers were on a personal local flight. A passenger stated that the first few minutes of the flight were normal, but he then felt what he described as \"a pull from the ground,\" and the helicopter started to descend. He reported hearing a \"beep beep\" sound, which is consistent with an engine out warning. The passenger reported that the pilot subsequently attempted to land on a road, but the passenger felt the helicopter \"just fall down and crash.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the postaccident examination of the helicopter, 9.5 ounces of engine oil were drained from the oil supply tank, and 6 ounces of engine oil, which contained some metallic debris were drained from the accessory gearbox; however, no significant anomalies were noted following testing of the drained oil.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine bearings Nos. 2.5, 6, and 8 did not contain any oil. Noted damage to all of the main bearings was consistent with thermal distress. Slight oil streaking was noted on both sides of the aft fuselage; the source of the oil could not be determined and most likely occurred postaccident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMaterial loss of the No. 2 bearing due to a loss of oil resulted in a loss of axial support of the compressor impeller by the No. 2 bearing, allowing forward axial movement of the compressor impeller from its normal position. The compressor impeller eventually contacted the compressor shroud, resulting in a sudden decrease in N1 rpm and a loss of engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe passengers account of the pilot's behavior did not suggest that the pilot was confused or had difficulty in responding to the inflight emergency; therefore, it is unlikely that any of the pilot's known medical conditions or use of medications contributed to the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The engine was equipped with nine main bearings (Nos. 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8), six stages of axial compressor, a single centrifugal compressor (impeller) and four stages of turbine disks. The gear-driven engine-driven oil pump, and scavenge pump are responsible for lubrication and scavenging of oil to and from the main bearings. A metal oil filter provides for capturing contaminants as well as upper and lower chip detectors in the accessory gearbox. The oil is retained in the oil tank, plumbed to the engine via flexible hoses, and returns from the engine to the oil cooler before it is returned to the engine. - On June 30, 2018, about 1255 Atlantic standard time, a Bell 206B, N10CV, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico. The private pilot was fatally injured, and three passengers sustained minor injuries. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter departed from Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport (TJIG), San Juan, Puerto Rico, about 1236 and was destined for Villa Marina Heliport (PR26), Fajardo, Puerto Rico. The passenger in the right rear seat stated that the first few minutes of the flight were normal, then he felt what he described as \"a pull from the ground,\" and the helicopter started to descend. The passenger in the left front seat reported that, a few seconds before ground impact, he observed a 0 reading on the torque meter and more than two lights illuminate on the instrument panel. The pilot then said, \"we lost the engine, we need to land\" and started looking for a landing spot. The passenger in the rear right seat reported hearing a \"beep beep\" sound, which is consistent with an engine out warning. He stated that the pilot attempted to land on a road, but the passenger felt the helicopter \"just fall down and crash.\" - An autopsy of the pilot was performed by the Gobierno de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The cause of death was blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory on fluid and tissue specimens from the pilot returned negative results for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and drugs of abuse. Testing identified the presence of prescribed medications used to treat the pilot's known medical conditions; none of which are considered impairing. Testing also identified 0.092 ug/ml of diphenhydramine (a sedating antihistamine available over the counter in multiple cold, allergy, sleep-aid products) in the pilot's blood.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDiphenhydramine can impair cognitive and psychomotor performance and cause drowsiness. It typically carries a warning that it may impair performance of tasks like driving and operating heavy machinery. However, diphenhydramine undergoes significant postmortem redistribution; its postmortem central blood levels may increase by about three times. - A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector examined the helicopter where it came to rest, upright and canted to the right, about 19 miles from TJIG and about 9 miles northwest of PR26. It sustained substantial damage to the fuselage and main rotor system. All major components were accounted for at the scene. The inspector noted a slight amount of oil streaking on the left and right sides of the aft fuselage during the initial examination. The oil tank was undamaged, and no oil was present.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the mechanic, the oil pressure torque tube assembly, located in the cabin overhead area, was replaced 2 days before the accident, which included adding less than 1 quart of oil; the helicopter was approved for return to service. During postaccident examination, there was no evidence of oil leakage from the replaced line.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the oil supply system revealed the engine oil tank remained secured to the airframe by the forward and aft tank supports and was not damaged. The oil filler cap was in place and was capable of being properly secured to the tank; no cracks were noted. The oil level in the tank did not register on the dipstick portion of the cap. About 9.5 ounces of oil were drained from the oil supply tank, lines connected to the tank and oil cooler, as well as from the oil filter. The oil filter was not in bypass, and the oil filter element contained a small amount of contaminants. No oil leaks were noted at the oil cooler.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll flexible oil supply hoses were intact and remained tightly secured to the oil tank, oil cooler, oil filter, and aft firewall fittings. No excessive oil leakage or stains were noted in the area of these components. The hoses were disconnected from the tank, which was removed from the helicopter. Although examination of the hoses from the engine to the aft firewall fittings found they contained minimal residual oil, no oil was noted between the hose exterior and fire sleeve interior. Testing of the hoses revealed they were in good condition with no leaks noted during pressure testing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed it remained securely attached to the airframe within the engine bay with the engine mounts remaining intact. No visible external impact damage was noted to the engine. Application of aircraft battery power confirmed an illuminated engine chip light on the master caution panel. Engine oil drained from the accessory gearbox measured less than 6 ounces and contained a slight amount of metallic debris; however, no significant anomalies were noted following testing of the drained oil.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll engine bearings were visually and tactilely examined. The No. 1 bearing was oil coated and rotationally free and smooth. The No. 2 bearing exhibited heavy cage damage with all balls being retained; however, all balls exhibited a deformed or out of round appearance. The No. 2.5 bearing was dry with all balls in place. The No. 3 bearing was oil coated with light drag upon rotation. The No. 4 bearing was oil coated, rotationally free and smooth. The No. 5 bearing displayed heavy drag upon rotation with noted spalling to all balls. The No. 6 bearing was dry, with light drag and displayed light scoring noted to the rollers. The No. 7 bearing was oil coated but was not rotationally free due to metal material seizing the rollers. The No. 8 bearing was visibly dry and rotationally free with light drag.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe damage noted to all the main bearings (except for Nos. 3 and 4) was consistent with thermal distress, with amber discoloration displayed on every surface. Examination of the oil delivery tubes did not reveal any blockages to the oil ports. Disassembly of the compressor revealed heavy circumferential rub damage to the compressor shroud with corresponding damage noted to the compressor impeller.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther examination of the helicopter confirmed flight control continuity for the collective, anti-torque, and the cyclic. No preimpact anomalies were noted with the fuel and hydraulic systems or the main and tail rotor drive systems. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot of the helicopter was approaching to land on a trailer following a short local flight. A witness saw the pilot abort the landing approach and stated that the helicopter backed away from the trailer, began to climb, then entered a \"violent\" counterclockwise spin as it climbed to about 20 to 25 ft above the ground. The helicopter spun 4 or 5 times, then the witness heard a loud noise like an engine backfire and the helicopter \"fell\" to the ground and came to rest on its right side. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe, drive systems, flight controls, and engine did not reveal any pre-impact mechanical anomalies that would have resulted in a loss of control. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was configured with a single set of flight controls (pedals, collective, and cyclic)  on the right side; the left side controls were not installed, and the cover plate for the removed left pedal assembly was not installed. Three metal ammunition boxes containing tools and loose shotgun shells were recovered from the debris field. During postaccident examination, the boxes were placed on the left side floor to determine whether they may have interfered with pedal movement. The edge of the most-forward box covered the top of the left side pedal receiver when the right pedal was positioned aft of neutral. Shotgun shells were recovered from the left floor area, the belly area, and in the debris field. One shell had a dent in the plastic shell; however, the origin of the dent could not be confirmed. Due to impact damage to the floor and pedal assemblies, whether any of these items may have interfered with pedal movement during the flight could not be determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had over 20,000 hours in the type of helicopter. No mechanical anomalies were found that could have precluded normal operations. It is possible that the counterclockwise spin could have been a result of pedal control interference from the ammo cans or shotgun shells on the uncovered left pedal assembly; however, control interference could not be determined conclusively.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter was configured with a single set of flight controls (pedals, collective, and cyclic) at the right seat. The left seat pilot controls were not installed, and the cover plate for the removed left pedal assembly was not installed. The operator stated that the helicopter was routinely used in cattle roundup and predator mitigation operations. The helicopter had flown a previous flight of about 3.7 hours on the morning of the accident. The pilot who conducted that flight did not report any anomalies with the helicopter. - On June 29, 2018, about 2010 central daylight time, a Robinson R22B, N787SH, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Sterling, Texas. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 work use flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flight was to inspect a nearby stock water tank and inoperative water pump. The pilot had completed the flight and was returning to land on the helicopter's trailer when the accident occurred.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was located at the home base, stated that she saw the helicopter make an approach to land on the trailer, but the pilot aborted the landing, and the helicopter backed away from the trailer and climbed. The helicopter then began \"a violent spin\" as it climbed to 20 to 25 ft above the ground. The helicopter spun 4 or 5 times, then the witness heard a loud noise like an engine backfire and the helicopter \"fell\" to the ground. She could not recall whether she heard the engine producing power following the backfire noise. The witness stated that she thought the spin was in the counterclockwise direction but was not positive. She did not see the impact because of building obstructions. The engine was not running when she reached the helicopter. - South Plains Forensic Pathology, Lubbock, Texas, performed an autopsy of the pilot. The pilot's cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Forensic Sciences Laboratory performed toxicology testing on the pilot's tissue samples. The toxicology tests were negative for drugs and ethanol. Small amounts of over-the-counter medicine for hay fever and allergies were present. - A company pilot reported that the wind was about 10-12 knots from the south about the time of the accident. - The accident site was located about 200 ft from its intended landing site on the transport trailer. The helicopter impacted level terrain and came to rest on its right side. There was no evidence of contact with obstructions during the approach. The fuselage sustained impact damage to its lower right side. Both pilot and passenger doors were not installed. Three ammunition cans containing tools and several loose shotgun shells (discharged and undischarged) were present within the wreckage area. Several shotgun shells were recovered from the left floor area, the belly area, and in the debris field. One shotgun shell had a dent in the plastic shell.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any pre-impact mechanical anomalies. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the cockpit to the flight control surfaces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ammunition boxes were placed on the left side cockpit floor to observe the geometry of the boxes in relation to the removed left pedal assembly. The edge of the most-forward box covered the top of the left side pedal receiver when the right pedal was positioned aft of neutral. Due to impact damage the position of the ammunition boxes and dented shotgun shell during the flight could not be determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDetailed airframe and engine examination findings are included in the public docket for this accident. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot of the helicopter had just finished a low-level aerial photography flight of a boating event along a series of lakes and rivers. The pilot landed the helicopter, off-loaded the photographer, and departed to a nearby airport to refuel. Witnesses and surveillance video indicated that the helicopter was flying northwest over the river when, about 1/2 mile from the takeoff location, it contacted two lines of an unmarked   five-line array that crossed about 100 ft above the river. The tail rotor separated from the helicopter, and the helicopter subsequently impacted the river.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe photographer reported that they had flown over numerous bridges and power lines during the earlier flight and that they had discussed the location of the power lines in reference to the bridges.   Examination of the airframe revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot flying at an unnecessarily low altitude and then failing to maintain clearance from the wires while flying at low level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "On June 9, 2018, at 1229 central daylight time, a Robinson R44 helicopter, N529DW, was substantially damaged when it collided with wires during a low-level flight in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. The pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to and operated by MF Helicopters LLC as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 aerial photography flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed near the accident site at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which originated about 1226 from a field near the accident site and was en route to Wittman Field (OSH), Oshkosh, Wisconsin.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was engaged in aerial photography operations for a boating event on Lake Winnebago. The helicopter was operating from a field on the Fox River, about 1/2 mile southeast of the accident site. The pilot and a photographer were airborne for about 1 1/2 hours flying at low altitude over a series of lakes and waterways while photographing the event. The photographer stated that he and the pilot flew over several bridges and sets of power lines during the flight, and they discussed that many of the bridges had power lines near them. He stated that there were no problems with the helicopter during their flight. The pilot then dropped off the photographer at the field before departing for OSH to refuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA surveillance camera captured the helicopter flying northwest  when it struck wires that crossed  a river. The video showed the helicopter pitching up as it struck the wires. The tail rotor separated from the helicopter and the helicopter descended into the water. Numerous witnesses also reported seeing the helicopter contact the wires and descend into the water. - The Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, performed an autopsy of the pilot. The pilot's death was attributed to drowning with blunt force trauma to the head.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Research Sciences Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology testing on specimens of the pilot. Testing was negative for carbon monoxide, cyanide, ethanol, and drugs in the testing profile. - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter ratings. He also held a flight instructor certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. The pilot's logbook contained entries between August 28, 2013, and May 30, 2018. The logbook showed that the pilot had 559.6 total hours of flight experience, all of which were in Robinson R44 helicopters. The pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration second-class medical certificate that was issued on May 24, 2017. The medical certificate did not list any limitations. - The helicopter contacted a static wire and a fiber optic line, which were the top two lines of an unmarked five-line array that crossed over the Fox River.   The lines were about 100 ft above the water and spanned about 640 ft across the river.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter wreckage was located in the river about 300 ft northwest of the wire strike and was subsequently recovered. The entire structure of the helicopter sustained impact damage. Both skids remained attached to the helicopter. The floats were not deployed during the accident sequence but were inadvertently deployed during the wreckage examination. The cockpit area was crushed to the right and the left side of the canopy was missing. The floor of the cockpit was crushed upward.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blades remained attached to the helicopter. Continuity of the main rotor system was established from the cockpit controls to the blades. A 180-ft section of 7-strand steel cable was wrapped around the main rotor hub and both rotor blades. The cable cut through one of the blades from the trailing edge to the blade spar about 66 inches from the blade tip and cut through the other blade about 38 inches from the blade tip. Numerous cable marks were visible on both blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor separated from the helicopter during the accident sequence and was not located. The tailboom, tail rotor drive shaft, and tail rotor push-pull tube were fractured about 4 ft aft of the forward flex plate. The tail rotor drive shaft remained attached at the forward flex plate, which was deformed. Continuity of the tail rotor drive system was established from the cockpit to the fractures in the tailboom. Examination of the airframe revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot and two crewmembers of the helicopter were performing external load operations to repair high-tension power line structures. The pilot reported that, during the fourth repair of the flight, he was hovering the helicopter next to the power line structure when he noticed a \"rumbling\" and the helicopter descending. The helicopter impacted the ground beneath the structure, seriously injuring one of the two crewmembers, while the second crewmember sustained fatal injuries. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. The power line structure displayed paint transfer consistent in color with that of the helicopter. There was also a puncture hole about 6 inches in length under the upper horizontal plate of the structure, consistent with the dimensions of a main rotor blade. Therefore, it is likely that the pilot failed to maintain clearance from the power line structure while hovering, resulting in contact with the structure.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On May 20, 2018, at 1049 central daylight time, an MD Helicopters, Inc. 369D helicopter, N362JS, was destroyed when it collided with a power line structure and impacted terrain while performing an aerial repair near Luling, Louisiana. The commercial pilot sustained minor injuries, one crewmember sustained serious injuries, and a second crewmember sustained fatal injuries. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Air2 LLC as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 external load operation. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and a company flight plan was filed for the flight, which originated from Port of South Louisiana Executive Regional Airport (APS), Reserve, Louisiana, at 0936.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator stated that the accident occurred while the pilot and crewmembers were attempting to position a shield wire to a bracket that had separated from the end of the \"goat head\" arm, which extended from the power line support structure. The goat head arm was approximately 13 ft in length, and the goat head end that the bracket was secured to was positioned 8 ft vertically above the horizontal support structure arm. The goat head held a shield wire in position above high-tension power lines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that he arrived at APS about 0700, conducted a preflight inspection of the helicopter, and found no discrepancies. He discussed the job hazard analysis and repair plan with his crewmembers, and they decided that the flight would be a good opportunity to train the second crewmember on skid work and allow him to observe the work being performed. After departing, the original crewmember performed the first repair and the second crewmember performed two more. They then proceeded to the next structure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe structure shield wire had already fallen from the shield wire arm and was laying on top of the conductor arm on a steel frame. They planned to hang a chain hoist below the helicopter to hook the shield wire and attach the other end of the hoist to the static arm in order to raise the shield wire pack into position. The pilot was hovering the helicopter over the conductor arm when he noticed a rumbling and the helicopter descending. The helicopter impacted the marsh area below on its left side. The pilot egressed and found the first crewmember conscious and lying next to the helicopter. The pilot was unable to locate the second crewmember and suspended his search because the engine was idling and a fire had ignited around the helicopter. The pilot used a fire extinguisher to put out the fire but quickly depleted the extinguisher.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness heard a boom/crack and responded to the accident location. He stated that a fire was surrounding the helicopter and that the pilot was waving for assistance. The witness, along with first responders, transported the pilot from the accident site. During the transport, the pilot stated that he \"hooked a skid and could not get it out.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe second crewmember, who sustained fatal injuries, was restrained to the helicopter by a harness that was connected to the outside of the helicopter via a D-ring and a lanyard that was connected in the aft cargo area. Once the helicopter was rolled over by rescue personnel to remove the passenger, the harness was cut, and the lanyard was disconnected. - Toxicology testing of the pilot performed at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for ethanol and tested-for drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing of the deceased crewmember performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory revealed carboxyhemoglobin in blood, no ethanol in vitreous, and yohimbine in blood and urine. - The helicopter came to rest on its left side beneath the power line structure in marshy terrain and was submerged in about 3 ft of water. The main wreckage comprised the fuselage, skids, main rotor head with two blades attached, and a portion of the tail boom. A 5-ft section of the tail boom and the tail rotor driveshaft were located in trees adjacent to the main wreckage. The aft section of the tail boom, including the tail rotor assembly, was about 25 ft south of the main wreckage. Two main rotor blades were located about 100 ft south of the main wreckage, and one main rotor blade was located about 50 ft south of the main wreckage. The canopy structure was fragmented and the left cockpit/cabin door and right cockpit door frames were crushed and deformed. The lower fuselage sustained damage in the area where all four landing gear struts passed through the fuselage. The left forward strut was fractured, and the left aft strut was undamaged. The left and right skids were intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom displayed partial separations near its forward fuselage attachment and near the horizontal stabilizer. Damage near the forward fuselage attachment exhibited features of a main rotor blade strike. The tail rotor transmission and the horizontal and vertical stabilizers were attached and secured to the tail boom. The tail rotor blades were separated outboard of the blade root fittings and were not recovered. The main rotor blade spars and skins were wrinkled, bent, and torn. Three of the main rotor blades were separated from the main rotor hub at the pitch housing assemblies, which remained attached to the root end of the blades, and two main rotor blades remained attached to the hub.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was confirmed from the cyclic and collective cockpit controls through overload fractures of the control system to the main rotor swashplate. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the antitorque pedals through overload fractures of the tail boom control rod to the tail rotor pitch control assembly and tail rotor blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lateral and longitudinal flight control trim actuators were tested using battery power with the actuation of trim control switch. The trim actuators extended and retracted normally. The tail rotor swashplate bearing and pitch control assembly operated normally when moved by hand. The tail rotor gearbox rotated freely when moved by hand; no binding was felt.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain rotor and tail rotor drive continuity from the engine driveshaft through the main transmission was confirmed. There was no ferrous debris on the main transmission and tail rotor gearbox chip detectors.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine to main transmission driveshaft was separated at the overrunning clutch flex coupling. The flex coupling bolts and nuts were in place, and the flex coupling plates fractured. The main transmission was rotated by hand through the input drive shaft and the gear train moved smoothly, freely, and without binding. The main rotor head moved with movement of the input drive shaft. A liquid consistent with oil was present in the main transmission oil level sight glass.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to its mounts and was displaced toward the left due to impact damage, which also damaged the left side compressor discharge tubes and burner can. Engine control continuity from the cockpit controls to the engine power turbine governor (PTG) and fuel control unit (FCU) was confirmed. The FCU indicator was at the ground idle position. Liquid consistent with Jet A fuel was found in the fuel line leading to the fuel nozzle. The airframe oil filter did not contain metallic debris. There was no ferrous debris on either of the two engine chip detectors. The first stage compressor blades were undamaged, and the compressor (N1 rotor) turned freely using hand pressure. The gas producer turbine blades were present, intact, and undamaged. The gas producer turbine rotor was continuous to the compressor, which rotated freely using hand pressure.  Continuity from the fourth-stage power turbine wheel to the power output shaft was also established.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe top of the goat head comprised a 1-inch thick horizontal plate on which a bracket was mounted that held the shield cable shoe hardware. The shield cable mounting bracket had been sheared off and was not recovered. All four of the attaching 1/2-inch diameter bolts were sheared flush with the face of the plate. One bolt face displayed red paint transfer. The upper plate exhibited red paint transfer on the face and one side/edge. The paint transfers were consistent in color with that of the helicopter, which was painted red. There was a puncture hole under the upper horizontal plate about 6 inches in length that was consistent with the dimensions of a main rotor blade. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter pilot and two emergency medical service crewmembers were on a repositioning flight in night visual meteorological conditions after two helicopter air ambulance flights and a refueling stop. The total flight time for the first three flights was 94 minutes and occurred over a period of about 2 ½ hours. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter departed on the accident flight about 2107. About 1 minute later, the pilot asked the crewmembers whether they were \"alright.\" One crewmember responded \"yup\" and then asked the pilot, \"question is are you alright up there?\" The pilot responded, \"uhhh think so. Good enough to get us home at least.\" There was no further discussion related to fatigue. During the flight, the pilot adjusted his seat position and flexed his legs, which were actions consistent with signs of fatigue. Also, although the pilot participated in the medical crewmembers' conversations in the middle of the flight, he did not participate in their conversations near the end of the flight. During the last portion of flight, the helicopter entered a progressively steepening right bank, and the pilot did not respond as the medical crewmembers shouted his name. The helicopter descended and became inverted, and the pilot continued not to respond as the crewmembers' shouted his name.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the helicopter began to roll to the right, the pilot slumped to the left, appearing incapacitated. There was no evidence indicating that the pilot was suffering from a medical condition that could have caused his incapacitation. There was also no evidence of poor quality or quantity of sleep; the pilot's wife reported no issues with the pilot falling asleep or staying asleep, and cellular telephone records and his wife's interview indicated adequate sleep opportunity in the days preceding the accident. On the day of the accident, cellular telephone activity revealed two possible opportunities for the pilot to sleep before going on duty but it is not known if the pilot rested during those times. Thus, the pilot could have been awake for about 15.5 hours at the time of the accident (based on telephone records showing activity at 0725 the morning of the accident) if he did not take advantage of the sleep opportunities. Although this time since awakening would not be considered excessive, this accident shift was the pilot's first after returning from a week-long vacation during which his circadian rhythm would have had him sleeping. Further, the environment created by the helicopter vibration, darkness of night, and few operational demands during the cruise phase of flight would have increased the pilot's fatigue and the body's biological desire to sleep. These factors, along with the pilot's movements observed on the image recorder, indicated that the pilot became fatigued during the flight. Thus, he pilot likely fell asleep during the flight as a result of the time of day, his time since awakening, and the fatigue-inducing effect of the 1 ½ hour flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo light or audio warnings that would indicate a mechanical malfunction were observed during the  accident flight. Postaccident examination and testing revealed no preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The operator's general operations manual defined a scheduled duty period as \"12 scheduled consecutive hours that may be extended to 14 hours\" and a rest period as \"10 scheduled hours of rest that are consecutive, known in advance and free from all restraint.\" The manual further stated the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilots and certificate managers are responsible for ensuring compliance with the flight time limitations and rest requirements. Pilots will report for duty with the appropriate rest and be capable of performing their assigned flight crewmember duties. At any time a flight crewmember becomes medically or physically unfit for duty they shall vocally notify the appropriate aviation manager, [and] self-ground .&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator disseminated periodic publications on various topics that included fatigue risk management. For example, the winter 2017 edition of the operator's \"Safety Connect\" publication included a special in-depth feature titled \"Drained: Examining the Causes &amp; Remedies of Fatigue.\" The publication discussed factors that increase fatigue, such as dim lighting, limited visual acuity, high temperatures, high noise, high comfort, tasks over long periods of time, and long, repetitive, monotonous tasks. The feature also included information from the FAA's Advisory Circular 120-115, \"Maintainer Fatigue Risk Management.\" - The helicopter was configured for helicopter air ambulance services.  The helicopter was equipped with a radar altimeter and a Honeywell MK XXI enhanced ground proximity warning system. - On April 26, 2018, about 2243 central daylight time, a Eurocopter AS350 B2 helicopter, N127LN, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Hazelhurst, Wisconsin. The commercial pilot and two emergency medical services crewmembers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 repositioning flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, Air Methods Corporation, the pilot and the medical crewmembers transported a patient from the Howard Young Medical Center Heliport (60WI), Woodruff, Wisconsin, to the Merrill Municipal Airport (RRL), Merrill, Wisconsin, departing about 1759 and arriving about 1819. The helicopter then departed from RRL about 1832 with another patient aboard and landed at the UW Hospital and Clinics Heliport (WS27), Madison, Wisconsin, about 1937. The patient was offloaded, and the helicopter departed WS27 about 2028 for refueling at Dane County Regional Airport (MSN), Madison, Wisconsin, arriving about 2037.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 2104, the pilot radioed the operator to report that the helicopter was ready to depart MSN for 60WI. According to information from the helicopter's on-board Appareo Vision 1000 recorder (which records image, audio, and parametric data), the pilot conducted a preflight of the helicopter with the engine operating, and no anomalies were detected. Yawning and sighs were heard. The pilot requested clearance to 60WI and departed about 2107. About 1 minute later, the pilot asked if the medical crew was \"alright back there,\" and one of the medical crewmembers responded \"yup.\" One of the medical crewmembers then stated, \"question is are you alright up there?\" The pilot responded, \"uhhh think so. Good enough to get us home at least.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 2200, a medical crewmember stated, \"I could go to sleep,\" and the pilot responded, \"yeah that'd be nice huh.\" About 2205, the pilot made a radio call to Central Wisconsin Airport's radio frequency. Recorded weather information was heard, and the pilot subsequently made a position announcement. After about 2215, the medical crewmembers started non-aviation-related conversations, and the pilot was last heard during the conversations about 2229. Between about 2215 and 2242, the pilot made movements including raising his left arm near his helmet (which was mounted with night vision goggles), flexing his legs, adjusting his seating position, and changing cyclic position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 2243, the helicopter was operating in level flight at an airspeed of 126 knots and an altitude of at 2,280 ft mean sea level (msl). The artificial horizon indicator then showed the initiation of a right bank. The pilot's right forearm started moving along with the cyclic to the right, and the artificial horizon indicated a bank between 10° and 15°. The roll rate to the right appeared to increase rapidly, and the pilot's body, right forearm, and right hand (which was holding the base of the cyclic grip) appeared to move along with the increased roll rate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA medical crewmember stated \"what are we doin'?\" twice. The pilot's head moved to the right and could no longer be seen in the image, and the right bank increased to more than 90°. A medical crewmember stated, in a strained voice, \"Ohhh [expletive].\" The crewmember then shouted \"what?\" and the pilot's name. The other medical crewmember also shouted the pilot's name. The pilot's head returned to the image and moved to the left. His right hand still gripped the cyclic. The artificial horizon showed an inverted indication, and the torque gauge indicated a value beyond the red line. The emergency locator transmitter light illuminated while the pilot's head and upper body moved to the left. Sounds similar to a rotor high rpm horn and a grunt were recorded, along with a medical crewmember shouting the pilot's name. The recording contained no response from the pilot when the crewmembers shouted his name. The artificial horizon indicated a right roll of more than 270° with a pitch-down attitude, the altimeter indicated 1,900 ft msl, and the airspeed indicator showed 98 knots. The last two frames showed that the pilot's head and upper body had moved to the right and that the airspeed indicator displayed 70 knots, the artificial horizon indicated a 90° left bank with a pitch-down attitude, and the altimeter indicated 1,825 ft msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company's satellite tracking of helicopter showed a normal route of flight until contact was lost at 2243. The helicopter wreckage was found about 0215 the next day. - The University of Wisconsin Anatomic Pathology Laboratory performed an autopsy of the pilot. His cause of death was multiple traumatic injuries. Toxicology testing performed at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for ethanol and tested-for substances. - According to US Naval Observatory sun and moon data, the end of civil twilight in the Rhinelander, Wisconsin, area, 17 nm southwest of the accident site, on the day of the accident was 2031, and moonset was at 0507 the next day. The phase of the moon on the day of the accident was a waxing gibbous with 88% of the moon's visible disk illuminated. - The accident flight was the pilot's first flight after a week-long family vacation in Florida. According to cellular telephone records and an interview with the pilot's wife, the pilot had a sleep opportunity of more than 9 hours during each of the 6 nights before the accident. On April 25, 2018, the pilot and his family traveled to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on an early morning airline flight, had lunch in Milwaukee, and then made the 4-hour drive home. The trip from Florida to Wisconsin involved a change in time zones. Cellular telephone records indicated the pilot's activity from 1655 to 2038 with two extended breaks in activity (greater than 60 minutes) from 1658 to 1801 and from 1802 to 2011. The pilot's wife thought that he went to sleep between about 2100 and 2130.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe time that the pilot awoke on the day of the accident was not known. Cellular telephone records indicated his activity from 0725 to 2057 with three extended breaks in activity (greater than 60 minutes) from 0923 to 1118, 1431 to 1556, and 1741 to 2040.The pilot's wife stated that, before going on duty, he would normally rest and sleep during the day, but she did not know if he rested or slept during the day of the accident. The pilot's wife reported no issues with the pilot falling asleep or staying asleep.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's wife, who was also a pilot at Air Methods, was on duty on the day of the accident and worked the day shift. She saw her husband when he arrived at work for the night shift and thought that he had arrived about 45 minutes early for his shift. They did the shift change together, and she noted nothing unusual about her husband. . - Video Camera Analysis&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the request of the NTSB, the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile analyzed video from two cameras (located in parking lots near the accident site) that recorded the sounds of the helicopter during flight and the accident sequence. The spectral analysis showed that the acoustic signature of both the main and the tail rotors seemed to be nominal until the end of the recording. Engine condition and speed could not be determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA sudden decrease of the frequencies was detected 7.5 seconds before the end of the flight. The decrease was most likely due to a heading change and was followed by a slight reduction of the rotor speed. About 3.5 seconds before impact, the helicopter's rotor speed sharply increased, reaching in 2.5 seconds the average value of 125% rotor system speed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPerformance Study&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA  performance study for this accident was conducted using the recorded Appareo data. The study showed that, during the accident flight, the helicopter averaged groundspeeds between 90 and 115 knots and flew at altitudes between 800 and 1,100 ft above ground level. By 2240, the helicopter was about 1,300 ft above ground level, but the increase in altitude coincided with an increase in terrain elevation. At 2243:12, the helicopter's pitch and roll attitude began to increase; by 2243:21, the helicopter was fully inverted. During the last 6 seconds of recorded data (2243:18 to 2243:24), the helicopter began to rapidly lose altitude at a rate of about 5,000 ft per minute.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident flight was operated 200 to 600 ft lower and 20 to 40 knots slower than the three previously recorded flights, which were flown by the accident pilot. - The helicopter was found in a wooded area about 178° and 8.4 nautical miles from 60WI. The wreckage exhibited no signs of fire. A 70-ft-tall tree that was located about 66° and 47 ft from the nose of the wreckage had broken branches. Other trees between that tree and the wreckage had trunks and branches that were broken and linearly separated. A ground impression that was about 11 ft long, 9 ft wide, and 2 ft deep was found in front of the helicopter wreckage. The helicopter came to rest on its right side. The heading of the wreckage from the tail to the nose was about 095°. The smell of fuel was present at the site and in the ground below the helicopter. All major components of the helicopter were located at the site. The cockpit and cabin area was destroyed. The fuselage exhibited rearward crushing deformation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom was attached to the fuselage. The tail rotor gear box and tail rotor blades remained on the tail. The vertical fin had partially detached from the end of the tailboom. Both horizontal stabilizers were present on the tail. All three rotor blades remained attached to the rotor hub, which was attached to the transmission. The main rotor blades exhibited damage that includes spar fractures and leading edge abrasions and depressions. The main rotor hub rotated when the transmission input drive shaft was manually rotated. The fuel tank was fragmented. Yaw, pitch, lateral, and collective controls were traced from the cockpit to their respective servo actuators. Engine controls were traced from the cockpit through their respective bellcranks to their engine components. A magnetic plug in the hydraulic system had some particulate on its magnetic end. The filter bypass button on the hydraulic control block was popped.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic pump exhibited a suction and pressure at the pump's inlet and outlet. Disassembly of the hydraulic pump revealed scoring witness marks on the pump housing in its gear's plane of rotation, and no debris or obstructions were observed within the pump ports. Computed tomography images of the three main rotor actuators, showed some internal anomalies with the pitch actuator, including the presence of an unknown material next to the extend side end cap of the actuator and material consistent with the piston head seal in the extend side cavity of the actuator. The images shows no indications of internal anomalies in the left lateral and right lateral main rotor actuators, and tail rotor yaw actuators. The hydraulic pump and four actuators were subsequently examined by their manufacturers Visual examination of the components of the pump showed no abnormal indications, obvious wear, or defects, and the seals were in good condition. The pump was reassembled and tested, and the pump met the specifications for a new pump. Examination of the three main rotor actuators and the tail rotor actuator revealed that the damage they sustained was consistent with impact damage. No preimpact damage was found.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was found on the ground separated from the fuselage. The engine compressor blades exhibited nick and gouge damage consistent with foreign object ingestion. The power turbine blades exhibited silver-colored deposits. The power turbine was manually turned, but the drive train did not turn. Subsequent examination revealed that the engine's module 5 reduction gearbox had migrated rearward out of its installed position with its O-ring groove visible. The module 5 gearbox was removed for inspection of the input pinion torque alignment marks. The marks were found to be misaligned about 0.08 inch in the tightening direction, which is consistent with engine power being delivered to the drive train during the accident sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Appareo unit was found near the cockpit area. The download of the data found no light or audio warnings that would indicate a mechanical malfunction. Additionally, there was no recorded evidence of a bird strike. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot of the helicopter was conducting a power line construction flight. The power lines were supported by a series of structures made of either wood (dual-pole, H-frame) or steel (single pole). A static line was affixed to the top of the structures above the power lines. The purpose of the flight was to remove the static line from the wheeled, pulley device (dolly) that temporarily secured the static line and permanently secure the static line to the structures. One lineman completed the task from the skid of the hovering helicopter, and another lineman inside the helicopter passed tools and equipment back and forth to the lineman on the skid. The accident occurred when the crew (the pilot and the two linemen) were working on the second structure, which was constructed of wood. During work on that structure, the helicopter hovered facing westbound adjacent to the wooden structure with the pilot, both linemen, and the structure on the helicopter's left side. The static line sloped upward aft of the helicopter toward the uphill structure and downward and to the right toward the downhill structure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe initial steps taken for the task included wrapping the line with a spiraled wire coating (armor rod) and attaching a safety strap (safety). The lineman on the helicopter skid attached the first half of the armor rod ahead of the dolly and manipulated the line and the dolly to complete the wrap. According to the pilot, the lineman opened the spring-loaded locking gate on the dolly above the static line to wrap the second half of the armor rod, which was \"normal\" before the attachment of the safety. About that time, the pilot felt the helicopter being \"pulled\" toward the structure. The pilot stated that he made cyclic and pedal inputs to avoid the structure but reported that \"all I remember is rolling over the structure.\" The pilot stated that he neither felt nor heard anything unusual before the helicopter was pulled toward the structure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVisual examination of the static line, helicopter rotor blades, and visual and metallurgical examination of the dolly revealed that, as the lineman on the skid wrapped the armor rod, and before he attached the safety, the aft portion of the main rotor struck the static line, which broke the locking gate that secured the line inside the dolly. Once free of the dolly, the static line fell between the uphill and downhill structures and over the left front skid of the helicopter, which created the pivot point over which the helicopter rolled inverted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot and the linemen began work without installing a safety. According to the operator's director of safety, the safety strap aboard the helicopter was \"not long enough\" to install it before work began. The holding company of the subsidiary that hired the operator as an independent contractor had a safety manual for linemen who performed work from helicopters. The manual indicated that \"secondary securement systems shall be utilized\" when clipping wire (permanently securing a static line to the structures).",
    "FactualNarrative": "Organizational Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHigh Line Helicopters was hired as an independent contractor by J.W. Didado Electric, LLC, a subsidiary of Quanta Services, Inc., to transport J.W. Didado employees to job sites for new power line construction. First Energy Corporation hired J.W. Didado to perform the construction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a postaccident telephone interview, the NTSB asked the director of safety for High Line Helicopters about the task sequence and specifically why the safety strap was not installed first. He replied that the safety strap aboard the helicopter was \"not long enough\" to stay attached while the armor rod was being installed and that a \"choker safety\" should have been used. When asked if the company's standard operating procedures directed that the crew retrieve the choker safety, the director of safety replied, \"that is more or less a contractor thing\" and that High Line Helicopters did not have procedures for contractor equipment. When asked to describe operations \"inside the bite,\" the safety director stated that it was the area where, once the helicopter was inside it, the wire would move toward the helicopter if the wire became loose from the dolly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nQuanta Services published a safety manual with detailed guidelines and a skills proficiency sheet, also referred to as a grade slip, for linemen who performed their work from helicopters. Section 14, Helicopter Safety, Rigging, page 14-10, states the following: \"secondary securement systems shall be utilized in situations that can [a]ffect safe helicopter operations, such as clipping wire.\" Quanta Services further indicated that the safety manual was for \"guidance only\" and the training of linemen for helicopter operations was the responsibility of the helicopter contractor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrevious Related Accidents&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the NTSB's accident database revealed that the operator was involved in three accidents within a 3-month period in 2018, including this accident. The first accident (ERA18LA091) occurred in San Juan, Puerto Rico on January 11, 2018, and the second accident (CEN18LA121) occurred in Blair, Wisconsin, on March 7, 2018, and involved the accident pilot. The accident in Smethport, Pennsylvania, occurred about 1 month later.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe first two accidents occurred during \"human cargo external load operations.\" For the first accident (ERA18LA091), the NTSB found that probable cause was the helicopter pilot's improper decision to use an open-end grapple, instead of an A-frame attachment, to lift and move a ladder with a lineman on it and the lineman's improper decision to be lifted on a ladder via an open-end grapple, which were contrary to company policy and the Federal Aviation Regulations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor the second accident (CEN18LA121) the NTSB determined that the probable cause was the pilot's failure to recognize and compensate for hazards during the human cargo external load operation, which led to a collision between a lineman, who was the external load, and a live power line. FAA inspectors determined the company's Rotorcraft External Load Flight Manual had inadequate procedures and training for human external cargo.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Oversight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the investigation, FAA aviation safety inspectors identified areas within the flight and maintenance departments for improvement. Inspectors visited the operator's facilities, presented a \"maintenance demonstration,\" and provided templates for documents and standard operating procedures for recordkeeping and pilot training.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a subsequent aircraft conformity inspection, an FAA aviation safety inspector (airworthiness) noted that the operator had incorporated the documents provided and that no deficiencies were noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs a result of this accident investigation, the president of High Line Helicopters mandated the installation of safety straps to wires before work begins. The safety straps are to remain in place until work is completed at each structure. - The helicopter was manufactured in 1998 and was equipped with a Rolls-Royce/Allison 250-C47 600-horsepower turboshaft engine. At the time of the accident, the helicopter's Hobbs meter indicated a total of 5,203.6 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMaintenance record excerpts showed that the helicopter's most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on February 4, 2018. The helicopter had accumulated 5,120.8 hours at that time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn FAA airworthiness inspector reviewed the helicopter's maintenance records. The inspector found numerous record-keeping errors but overall compliance with hourly and calendar inspections as well as compliance with airworthiness directives.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was installed with aluminum diamond-plate flooring, which required the removal of the left-side cabin door, and a 6061-T6 aluminum pipe. A search of the FAA's aircraft registry records and the helicopter's maintenance logbooks found no information regarding these installations. Also, no records were found showing FAA approval for these modifications or company documentation of weight and balance computations that reflected the changes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to section 2-1 of the MD 600N flight manual, operations with the left-side cabin door removed were authorized, but operations with the pilot (right) seat removed (resulting in a left-seat command configuration) were not. Neither of these modifications was reflected in the helicopter's weight and balance or aircraft records.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTitle 14 CFR 91.107(a)(3) required that all passengers be seated in an approved seat and properly secured with a seatbelt during aircraft movement. The helicopter's cabin had no passenger seats installed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeight and balance computations based on pilot and lineman weights, cargo, and three different fuel states (full, one-half, and one-third tank) showed that the helicopter, as configured, was likely within weight, lateral, and longitudinal center-of-gravity limits for the accident flight. - On April 8, 2018, about 1711 eastern daylight time, an MD Helicopters 600N helicopter, N602BP, was destroyed when it collided with a wooden power line support structure and terrain in Smethport, Pennsylvania. The commercial pilot was seriously injured, and two linemen were fatally injured. The helicopter was being operated by High Line Helicopters, Inc., as Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 133 external load flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The flight departed from an unimproved landing zone adjacent to the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree power lines, which were newly constructed in mountainous terrain and oriented approximately east/west, were supported by structures that were constructed of either wood (dual pole, H-frame) or steel (single pole). A static line was affixed to the top of the structures above the power lines. The purpose of the flight was to remove the static line from the wheeled pulley device (dolly) that temporarily secured the static line and permanently secure the static line to the structures (\"clipping wire\"). One lineman completed the task from the skid of the hovering helicopter, and another lineman inside the helicopter passed tools and equipment back and forth to the lineman on the skid.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe steps to complete the task on each support structure included wrapping the line with a spiraled wire coating (armor rod), attaching a safety strap (safety), ratcheting a chain lifting device (hoist) to the top of the structure pole, and placing the static line attachment device (shoe) to the line. Afterward, the line was hoisted into position and bolted to the structure, and the safety, hoist, and dolly were then removed from the structure and static line. The pilot then repositioned the helicopter so that the linemen could repeat the steps on the next structure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a postaccident interview, the pilot reported that he and the linemen (the crew) met earlier in the day and flew to one of the structures to assess the work and tools required to complete the task. The helicopter then returned to the landing zone and was refueled before departing on the accident flight. The crew completed one structure, and the pilot hovered the helicopter into position so that work could begin on the next structure. In a written statement, the pilot stated that the pole where the accident occurred was at \"a slight inside angle\" but was considered to be a \"safe\" area in which to work. According to the pilot and the operator, the helicopter was hovering \"inside the bite,\" which was the triangular area comprising the wire from the uphill pole, the turn at the accident pole, and the wire to the downhill pole. The \"base\" of the triangle was the horizontal line from the uphill pole to the downhill pole. The operator indicated that the \"bite\" had a vertical dimension as well.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnce the helicopter was in position, the lineman on the helicopter skid attached the first half of the armor rod ahead of the dolly and manipulated the line and the dolly to complete the wrap. According to the pilot, the lineman opened the spring-loaded locking gate on the dolly above the static line to wrap the second half of the armor rod, which was \"normal\" before the attachment of the safety. About that time, the pilot felt the helicopter being \"pulled\" toward the structure. The pilot stated that he made full right cyclic and full left pedal inputs to avoid colliding with the structure but that \"all I remember is rolling over the structure.\" The pilot said that he neither felt nor heard anything unusual before the helicopter was \"pulled\" toward the structure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness to the accident stated that, while the helicopter was hovering, its nose turned away from the pole, and the helicopter \"was violently forced back to the pole.\" The witness also stated that the tail section struck the pole and that the helicopter \"broke in two,\" after which the helicopter appeared \"to fall straight down.\" The witness did not see the helicopter's impact but stated that the engine \"continued to surge.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter descended vertically between and adjacent to the dual-pole structure. The tailboom and the six rotor blades from the main rotor separated from the helicopter during the descent. - At 1653, the weather reported at Bradford Regional Airport (BFD), Lewis Run, Pennsylvania, which was located 10 miles west of the accident site, included an overcast layer at 4,100 ft, 10 statute miles visibility, and wind from 290° at 10 knots. The temperature was -3°C, the dew point was -12°C, and the altimeter setting was 29.95 inches of mercury. - According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter. The pilot's most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued April 5, 2017. According to the operator, he had accrued about 6,200 hours of total flight experience, 250 hours of which were in the 600N helicopter. The operator estimated that that pilot had accrued 3,000 hours performing power line operations. - The NTSB deployed two unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to conduct aerial imaging of the power lines that the helicopter impacted and to map the terrain in the area in and around the power lines and supporting structures. The UAS flights were conducted 1 year after the accident; during that time, the construction work on the powerlines had been completed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA mapping flight of an exemplar MD Helicopters 600N helicopter was conducted to create a three-dimensional point cloud/surface model of the helicopter. Photogrammetry software was used to process the data and imagery from the accident scene map along with the three-dimensional model of the helicopter. The three-dimensional model was used to demonstrate the relative position of the helicopter to the tower, wires, and the dolly as well as the clearances available between the main rotor blades and the static line. - The accident site was at an elevation of about 1,600 ft. All major components were accounted for at the scene. The wreckage was contained largely at the bottom of the wooden H-frame structure that was struck, with the six rotor blades separated at the hub and scattered at various distances on the south side of the power lines. One rotor blade traveled about 300 ft down the hill (west) of the structure. The tailboom separated and was found about 70 ft west of the structure. Striating marks consistent with wire contact were visible on top of the left skid forward of the front cross-tube.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe six main rotor blades remained inside their respective pitch housings, and the laminated steel strap sets (\"strap packs\") were fractured at the hub. The blades showed varying degrees of chordwise and spanwise twisting and bending. One of the rotor blades displayed a concave dent 2.25 inches from the tip. The dent was about 1 inch wide and 0.75 inch deep. The overall dimensions of the dent and the dimensions of the individual striating marks inside it were consistent with the total dimensions of the static line and its individual strands.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe safety strap was suspended from a cross-brace of the H-frame structure, and the hoist was found next to the fuselage. Both appeared undamaged. Examination of the structure poles and the static line revealed signatures consistent with blade strikes. Blemishes on the static line, about 11 feet uphill (east) of the structure where the dolly was mounted, displayed smearing signatures consistent with a high-speed, metal-to-metal strike.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nContinuity of the flight control and drive systems was established through several breaks. The fractures and breaks all displayed features consistent with overstress. Examination of the wreckage revealed no preimpact mechanical anomalies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe dolly was in its swiveling mount and was facing 180° from its operational position. Damage signatures to the pole above the dolly's mount matched the dimensions of the dolly. The dolly was recovered from the top of the structure and was found to be intact except for the locking gate, which was fractured. The fracture surfaces displayed features consistent with overstress. The dolly was retained for further examination at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Materials Laboratory where it was compared it with an exemplar dolly. The dolly assembly consisted of a circular pulley wheel with a U-shape groove for holding a cable that was surrounded by a block with a locking gate. The locking gate latch was spring loaded to stay in the closed position (when not being actuated) against a tab on the block. The latch, when resting against the tab, would be under a bending force with the tension side facing outward face and the compression side facing inward.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the closed position, the locking gate latch would prevent the cable from leaving the groove on the pulley wheel. When the locking gate latch was actuated, it rotated inward to allow a cable to be moved either inward or outward.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the fracture surfaces on the locking gate latch with a scanning electron microscope revealed fractures consistent with overstress. The direction of the fractures on the latch remnants, and the smear marks on the pulley wheel guide outer corners, were from the pulley wheel moving outward. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot of the helicopter was conducting his third air tour flight of the day, transporting six passengers to the operator's plateau landing site, known as Quartermaster, on the south bank of the Colorado River within the Grand Canyon. He was appropriately rated for this flight and was experienced executing approaches and landings at Quartermaster. Following an uneventful flight to the area, the pilot began a descent and approach from across the river to a ravine on the west side of the landing site. The accident helicopter was the ninth of ten helicopters scheduled to land at the site that afternoon, and because all of the pads on the east side of the site were occupied, the pilot initiated a descending left turn toward a landing pad located on the west side of the site, aligning the helicopter on an east-northeasterly heading. Photographs of the landing site windsock near the time of the accident indicated winds at magnitudes of 15 kts or greater from the north-northwest, resulting in tailwind conditions during approaches to the west pads. A pilot on the ground at the landing site reported that the accident helicopter began to decelerate as it approached the landing pads and entered a nose-up attitude, then turned left toward the landing pads, transitioned through several pitch oscillations, and drifted aft. The left turn continued through 720° of rotation before the helicopter descended into a canyon just west of the landing pads and impacted terrain. Photos indicated that the helicopter’s final impact in the canyon was immediately followed by a postcrash fire. Postaccident examination of the helicopter and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nTwo pilots who landed just before the accident conducted their approaches in a similar direction as the accident pilot and both later reported that they encountered adverse wind. The pilot who landed just before the accident reported that he encountered wind conditions that necessitated full right pedal and nearly resulted in a loss of yaw control. The accident helicopter’s flight characteristics at the time of the accident would have included slowing airspeed, a high power setting, and a relative wind position that were all conducive to a loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE), thus it is likely that the loss of control was the direct result of LTE. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing site was located on a plateau and provided limited approach options due to its local topography. At the time of the accident, potential demarcation lines (boundaries of updrafts and downdrafts) would have been on the pinnacles of ridges located along the approach to the Quartermaster west pads. Figure 8 shows a conceptual illustration of potential demarcation lines and wind directions based on the terrain and wind environment present around the accident site at the accident time, and suggests areas where downdrafts, updrafts and turbulence could have impacted the accident flight’s approach to the landing site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 8. Conceptual display of demarcation lines at accident site&#x0D;\nThe proximity of other pilots and passengers who witnessed the accident resulted in an immediate response to aid the occupants of the helicopter; however, the remote location of the accident site and communication difficulties between on-scene and outside resources made rescue coordination challenging and victim transport by helicopter to the hospital did not begin until about 6 hours after the accident. Although all seven occupants survived the impact, they all sustained significant burn injuries, and three of the occupants were likely unable to egress the helicopter. The most significant factor affecting occupant survival was the immediate postcrash fire. The accident helicopter was not equipped, nor was it required to be equipped, with a crash-resistant fuel system. Due to a lack of data regarding the crash dynamics and impact forces, the effectiveness of such a system, if installed, in delaying the onset of a postcrash fire could not be determined.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe only source of local wind information at Quartermaster at the time of the accident was a windsock, which can only display wind speeds up to 15 kts. Further, windsocks cannot indicate the presence of downdrafts, turbulence, or any other local environmental conditions that may affect flight safety, particularly when landing in a confined area. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator provided its pilots with a morning weather briefing on the day of the accident, which advised of gusty wind conditions in the area of the accident site forecast to increase throughout the afternoon. Weather advisories issued after the morning weather briefing, several hours before the accident, indicated a cold front proceeding through the area of the accident site with associated wind gusts and turbulence. This information was likely not captured by the operator and distributed to its pilots even though some of the forecasts included wind conditions above the maximum wind outlined in the company's general operations manual (GOM). Because there was no additional wind information at the landing site beyond the windsock, it could not be determined the actual wind conditions at the landing site at the time of the accident; however, pilots who landed before the accident pilot estimated the wind to be 15 to 20 knots, which is below that specified in the GOM. Although the morning briefing was not intended to be the pilots' sole source of weather information, it was likely the primary weather information the accident pilot received before the accident, as he had recently flown to Quartermaster and is not likely to have rechecked the weather. &#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 10, 2018, about 1719 mountain standard time (mst), an Airbus Helicopters EC130 B4 helicopter, N155GC, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Peach Springs, Arizona. The pilot and one passenger sustained serious injuries, and five passengers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 136 air tour flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the day of the accident, the pilot performed a canyon landing, and an air tour flight before the accident flight. All of the day's flights departed Boulder City Municipal Airport (BVU), Boulder City, Nevada. Both the second flight and the accident flight had a destination of Quartermaster, an unimproved landing site regularly used by the operator within the Grand Canyon's Quartermaster Canyon. The pilot's second flight of the day took place in the early afternoon and returned at 1455. The accident flight departed at 1642. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter reached the Hoover Dam about 1652 and entered the Grand Canyon West Special Flight Rules Area 50-2 about 1713, where the pilot flew the standard helicopter route known as the “Green 4 route.” The last radar return was captured at 1717 and depicted the helicopter about 3.5 nautical miles (nm) west of the accident site, consistent with a descent into the canyon to Quartermaster. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter was one of ten helicopters scheduled to land at the site on the afternoon of the accident. The tour operation intended for the ten helicopters to sequentially land at Quartermaster and allowed for them all to be present at the landing site at the same time. The accident pilot stated that, during the approach to Quartermaster, he noted that the eight helicopters that had already landed were facing in different directions, indicating variable wind conditions. The combination of the windsock direction, orientations of the parked helicopters, and unoccupied landing pads on the west side of the landing area prompted the pilot to conduct an approach from the west and touch down on one of the west landing pads. He recalled that the two helicopters that landed immediately before him were on the west landing pads facing east, the same as his chosen approach direction, and noted that the windsock indicated wind from the north/northeast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that he normally remained on the north side of the Colorado River, crossing the river between 200 and 300 ft above ground level (agl) while approaching Quartermaster for landing. After crossing the river, he entered a left turning descent toward the landing area. (See figure 1.) He stated that, as he made the left turn, the helicopter encountered what he described as a “violent gust of wind” and began to spin, and as a result he was unable to maintain directional control. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Graphical representation of typical approach to west pads &#x0D;\nA Papillon pilot on the ground at Quartermaster watched the accident helicopter as it approached from across the river and assumed that the pilot planned to land on the west pads based on his approach path. He reported that the helicopter decelerated and then entered an approximate 15° nose-up pitch attitude. While maintaining altitude, the helicopter began a left turn toward the landing site. According to the witness, during the turn, the helicopter transitioned into a level attitude, followed by a nose-low attitude. He further reported that the helicopter began to drift aft as the left turn continued and returned to a level attitude before it rotated 360° and began a descent. After a second 360° rotation, the helicopter collided with terrain. A postimpact fire ensued.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrevious Approach and Landings at Quartermaster&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe first five helicopters to land at Quartermaster on the afternoon of the accident approached from the east and landed on the east pads, facing west. The next three helicopters landed on the west pads and used a similar approach as the accident helicopter. The tenth helicopter did not land due to the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot began his employment as a full-time pilot with Papillon Airways on June 3, 2013 and was trained by Papillon in the accident helicopter make and model. In 2014, the pilot transitioned into a role as a part-time pilot to pursue another career opportunity. At the time of the accident, the pilot’s primary occupation was in a different field (not as a pilot), but he continued flying for Papillon in a part-time capacity. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCompany training records revealed that the pilot’s most recent line check in accordance with 14 CFR Part 135 was accomplished in December 2017 and showed satisfactory grades for all areas of the examination; however, the lead pilot who conducted a portion of the pilot’s training in preparation for this line check reported that he had marked the pilot’s performance “unsatisfactory.” Specifically, he noted that the pilot had experienced difficulty maneuvering the helicopter during high wind conditions and did not have enough altitude as he turned during 180° autorotations. The pilot passed his check ride with another lead pilot 1-2 days later.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, at the time of the accident, the pilot had flown passengers into the Grand Canyon for them a total of 836 times, with 581 landings at Quartermaster. The pilot stated that he felt comfortable flying the Airbus Helicopters (formerly Eurocopter) EC130 B4 helicopter and landing at Quartermaster. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrior to becoming an air tour pilot for Papillon, the pilot flew air tours in non-turbine powered helicopters in the Midwestern United States.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHELICOPTER INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel System Crash Resistance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn October 3, 1994, the FAA introduced improved fuel system crash resistance standards for newly-certified normal category helicopters. These standards, outlined in 14 CFR 27.952, are intended to minimize fuel spillage near ignition sources to improve the evacuation time needed for crew and passengers to escape a postcrash fire; however, they were not retroactively applicable to either existing helicopters or newly-manufactured helicopters whose certification and approval predated the revised standards. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter, manufactured in 2010, was not equipped, nor was it required to be equipped, with a fuel system meeting the contemporary fuel system crash resistance standards. An option to retrofit the EC130 B4 with a crash-resistant fuel system was approved by the FAA in December 2017. According to the operator, the retrofit kits were not available to them until April 2018, after which they completed a retrofit of their existing fleet of EC130 B4 and AS350-series helicopters by August 2018. Airbus Helicopters issued Safety Information Notice 3281-S-28 on November 5, 2018, which recommended that operators of the EC-130 and AS350 helicopters retrofit them with 14 CFR 27.852 compliant crash resistance fuel systems. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn July 2015, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendation A-15-12, which recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) require the implementation of crash-resistant fuel system airworthiness standards for all newly manufactured rotorcraft, regardless of the original certification date, to reduce the risk of a postcrash fire in survivable accidents involving these rotorcraft. Section 317 of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 prohibits helicopters manufactured after April 5, 2020, from flying in US airspace unless certified with a crash-resistant fuel system. Pending further information on the FAA’s efforts to address this issue with rulemaking, the NTSB had classified A-15-12 as “Open – Acceptable Response.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSurface Observations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe automated observation at Grand Canyon West Airport (1G4), located at an elevation of 4,816 ft mean sea level (msl) about 2.6 nm northwest of the accident site, recorded wind from 330° at 15 knots (kts) with gusts to 19 kts at 1705. At 1725, the station recorded wind from 330° at 16 kts with gusts to 22 kts. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPapillon and another helicopter operator each owned a weather station about 2 miles north-northwest of the accident site, at elevations about 1,200 ft msl. At 1700, the Papillon station reported wind from the north-northwest at 11 kts; at 1710, the wind was from the north-northwest at 11 kts gusting to 19 kts. At 1720, the wind was from the north at 11 kts, and at 1730, the wind was from the north-northwest at 12 kts, gusting to 24 kts. (The wind was recorded in miles per hour; the data has been converted to kts in this report.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe other station recorded a north-northwest wind at 10 kts gusting to 19 kts at 1700. The following three observations, recorded at 10-minute intervals, indicated northwest/north-northwest wind at 10 to 11 kts. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nQuartermaster was equipped with a windsock that was located near the landing pads. A photo of the windsock taken about 1713 showed the windsock in its fully extended position, consistent with a wind velocity of 15 kts or greater. (See figure 2.) &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Photograph taken at 1713 MST of windsock at Quartermaster&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPapillion Pilots’ Recollections of Wind Conditions at Quartermaster&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne pilot, who entered the canyon about 1646 and landed second in the sequence, encountered what he estimated to be a 20-kt headwind from the west while approaching an east pad. Another pilot, who entered the canyon about 1704 and landed fifth in the sequence, reported a northwest wind while landing on an east pad. He reported that he warned other pilots over the company radio frequency of a tailwind during the approach; however, only the sixth pilot to land recalled hearing this transmission. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot of the sixth helicopter to land, who entered the canyon about 1708, estimated variable winds between 15 and 20 kts. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe seventh pilot to land entered the canyon at 1709. During his approach to the west pads, his intended destination, he recalled that the helicopter's tail swung rapidly due to strong winds and he applied significant right pedal and crabbed the helicopter to maintain the approach. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe last helicopter to land before the accident entered the canyon at 1710 and touched down about 2 minutes before the accident occurred. The pilot had experience flying in mountainous terrain, knew of the presence of 15-20 kt winds from the east, and thus anticipated windshear during the approach. While turning toward the west pads, he experienced a strong wind that swung the nose of the helicopter about 90° to the left. The airspeed rapidly decayed and it required all of his effort to maintain control of the helicopter. As the helicopter began to descend, he increased collective to arrest the descent and was able to maintain control by pushing the cyclic forward and right to increase airspeed while applying full right pedal to keep the nose straight. He successfully landed the helicopter on one of the west pads.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident pilot reported that he tried to be conscious of the wind during previous flights into Quartermaster and added that he had never experienced a violent wind shift like the one he encountered on the day of the accident. When discussing making the final turn to approach into Quartermaster, the accident pilot stated that “ninety percent of days are…it’s calm and you don’t think twice.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather Synopsis &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA National Weather Service (NWS) Surface Analysis Chart for 1400 showed a low-pressure center along the Utah/New Mexico Border. A cold front extended west from this low-pressure center, and the accident site was located just ahead of the front. In a subsequent Surface Analysis Chart issued at 1700, the cold front had moved south of the accident site into north-central Arizona. Clear skies were reported across the region except in far northern Arizona and southern Utah, which indicated overcast sky conditions.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NWS sustained wind speeds for the accident region showed forecasts for increasing wind speeds throughout the day. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUpper Air Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA high-resolution rapid refresh model sounding valid for the accident location at 1700 was retrieved from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Air Resources Laboratory. The surface elevation of this model was run at 1,863 ft, about 400 ft higher than the terrain elevation of Quartermaster. The model showed wind from the north-northwest at speeds between 10 kts near the surface to about 20 kts near about 5,000 ft. Sounding calculations showed low-level wind shear near the surface. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather Forecasts&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn Area Forecast Discussion (AFD) issued at 1637 reported a strong cold front and widespread wind gusts during the evening on the day of the accident. A previous AFD forecast a strong cold front to move through the region that afternoon and evening, with winds from the north to northeast at sustained magnitudes from 20-30 kts and gusts between 40-50 kts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn urgent Weather Message was issued by the NWS at 1008 effective for the accident site at 1800. The Weather Message referenced an NWS wind advisory, which indicated that wind would increase in the late afternoon, peak overnight, and decrease through the following morning. The wind was forecast to be 20-30 mph sustained with gusts of 30-45 mph and possible isolated gusts to 55 mph.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Graphical Forecast for Aviation was issued about 1500 and valid for 1700 that depicted clear sky conditions, a surface visibility of greater than 5 statute miles, and northwesterly surface wind gusts between 20 and 35 kts in the accident region. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest Center Weather Service Unit issued a Meteorological Impact Statement at 1545 to expect gusty westerly wind of 25 to 35 kts gusting to 40 to 45 kts over the mountains and deserts on the afternoon and evening of the accident in the area of the accident site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOperator’s Weather Procedures &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Papillon’s General Operations Manual (GOM), “For flights conducted within the Local Tour Area, the Director of Operations (DO), Chief Pilot, Director of Utility Operations, or a Management Designee will determine the weather based on information obtained from an approved source.” Further, the GOM stated that pilot weather briefings are conducted as part of a daily morning safety briefing and the weather information would be posted on the bulletin board of the pilot break room. These briefings must include adverse weather advisories (SIGMET/AIRMET), current weather (METARs), terminal forecasts (TAF), area forecast, winds and temperatures, pilot reports and NOTAMS, if applicable. According to the DO, the morning briefings were conducted by a lead pilot and occurred about 0545. The accident pilot’s shift started about 4 hours after the morning weather briefing; however, he initialed the briefing sheet to indicate that he had reviewed the provided weather information.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator’s daily weather briefing was a company-produced document that included current weather conditions, TAFs, area forecasts, NOTAMs, and AIRMETS/SIGMETS/PIREPS/TFRs. The briefing sheet for the day of the accident showed wind at 7 knots at 1G4. The area forecast portion of the briefing sheet included a synopsis that gusty winds from the north would spread southward and would be accompanied by a cold front but did not offer any further wind information. The briefing sheet also presented three NOTAMs, two AIRMETs, and the TAF for McCarran International Airport (LAS), Las Vegas, Nevada, which did not show any forecast weather events or wind conditions for Quartermaster.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn addition to the weather briefing, the operator had a pilot’s station in the passenger building where pilots could access additional weather information, and their lead pilot monitored PIREPs and aviation weather data throughout the day. The company’s control tower staff could also relay weather information to the lead pilot, although this was not a required part of their duties. Interviews with several Papillon pilots revealed that the primary means of assessing the weather conditions before a flight included reports from pilots returning from the Grand Canyon and wind indicators near Quartermaster, the windsock at Quartermaster, and a weather station about 2 nm away. Several pilots stated that they would talk to other pilots at the terminal after returning from Quartermaster to advise them about the current wind conditions. The more senior pilots stated that they would make radio transmissions regarding the wind if they found it particularly surprising or challenging. One pilot stated they were cautious of making more radio transmissions than necessary to avoid frequency congestion given that other companies also operated in the area. The operator did not require its pilots to communicate wind information over the radio, but did discourage unnecessary radio communication and encouraged pilots to report “safety of flight” matters such as pilot reports on the company radio frequency. Multiple Papillon pilots stated that the winds at Quartermaster were unpredictable and that the wind direction could drastically change during an approach into the landing site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident pilot was unable to recount how he assessed the weather conditions on the day of the accident, but described how he normally obtained weather information before a flight. He stated that he would not recheck the weather between tour flights into the Grand Canyon because there was only a short turnover between flights and because he had recently been to the destination. He stated that pilots returning from Quartermaster would relay wind information when they arrived back at the terminal. Upon arriving at Quartermaster, the pilot would typically use a nearby windsock, Quartermaster’s windsock, and the directions of parked helicopters to discern the direction of the wind. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAPPROACH AND LANDING SITE INFORMATION\t&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nQuartermaster Elevation and Topography&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nQuartermaster was a landing site located on the south side of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, about 53 nm east of BVU. The site was in an arid region on a plateau approximately 3,300 ft below the rim of the Grand Canyon at an elevation of 1,450 ft msl. Quartermaster’s 600-ft-long by 150-ft-wide landing area comprised packed dirt/rock and loose rock, with sparse, low vegetation. A March 2017 written agreement between the Hualapai Sovereign Nation and Papillon authorized Papillon to use the 10 available landing pads and defined the number of landings allotted per year. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTitle 14 CFR Part 95.15 used the geographic coordinated system to define sections of the Western United States as “mountainous areas.” The coordinates referenced in the regulation included the Grand Canyon under this definition.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Papillon, the number of passengers the company flew into Quartermaster increased annually from 11,305 in 1999 (2 years after they started offering air tours to Quartermaster) to 77,742 total passengers the year before the accident. From the start of the operator’s service into Quartermaster to 2017, they had flown 1,028,623 passengers into Quartermaster, landing 179.661 times without any accidents. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator did not issue any written guidance to its pilots regarding specific approaches, approach profiles, or landing pads to use under certain conditions. According to the operator’s chief pilot, they were unable to predict which pad/approach would be favorable. He noted that their pilots were trained to conduct approaches into the wind, but were also professional pilots who, under 14 CFR 91.3, are directly responsible for and are the final authority as to the conduct of the flight.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPapillon pilots typically used two main approaches into Quartermaster; the \"downriver landing\" (used when landing on the east pads) and the \"upriver landing\" (used when landing on the west pads). According to the operator, these approaches were established by pilots and management when they began service into Quartermaster in 1997. Both approaches began from the north side of the Colorado River. The downriver landing required the pilot to cross the river west of Quartermaster and overfly a saddle-shaped landmark referred to as the “notch,” located south of the landing site. The pilot then performed a descending left turn to the east side of Quartermaster, touching down facing west-northwest.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nQuartermaster is part of the Hualapai Sovereign Nation and its use is controlled through an agreement with the operator. The agreement prohibits the fixed marking of any touchdown and lift off zones, or any fixed means for delineating preferred landing pads or maneuvering areas. Landing pads were selected by each pilot upon arrival based on availability and wind direction. The first pilots to arrive in a group typically landed on the pads closest to the center of the landing area. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest upright in rocky terrain about 300 ft below the landing site on a heading of 222° magnetic. Most of the wreckage was consumed by the postcrash fire except for the tail boom and fenestron, which had separated from but were collocated with the fuselage. (See figure 3.) The engine, still attached to the engine deck, was found in the main wreckage and sustained fire damage. All three main rotor blades remained attached to the main rotor hub and exhibited damage consistent with high rotational energy. The tail stinger, fenestron hub cover, a toe from a skid step, and small pieces of transparent windshield were found on a canyon slope east of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Photograph of accident site&#x0D;\nAirframe Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nContinuity of the flight control system and main rotor drive system could not be determined due to postimpact fire damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fenestron remained attached to the tail boom, which was found adjacent to the cockpit. Circular impact signatures were observed on the tail rotor drive shaft cover, consistent with the tail rotor drive shaft rotating at impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll three main rotor blades were found at the main wreckage site and remained attached to their root ends at their respective main rotor blade sleeves, which were attached to the Starflex. All three pitch horns remained attached to their respective sleeves and all three Starflex arms were fractured. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll three main rotor servo controls remained installed. Two of the three pitch change links were found in their normal positions attached to their respective pitch horns and rotating swashplate attachment points, but their link body was fractured. A portion of the third pitch change link body was found near its normally-installed location. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fenestron control cable was fractured near the tail boom separation. Continuity of the control cable was traced from a fracture at its forward end to the fenestron blades. The fracture surface exhibited signatures consistent with overstress failure. A forward portion of the fenestron control cable was observed in the main wreckage; however, control continuity could not be established due to thermal damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMost of the fenestron blades remained attached to the hub, with the exception of one blade, which was fractured at its root; the blade was found on the ground immediately below the fenestron. The fenestron drive shaft did not exhibit anomalous damage and the external splines on the forward end of the drive shaft did not exhibit any anomalous wear. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the reduction gearbox revealed signatures consistent with engine operation at the time of impact. The power turbine blades did not display evidence of blade shedding and the magnetic plugs showed no evidence of debris. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology tests performed by the FAA's Forensic Sciences Laboratory on specimens from the pilot were negative for all tested-for drugs except those used during medical treatment following the accident.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSURVIVAL ASPECTS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeats&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with 8 single-occupant energy attenuating seats manufactured by Zodiac Seats, designed and certified to the standards contained in EASA ETSO C127a. (See figure 4.) All of the seats were destroyed by postcrash fire. Each of the eight seats was equipped with a 4-point rotary buckle restraint, all of which were recovered from the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4: Accident Helicopter Seat Configuration&#x0D;\nThe fire extinguisher was normally stowed in a bracket on the floor between the pilot seat and passenger seat No. 1. The fire extinguisher was charred and found in the wreckage. Seat no. 1 was unoccupied.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInjuries&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPassengers in seat Nos. 2, 6, and 7 did not have either the ability or opportunity to evacuate and died due to burns and smoke inhalation injuries; no blunt force traumatic injuries were noted by the medical examiner. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot and passengers in seat Nos. 3, 4, and 5 sustained serious thermal injuries. Passengers in seat Nos. 3 and 4 succumbed to their burn injuries several days after the accident. In addition to their thermal injuries, the passenger in seat No. 5 sustained a spinal fracture. The pilot sustained an open left leg fracture. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEmergency Response&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA photograph of the accident site taken at 1718:49 (after the accident) by a witness in an inbound helicopter showed white smoke and/or dust in the area of the accident site, while a second photograph taken about 7 seconds later showed flames and black smoke. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNumerous individuals, including pilots and passengers from other helicopters, were at Quartermaster at the time of the accident. Several Papillon pilots and members of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) retrieved first aid kits from other helicopters and responded to the accident site, arriving about 20 minutes after the accident. They observed the burning helicopter and the pilot and three seriously injured passengers who were outside the helicopter. (See figure 5.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5. Quartermaster landing zone, accident site, and extraction location &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an Artex C406-N HM emergency locator transmitter (ELT), which transmitted an alert notification and location information to the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) at 1719:42. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe location of the accident site posed significant challenges and extended the response time for emergency personnel, who had to be flown in by helicopter. (See figure 6.) These first responders reached the accident site about 45 minutes after the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 6. The location and terrain elevation difference between first responders at Grand Canyon West Airport and Quartermaster&#x0D;\nThe seriously injured occupants were eventually extracted from the accident site via helicopter between 2315 and 0105 arriving at University Medical Center in Las Vegas between 0055 and 0128. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSome Papillon pilots noted that the use of satellite phones stored at Quartermaster was hindered due to dead batteries, poor coverage, and a lack of training in their operation. Papillon provided a laminated instruction card about use of the phones in their cases and stated that the phones were regularly tested. Additionally, Papillon stated there were spare batteries in the cases and the batteries were regularly replaced. Billing records confirmed the Quartermaster satellite phone was used in April, May, July and December 2017, and on the night of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the operator did not have a program in place to ensure that the satellite phones were regularly maintained, and staff were trained on their use. After the accident, the operator purchased new satellite phones with improved coverage, easier operability, and spare batteries. Papillon pilots were trained in their use and asked to demonstrate their proficiency in using the satellite phones. Additionally, Papillon purchased trauma kits and a collapsible stretcher that are now located in unlocked metal containers, readily available for emergency crews. Finally, Papillon provided its pilots with first aid training and developed procedures to inspect the emergency medical equipment quarterly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLoss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness (LTE)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA Advisory Circular 90-95, &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n“LTE is a critical, low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic which can result in an uncommanded rapid yaw rate, which does not subside of its own accord and, if not corrected, can result in a loss of aircraft control.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInformation on this subject has been published by many organizations including the FAA and helicopter manufacturers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21B) contains an in-depth discussion on LTE. Chapter 7, Helicopter Performance, addresses helicopters with main rotors that rotate counter-clockwise, and states: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n“The wind direction is also an important consideration. Headwinds are the most desirable as they contribute to the greatest increase in performance. Strong crosswinds and tailwind may require the use of more tail rotor thrust to maintain directional control. This increased tail rotor thrust absorbs power from the engine, which means there is less power available to the main rotor for the production of lift. Some helicopters even have a critical wind azimuth or maximum safe relative wind chart. Operating the helicopter beyond these limits could cause a loss of tail rotor effectiveness.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nChapter 11, Helicopter Emergencies and Hazards, defines LTE as a condition that occurs when the flow of air through a tail rotor is altered in some way, by altering the angle or speed at which the air passes through the rotating blades of the tail rotor disk. It further states…&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main factors contributing to LTE are: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirflow and downdraft generated by the main rotor blades interfering with the airflow entering the tail rotor assembly. &#x0D;\nMain blade vortices developed at the main blade tips entering the tail rotor disk. &#x0D;\nTurbulence and other natural phenomena affecting the airflow surrounding the tail rotor. &#x0D;\nA high-power setting, hence large main rotor blade pitch angle, induces considerable main rotor downwash and hence more turbulence than when the helicopter is in a low power condition&#x0D;\nA slow forward airspeed, typically at speeds where translational lift and translational thrust are in the process of change and airflow around the tail rotor will vary in direction and speed. &#x0D;\nThe airflow relative to the helicopter;&#x0D;\nWorst case – relative wind within ± 15° of the 10 o'clock position, generating vortices that can blow directly into the tail rotor. This is dictated by the characteristics of the helicopter's aerodynamics of tailboom position, tail rotor size and position relative to the main rotor and vertical stabilizer size and shape. &#x0D;\nWeathercock stability – tailwinds from 120° to 240°, such as left crosswinds, causing high pilot workload. &#x0D;\nTail rotor vortex ring state (210° to 330°). Winds within this region will result in the development of the vortex ring state of the tail rotor. &#x0D;\nCombinations of (a, b, c) of these factors in a particular situation can easily require more antitorque than the helicopter can generate and in a particular environment LTE can be the result. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n…There are a number of contributing factors, but what is more important in preventing LTE is to note them, and then to associate them with situations that should be avoided. Whenever possible, pilots should learn to avoid the following combinations: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLow and slow out of ground effect. &#x0D;\nWinds from ±15° of the 10 o'clock position and probably on around to 5 o'clock position&#x0D;\nTailwinds that may alter the onset of translational lift and translational thrust, and hence induce high power demands and demand more antitorque than the tail rotor can produce. &#x0D;\nLow speed downwind turns.&#x0D;\nLarge changes of power at low airspeeds.&#x0D;\nLow speed flight in the proximity of physical obstructions that may alter a smooth airflow to both the main rotor and tail rotor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Eurocopter service letter no. 1673-67-04, published on February 4, 2005, several instances of a loss of yaw axis control occurred when “the [pilot’s] action applied to the [right] yaw pedal was not enough (amplitude/duration) to stop [left] rotation as quickly as the pilot wished.” In this situation, as the aircraft continues to rotate, the pilot may suspect a tail rotor failure and either climb or descend, which, respectively, can increase the leftward rotation, or cause the aircraft to tilt while rotating and subsequently contact the ground. In the cases mentioned, “given their altitude and weight conditions the tail rotors were far from their maximum performance limits.” &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Eurocopter service letter addresses helicopters with main rotors that rotate clockwise, though loss of yaw control can occur with any helicopter with a tail rotor. A loss of yaw axis control can also occur when the helicopter is in fact operated beyond its performance limits (due to loading or environmental conditions or extreme maneuvers), and in this case even the prompt application full right pedal might not be sufficient to counter a left rotation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEurocopter service letter no. 1673-67-04 was superseded by Safety Information Notice 3297-S-00, issued by the manufacturer on July 3, 2019, that discussed the detection and recommended response to unanticipated yaw, emphasizing a prompt reaction with large amplitude of opposite pedal input. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngineering Simulations of Accident Flight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs there was no recorded data available from the accident flight, the helicopter manufacturer performed engineering simulations with parametric data from an exemplar flight to compute the control authority required to match a route similar to the accident flight in various wind conditions. The results of these simulations are included in the public docket for this accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLanding Site Research&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTitle 14 CFR 136.1, National Air Tour Safety Standards, Applicability and Definitions, defined \"suitable landing area\" as: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nan area that provides the operator reasonable capability to land without damage to equipment or injury to persons. Suitable landing areas must be site-specific, designated by the operator, and accepted by the FAA. These site-specific areas would provide an emergency landing area for a single-engine helicopter or a multi-engine helicopter that does not have the capability to reach a safe landing area after an engine power loss.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA certificate of authorization (COA) dated March 28, 1997, from the FAA to Papillon showed that Quartermaster was recognized as a landing site for Papillon’s air tour service with the provision that Papillon obtain permission from the land owner for any non-emergency landings. At the time of the accident, Papillon had an active agreement with the Hualapai Nation to land air tours at the site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDemarcation Line&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the United States Army Flight Manual “Fundamentals of Flight,” &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe demarcation line is the point separating upflow air from downflow air. It forms at the mountain’s highest point and extends diagonally upward. The velocity of the wind and steepness of the uplift slope determines the position of the demarcation line. Generally, the higher the wind speed and steeper the terrain, the steeper the demarcation line…As wind increases above 20 kts, the demarcation line moves forward to the crest’s leading edge. It then matches the slope’s steepness. The severity of updrafts, downdrafts, and turbulence also increase. Under these conditions, the best landing spot is close to the forward edge (windward side) of the terrain feature. (See figure 7.) &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 7: Excerpt showing demarcation line in strong wind from United States Army Helicopter Manual&#x0D;\nA training document authored by The European Helicopter Safety Team entitled, “Techniques for Helicopter Operations in Hilly and Mountainous Terrain” stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n…if the ground rises, the wind flows upward on a slope and it is referred to as the ‘windward’ side. If the ground slopes away from the wind direction, the wind flows downward and is referred to as the \"leeward\" side…When it flows over a cliff it tends to tumble over the edge in a turbulent manner.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe document further stated that,&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the leeward slope there is generally turbulence and downdrafts that can make flight hazardous and should be avoided. The area where the updraft turns to a downdraft is referred to the as \"demarcation line.\" The demarcation line between updrafting and downdrafting air will, typically, become steeper and move towards the windward edge of the feature as wind speed increases.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMechanical Turbulence&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPapillon pilots remarked that the terrain features in the canyon adjacent to Quartermaster created mechanical turbulence, a weather phenomenon defined as the disturbance and transformation from horizontal wind to a complicated pattern of eddies and irregular air movements due to obstructions such as bluffs, hills, mountains or buildings. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPinnacle and Ridgeline Operations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21B), &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA pinnacle is an area from which the surface drops away steeply on all sides. A ridgeline is a long area from which the surface drops away steeply on one or two sides, such as a bluff or precipice. The absence of obstacles does not necessarily decrease the difficulty of pinnacle or ridgeline operations. Updrafts, downdrafts, and turbulence together with unsuitable terrain in which to make a forced landing may still present extreme hazards.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPapillon Terrain Flight Training and Guidance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen asked how they trained their pilots in mountainous flight operations, the company’s Director of Operations stated that “all of our pilots come to us as commercially rated pilots proficient in these maneuvers and certified to competency by the FAA in rotorcraft.” In addition, the operator required a minimum of 1,000 hours of pilot-in-command helicopter time before their employment. Each pilot was trained and evaluated in specific areas that aligned with concepts covered in the Helicopter Flying Handbook to prepare them for passenger flights in the Grand Canyon, including approaches, pinnacle/rooftop operations, confined area/steep approaches, crosswind operations, and loss of lift at altitude (settling with power). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company used a “Flight Training Flow” as a guide for initial training in the EC130 B4 helicopter. According to this document, pinnacle and confined space operations are two of eight topics covered as part of a 1.3-hour instructional flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe “Pinnacle/Rooftop Operations” section of the company’s training program stated that “the trainee shall accomplish a proper high and low reconnaissance.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCompany guidance regarding approach and landing near pinnacles and ridgelines included excerpts from the FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIf there is a need to climb to a pinnacle or ridgeline, do it on the upwind side, when practicable, to take advantage of any updrafts. The approach flightpath should be parallel to the ridgeline and into the wind as much as possible. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLoad, altitude, wind conditions, and terrain features determine the angle to use in the final part of the approach. As a general rule, the greater the winds are, the steeper the approach needs to be to avoid turbulent air and downdrafts…if a crosswind exists, remain clear of down-drafts on the leeward or downwind side of the ridgeline…When making an approach to a pinnacle, avoid leeward turbulence and keep the helicopter within reach of a forced landing area as long as possible.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nConfined Area/Steep Approaches&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the “Confined Area Operations” section of the company’s training program, a high angle of descent should be used to complete a steep approach into the wind. Among the expectations listed under “Acceptable Performance Guidelines,” the company expected the trainee to consider wind conditions, landing surface, obstacles, and to remain aware of the possibility of wind shear and/or wake turbulence. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNormal Approach to a Hover&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company’s training program described a normal approach to a hover as its “accepted way to transition from cruising flight to a hover.” The maneuver required a descent from 300 to 500 ft agl on a constant angle descent and constant airspeed until the helicopter is about 75 ft agl. The section continued by describing the maneuver in detail and incorporated the pilot’s control movements. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAmong the expectations listed under “Acceptable Performance Guidelines,” the company expected the trainee to consider wind conditions, landing surface, obstacles, and to remain aware of the possibility of wind shear and/or wake turbulence. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCrosswind Operations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company training on crosswind operations was meant to establish proficiency in approaches and landings when operations into the wind were not feasible. Most of the section discussed crosswind take-offs, as the section description makes only two references to a crosswind approach. The first reference stated that a “crosswind departure and approach in helicopter are similar to the operation in fixed wing.” The second reference was captured in the “Acceptable Performance Guidelines” section, which stated “in addition to guidelines established for no wind approaches, all crosswind work will be evaluated on the basis of maintaining proper ground track.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company operations manual imposed maximum wind limitations of 30-35 kts steady wind and a gust spread of 20 kts or greater; these limitations applied to both on- and off- airport operations. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident Safety Actions&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the accident, Papillon took the following safety actions.&#x0D;\nCompleted a crash resistant fuel system retrofit of its entire fleet of Airbus EC130 B4 and AS350B3e helicopters in August 2019 &#x0D;\nPurchased survival equipment and trauma kits for each of its remote landing sites, including Quartermaster&#x0D;\nInstalled an additional windsock near the accident site along with a weather station that transmits real-time wind information to Papillon’s base of operations&#x0D;\nNew satellite phones were placed at Quartermaster and other landing sites that include spare batteries. Pilots were trained on their usage.&#x0D;\nUpgraded their Spidetracks program, a GPS tracking platform, from a sampling rate of 15 minute intervals to 15 second intervals. &#x0D;\nTrained 12 employees as emergency response instructors to develop a module for employee training.&#x0D;\nExpanded the existing LTE training module in pilot training syllabus.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the accident, Airbus took the following safety action.&#x0D;\nThe company’s existing safety information notice on unanticipated left yaw (LTE) was revised on July 3, 2019.&#x0D;\nSafety information notice 3539-I-00 was released on September 4, 2020), which addresses the controllability differences between a conventional tail rotor and a Fenestron, which the accident helicopter was equipped with.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The private pilot of the helicopter departed with three passengers on a cross-country flight in day visual meteorological conditions. Surveillance video of the takeoff showed that the helicopter assumed a nose-low attitude upon lifting off the ground and mostly maintained that attitude throughout the takeoff and initial climb. Radar data indicated that the helicopter reached a maximum altitude of 500 ft mean sea level before it entered a rapid descent and impacted homes and the ground less than 1 mile from the departure airport. The surviving passenger described the descent as \"straight down.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of the airframe, engine, and related systems revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Weight and balance calculations revealed that the helicopter was operating 76 lbs over its published maximum gross weight and near the published forward center of gravity (CG) limits. The helicopter's observed nose-low attitude throughout the flight is consistent with a forward CG, which would have required additional aft cyclic control inputs to maintain level flight and may have resulted in reduced cyclic control travel. The passenger stated that the pilot did not ask any of the passengers for their weights, nor did he instruct them where to sit, suggesting that the pilot did not perform weight and balance calculations before the flight. Given the lack of mechanical anomalies, it is likely that the pilot experienced a loss of helicopter control due to his decision to operate the helicopter outside of its published weight and balance limitations.",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to the FAA's Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21B), Chapter 6, Weight and Balance:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeight limits are necessary to guarantee the structural integrity of the helicopter, enable pilots to predict helicopter performance and insure aircraft controllability.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHelicopter performance is not only affected by gross weight, but also by the position of that weight. It is essential to load the aircraft within the allowable CG range specified in the rotorcraft flight manual's (RFM) weight and balance limitations. Loading outside approved limits can result in insufficient control travel for safe operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot should ensure that the helicopter is properly balanced within its center of gravity limitations, so that minimal cyclic input is required during hovering flight, except for any wind corrections. Since the fuselage acts as a pendulum suspended from the rotor, changing the CG changes the angle at which the aircraft hangs from the rotor…if the CG is too far forward of the mast, the helicopter hangs with its nose tilted down… - The accident helicopter was a Robinson Helicopter R44, serial number 1295, and was powered by a 235-horsepower Lycoming O-540-F1B5 engine, serial number L-25375-40A. The most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on December 7, 2017, at a Hobbs time of 568.6 hours and an airframe total time of 6,966.3 hours. The most recent annual inspection was completed on June 1, 2017, at a Hobbs time of 383.9 hours, airframe total time of 6,781.6 hours, and engine time since major overhaul of 383.9 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to representatives from a fixed-base operator located at SNA, the helicopter was refueled with 15.8 gallons of 100 low-lead aviation fuel based on a request to top off the main fuel tank only.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUsing the basic empty weight of the helicopter, fuel load, and weights of the occupants and baggage, the helicopter weighed about 2,476 lbs at the time of takeoff with a longitudinal center of gravity (CG) of 93.42 inches. The calculated weight exceeded the published maximum gross weight of 2,400 lbs and the CG was near the forward range noted in the R44 Pilot Operating Handbook. - On January 30, 2018, about 1350 Pacific standard time, a Robinson Helicopter R44, N7530R, was destroyed when it impacted houses near Newport Beach, California shortly after takeoff. The private pilot and two of the three passengers sustained fatal injuries, one passenger sustained serious injuries, and one person on the ground sustained minor injuries. The helicopter was registered to Spitzer Helicopter and was operated by the pilot as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which originated from John Wayne-Orange County Airport (SNA), Santa Ana, California, about 1 minute before the accident, with an intended destination of Catalina Island, California.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe surviving passenger reported that the pilot and all of the passengers met at the pilot's office and planned to fly to Catalina Island for lunch. Following a brief conversation, the pilot drove the passengers to the airport. The passenger stated that, during the drive, the pilot received a phone call during which he appeared to be frustrated. The passenger asked if everything was ok, and the pilot responded everything was fine and he just wanted a different helicopter. Upon arriving at the airport, they all walked to the helicopter and the pilot appeared to conduct a preflight inspection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe passenger recalled that the pilot never asked any of the passengers about their weights, nor did he assign them seats. After all the passengers boarded the helicopter, they put on the headsets and the pilot started the engine. The passenger stated that the helicopter started to lift up, shimmied a little, and seemed to hover momentarily before it began a gradual climb. As the helicopter continued to climb steadily, in more of a level attitude than the initial lift off, the helicopter suddenly descended straight down nose first and impacted the ground. Following transport to the hospital, the passenger reported to law enforcement that the pilot said \"something's wrong\" and apologized to the passengers before stating that he could probably \"save it.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSurveillance video footage of the takeoff showed the helicopter slightly move forward in a nose low attitude, lift off, rotate left, increase in a nose-low attitude, and yaw to the right. As the helicopter briefly transitioned into a level attitude, it moved momentarily out of view behind a parked airplane. The tailboom of the helicopter became visible shortly after, in an elevated attitude consistent with a nose-low pitch attitude. As the rest of the helicopter became visible, it appeared to be in a slight climbing left turn, remaining in a nose-low attitude. The helicopter briefly descended and appeared to transition into a level attitude before it began a climb. The helicopter continued the climb while transitioning to a nose-low pitch attitude as it traveled out of frame.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness adjacent to the accident site reported observing the helicopter \"going down quickly  diagonally\" before it \"pulled [the] nose up and appeared to try an auto rotation while it continued to go down.\"  A second witness reported that they observed the helicopter flying on an easterly heading and descending until it impacted two residential houses.  The witness reported that they did not see any parts come off of the helicopter prior to the impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of archived Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar data revealed that the helicopter departed SNA on a southerly heading followed by a slight left turn to a southeasterly heading. The data showed that the helicopter climbed to a maximum altitude of 500 ft mean sea level (msl) and traveled along a southeasterly heading for about 13 seconds. The data showed that the helicopter then descended from 500 ft msl to the last recorded target, at 200 ft msl, in 11 seconds. The last recorded radar return was almost directly above the initial impact area. Review of recorded radio transmissions revealed that the pilot did not make any distress calls. - The Orange County Coroner, Santa Ana, California, performed an autopsy on the pilot. The autopsy report indicated that the cause of death was multiple blunt force traumatic injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing on specimens recovered from the pilot performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified unspecified amounts of Irbesartan in the blood and urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIrbesartan is a prescription medication used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. It is not considered to be impairing. - A review of recorded data from the SNA automated weather observation station, located about 2 miles north of the accident site, revealed that the conditions at 1353 included wind from 210° at 5 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, few clouds at 13,000 ft above ground level (agl), broken cloud layer at 18,000 ft agl, temperature 26°C, dew point -2°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.98 inches of mercury. - The pilot held a private pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating and a third-class FAA medical certificate issued on July 11, 2016, with no limitations. The pilot reported on the application for the medical certificate 195 total hours of flight experience, of which 25 hours were in the previous 6 months. The pilot's logbooks were not located. - The helicopter impacted multiple residential structures and a residential street about 0.95 nm miles south-southeast of the departure end of runway 20R at SNA. The initial impact point was identified by damage to the roof of a single-story home. The tail rotor gearbox and one tail rotor blade were located on top of the roof of a single-story home, partially lodged within a hole in the roof. The empennage and opposing tail rotor blade were located between the two homes, surrounded by thick vegetation. Additional impact damage was observed to a palm tree located between the homes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNumerous impact gouges and paint transfer marks were located on the street in front of both homes, consistent with fuselage and main rotor blade impact. The helicopter came to rest on its left side against a single-story home on a heading of about 189° magnetic, about 86 ft from the first identified point of impact. Throughout the wreckage debris path, plexiglass fragments, clay roofing material, palm tree fragments, and portions of both main rotor blades were observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe empennage and the aft section of the tailcone were separated from the airframe. The empennage was separated from the tailcone. The tail rotor gearbox was separated from the empennage and tailcone. The skids were detached and folded underneath the wreckage. The forward section of the tailcone was bent forward almost 180°.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward tail rotor drive shaft flex coupling was intact. The intermediate flex coupling was distorted and detached at one arm. The tail rotor drive shaft was separated into multiple sections. The tail rotor drive shaft damper assembly was detached from the tailcone and the tail rotor drive shaft bearing. The bearing rotated freely. The friction at the damper linkage was normal. The aft flex coupling was detached at the tail rotor gearbox yoke input arms. The tail rotor gearbox rotated freely and contained oil. The slider bearing rotated freely. One of the tail rotor blades was separated and distorted. The opposing blade remained attached and exhibited leading edge damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe drive belts remained intact and in place within their respective grooves. The sprag clutch operated normally. The belt tension actuator was intact and when operated, the belt tension actuator extended and contracted.  Both the upper and lower actuator bearings rotated freely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blades remained attached to the hub. Both main rotor blades were intact. One of the rotor blades was bent upward about mid-span and exhibited slight bending opposite of the direction of rotation near the blade tip. A portion of the blade honeycomb skin structure was torn away from the spar at the blade tip. The opposing main rotor blade exhibited dents and scuffs about 10 inches outboard of the hub. The blade was bent downward about 135° about 2 ft outboard of the hub. The blade was also bent upward mid-span and bent aft opposite of the direction of rotation along the outboard third of the blade. A portion of the blade honeycomb skin structure was torn away from the blade tip.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDents observed in the oil cooler were consistent with impact from the starter ring gear. At the upper belt sheave, score marks consistent with rotational contact from adjacent components were observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was established throughout the helicopter from the cockpit controls to the main rotor and tail rotor controls through various overload fractures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the airframe. The upper spark plugs were removed. The electrodes were undamaged and exhibited color consistent with normal operation with the exception of the No. 3 spark plug, which was oil-soaked. The engine crankshaft was rotated using the cooling fan. Compression and suction were obtained on all six cylinders.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe oil sump screen was removed and contained two small plastic fragments consistent with the magneto drive bushings. The oil filter was removed and cut open. The internal filter element exhibited no debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was installed on a test stand. In order to facilitate an engine run, a slave starter and propeller were installed. The engine was started and ran uneventfully. During the engine run, the No. 3 cylinder was not producing any exhaust gas temperature (EGT) readings on the engine monitoring unit installed on the test stand. The engine was shut down and further inspected. The bottom spark plug lead of the No. 3 cylinder was found impact damaged, and the upper spark plug lead was pulled away from the ignition cap. A serviceable ignition harness was installed for both the left and right magnetos. The engine was started a second time and operated throughout various power settings. At maximum power, the engine produced 2,600 rpm at 29 inches of manifold pressure. Engine rpm drops during magneto tests were within specification. The engine ran uneventfully until it was shut down using the mixture cut-off.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo evidence of any preexisting mechanical malfunction was observed with the airframe or engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor further information, see the Accident Site, Airframe, and Engine Examination Summary report and Robinson Helicopter's report within the public docket for this accident. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The purpose of the wildlife capture flight was to catch and collar mule deer for tracking. The flight was operated with three crewmembers: a pilot, a gunner, and a mugger. The pilot sits in the front left seat, the gunner sits in the rear left seat and shoots nets from a net gun in order to capture deer, and the mugger sits in the front right seat and exits the helicopter to handle the tagging and release of the deer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a refueling stop after about 2 hours of flight, the pilot mentioned to the biologist that it was quite windy. The helicopter then departed; data from an onboard GPS unit showed the helicopter flying northeast through the ravine before reversing course and proceeding southwest through the ravine when the flight track ended in the vicinity of the accident site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the site revealed two nets slightly northeast of the main wreckage. One net was mostly closed at the bottom of the ravine, with one weight extended farther than the others. This weight exhibited damage inconsistent with the other weights and was missing its rubber ring. Metallurgical examination of the weight revealed aluminum transfer marks. Another net that was partially open was located about 6 ft north of the first net and slightly up the western ravine wall. A piece of tail rotor skin was found about 5 ft farther north. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, nearby airports were reporting wind gusts between 23 and 35 knots.  A High Resolution Rapid Refresh model over the accident site identified strong low-level winds, with a maximum wind 1,000 ft above the surface from 230° at 48 knots. AIRMET Tango for low-level wind shear and turbulence due to strong winds was current for the area of the accident site at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies with the engine that would have precluded normal operation. The tail rotor hub and stop exhibited contact marks and dents consistent with excessive tail rotor blade flapping. The tail rotor blades remained attached at the hub. One blade appeared undamaged, and the outboard 2 inches of the second blade had a dent with gouge marks with evidence of metal transfer consistent with stainless steel, similar to that of the net weight; the remaining section of the blade was bent and curled. One side of the tail rotor skin was fracture-separated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on the marks on the tail rotor blade and on the net weight, it is likely that the net weight struck the leading edge of the tail rotor, which resulted in a fracture of the tail rotor tip and subsequent imbalance of the tail rotor blades. This imbalance resulted in excessive tail rotor blade flapping and subsequent loss of control. Despite two net guns being present in the helicopter, the angle the net weight impacted the tail rotor is consistent with the net originating from the left side of the helicopter. In addition, since there are several accounts of windy conditions it is potential that the wind affected the nets ability to open and possibly the net trajectory.",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to the maintenance logbooks, the most recent maintenance on the helicopter was a 100-hour inspection of the airframe and a 150-hour inspection of the engine, which occurred on January 17, 2018, at an airframe total time of 11,793 hours and an engine total time of 4,760 hours. - On January 27, 2018, about 1534 Pacific Standard time, a Hughes 369D helicopter, N369TH, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain about 10 miles northwest of Pomeroy, Washington. The commercial pilot and one crewmember were seriously injured, and the second crewmember was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to McCall Helicopters Inc, and was being operated by Kiwi Air, doing business as Hells Canyon Helicopters, as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the wildlife capture flight that originated from a nearby staging area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flight was to capture and collar mule deer for tracking. The operator reported that a wildlife capture flight requires three crewmembers: a pilot, a \"mugger,\" and a \"gunner.\" The pilot sits in the front left seat and flies the helicopter, the gunner sits in the left rear seat and shoots nets out of a net gun in order to capture the deer, and the mugger sits in the front right seat and exits the helicopter to handle the tagging and release of the deer. The guns usually have an empty cartridge inside; live ammunition is only put into the cartridge when the crew is in pursuit of a deer. The pilot always indicates when it is safe for the gunner to shoot. On the day of the accident, the mugger was training as a gunner; therefore, the helicopter was equipped with two net guns rather than the typical one.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA biologist from the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife reported that, after the helicopter was flying for about 2 hours, he met it during its refueling stop, when the crew dropped off samples from previously captured deer and took on additional collars. During the stop, the pilot mentioned that it was quite windy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nData retrieved from an onboard Garmin 496 GPS unit indicated that, after refueling, the helicopter proceeded generally southwest then turned west. The helicopter flew south of the ravine, turned northeast through the ravine, then reversed its course southwest before the flight track ended in the vicinity of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot did not recall the accident flight. The gunner only recalled portions of the flight. He remembered that it was windy that day; however, the nets were still opening. He recalled the pilot hovering, which was challenging due to the wind. He also remembered catching between 5 and 7 deer, and he vaguely remembered the mugger working on a deer after the refueling stop. He reported that the mugger had gunned in the past, but he did not recall him gunning on the accident flight. He also remembered the helicopter spinning shortly before impact. - The station models surrounding the accident site depicted west-southwest winds of 25 knots with higher gusts, scattered clouds, temperatures around 40°F, and dew points around 30°F.  At the time of the accident, nearby airports were reporting wind gusts between 23 and 35 knots. A High Resolution Rapid Refresh model over the accident site identified strong low-level winds with a wind maximum at 1,000 ft above the surface from 230° at 48 knots. Inflight weather advisories current for the region at the time of the accident included an AIRMET Tango for low-level wind shear and turbulence due to strong winds. - The pilot had about 8 years of experience flying wildlife capture flights and had owned Kiwi Air for about three years at the time of the accident. - The accident site was located in a small northeast-to-southwest-oriented ravine about 6 miles west of the refueling location. The helicopter came to rest on its right side at the bottom of the ravine with its nose oriented on a northeast heading. Immediately adjacent to the main wreckage were impact marks along the lower portion of the western ravine wall consistent with the helicopter's two skids; the right skid was fracture-separated in this area. The cabin was mostly intact, although the right side and floor sustained crush damage. The main rotor head was intact and one main rotor blade was wrapped around it. The four remaining main rotor blades were fracture-separated and were found near the main wreckage; the blade tips were scattered to the south. The tailboom was fracture-separated about 2 1/2 ft forward of the empennage, and the empennage came to rest just north of the cabin area. The tail rotor assembly and tail rotor transmission were found just north of the main wreckage slightly up the western ravine wall. Continuing further north at the bottom of the ravine was a net that was mostly closed, with one weight extended farther than the others. This weight exhibited damage inconsistent with the other weights and was missing its rubber ring. A second, half-opened net was located about 6 ft north of the first net and slightly up the western ravine wall. About 5 ft farther north was a piece of tail rotor skin, and about 15 ft up the eastern ravine wall was a main rotor blade tip cap.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a postaccident examination of the engine, a borescope examination of the gas generator turbine revealed no evidence of operational damage, thermal discoloration, or damage consistent with abnormal combustion. Metal splatter was observed on the first stage turbine nozzle shield. Examination of the compressor revealed damage consistent with foreign debris; however, the compressor moved freely when rotated by hand. Control continuity could not be established from the cockpit to the engine due to deformation of the fuselage and cabin area. All pneumatic engine control lines were intact and the fittings were secure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's forward fuselage exhibited substantial impact damage, with the right side crushed inward. The lower fuselage exhibited upward and inward crushing on the right side; the canted frame and lower bulkhead behind the front seats were bent and distorted. Control continuity could not be established from the cyclic, collective, and anti-torque pedal controls due to broken and seized flight controls and control tube assemblies. The main rotor hub exhibited multiple fractures and deformation, as did the pitch housing assemblies, swashplates, strap packs, main rotor dampers, and main rotor blades. Continuity was established from the engine through the main drive shaft to the main transmission. From the main transmission, continuity was established up to the main rotor hub and back to a fracture in the tail rotor drive shaft. The main drive shaft was rotated by hand, but rotation was limited due to the damage of the main rotor hub. The tail rotor drive shaft was fracture-separated into three pieces and exhibited extensive rotational scoring, particularly toward the aft end of the drive shaft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe empennage was fracture separated but was mostly intact. Light-colored diagonal marks were observed on the side of the tailboom immediately adjacent to the tail rotor. The tail rotor assembly and transmission were mostly intact and fracture-separated from the end of the tailboom. The four bolts that connect the tail rotor transmission to the tailboom sustained damage; two of the bolts were sheared, one was missing, and one was bent downward. The tail rotor transmission rotated freely when manipulated by hand. The tail rotor stop and tail rotor hub exhibited contact marks and dents consistent with excessive tail rotor blade flapping. The tail rotor blades remained attached at the hub. One blade appeared undamaged, and the second blade sustained damage to the outboard two inches. One side of the tail rotor skin was fracture-separated, and the remaining section of the blade was dented, bent, and curled. The blade tip weight and endcap were fracture-separated and not located.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTailboom fragments and tail rotor skin components were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Materials Laboratory for further examination. The leading edge of the tail rotor blade exhibited a dent with gouge marks. The gouge marks displayed evidence of metal transfer (iron, nickel, chromium) consistent with stainless steel material similar to that of the net weight. In addition, the round surface of the net weight exhibited metal transfer consistent with contact with aluminum. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot, a pilot rated passenger and four passengers departed in the helicopter on a cross-country  flight in dark night visual meteorological conditions. According to the sole surviving passenger, the flight proceeded normally until it impacted the ground in level flight and came to rest inverted. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n The pilot initially survived the accident but succumbed to his injuries en route to the hospital. A witness who spoke to the pilot before he was transported from the accident site reported that the pilot said that he had flown into terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOverhead imagery revealed that the area surrounding the accident site comprised unpopulated ranchland grass and sparse, low brush. The imagery showed a reduced amount of visual terrain features in the area of the accident site during night conditions and there were no sources of ground lighting or illumination in the vicinity. The pilot's familiarity with the route of flight could not be determined. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was located on a nearly-level mesa that rose about 100 ft above the surrounding mountainous terrain. A postaccident examination did not reveal any preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter, and ground scars at the site were consistent with impact in a level attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing indicated a therapeutic level of diphenhydramine in the pilot's blood at the time of the accident, which likely impaired him to some degree; however, it could not be determined if psychomotor slowing from the diphenhydramine contributed to his inability to recognize and/or avoid the terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Advisory Circular (AC) 61-134, General Aviation Controlled Flight into Terrain Awareness, defines controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) as when an airworthy aircraft is flown, under the control of a qualified pilot, into terrain (water or obstacles) with inadequate awareness on the part of the pilot of the impending collision. Professional aviation articles on CFIT state that during night conditions where the height above terrain may be misperceived by a pilot, controlled flight into terrain can occur, even to experienced pilots. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGiven the lack of mechanical anomalies and the level impact attitude of the helicopter, it is likely that the pilot failed to maintain adequate altitude during cruise flight and subsequently impacted rising terrain.",
    "FactualNarrative": "A witness at the ranch in the Folsom, New Mexico, area was asked if he knew the route of flight for previous helicopter flights to the ranch. He reported that the few times that the pilot would have flown to the ranch would have mainly been from Perry Stokes Airport, near Trinidad, Colorado. He was not familiar with how many trips the pilot would have made from RTN to the ranch, but indicated that \"it was probably minimal.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Advisory Circular (AC) 61-134, General Aviation Controlled Flight into Terrain Awareness, defines controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) as when an airworthy aircraft is flown, under the control of a qualified pilot, into terrain (water or obstacles) with inadequate awareness on the part of the pilot of the impending collision.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn Australian Transport Safety Bureau Aviation Research and Analysis Report stated that at night, the absence of peripheral visual cues, especially below the aircraft, can give an illusion of height, and result in the pilot inadvertently flying lower than necessary.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn article in The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society, published in September 2008, titled Visual Misperception in Aviation: Glide Path Performance in a Black Hole Environment, stated that no pilot was immune from visual [spatial disorientation]. Pilots with more experience tended to fly even lower than those with less experience. - N658H, was registered as a Bell UH-1H, helicopter with serial no. 67-17658. However, the current type certificate holder for that serial number is Rotorcraft Development Corporation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was manufactured in 1967 and according to a representative of the type certificate holder (Rotorcraft Development Corporation), was added to the type certificate on August 13, 2007. The helicopter was a single-engine helicopter powered by a Honeywell (formerly Lycoming) T53-L-703 turbo shaft engine with serial number LE-10462Z, which drove a two-bladed main rotor system and a two-bladed tail rotor. T53 engines are a two-spool engine. The gas generator spool consists of a five-stage axial compressor followed by a single-stage centrifugal compressor, and a two-stage high pressure turbine. The power turbine spool consists of two stages. The engine has a maximum continuous rating of 1,300 shaft horsepower at an output shaft speed of 6,634 rpm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to information received from the FAA, the accident helicopter was released from the General Services Administration in May 1996 and was owned and operated by seven other civilian operators before Sapphire Aviation, LLC, purchased it on February 10, 2017.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA records showed the helicopter was certificated as a restricted category aircraft for external load operations. Title 14 CFR 91.313 states in part that no person may be carried on a restricted category civil aircraft unless that person is a flight crewmember, is a flight crewmember trainee, performs an essential function in connection with a special purpose operation for which the aircraft is certificated, or is necessary to accomplish the work activity directly associated with that special purpose.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to an inspection data sheet, updated on January 9, 2018, the helicopter had accumulated 4,420.5 hours of total time. - On January 17, 2018, about 1800 mountain standard time, a Bell UH-1H helicopter, N658H, impacted terrain near Raton, New Mexico. The helicopter was subsequently consumed by a postimpact fire. The commercial pilot, a pilot-rated passenger, and three other passengers were fatally injured. One passenger sustained serious injuries. The helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Sapphire Aviation LLC as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the area about the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed. The flight originated from the Raton Municipal Airport/Crews Field (RTN), near Raton, New Mexico, about 1750 and was destined for Folsom, New Mexico.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a statement taken by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspectors, the surviving passenger stated that the group of passengers boarded a private airplane in Houston, Texas and the airplane flew them to Raton, New Mexico. They subsequently boarded a company helicopter. The purpose of the helicopter flight was to take the group to personal function in Folsom, New Mexico. The passenger reported that the takeoff was normal. As they were flying east, the sun had gone down, and the stars were very bright. The passenger reported no turbulence during the flight. There were no unusual noises, no observed warning lights in the cockpit, and the pilot and copilot were calm; everything appeared normal. The passenger recalled that they were in level flight and when she heard a big bang as the helicopter hit the ground. After ground contact, the helicopter rolled forward coming to a stop upside down. The passenger was hanging from the seat belt, the door was not present, and jet fuel was pouring on her. She released her seat belt and egressed the helicopter. The helicopter was on fire and subsequent explosions followed. The passenger called 9-1-1 and waited for emergency responders.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a first responder, he arrived at the accident site about 2000 and paramedics arrived there about 2015.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot initially survived the accident but succumbed to his injuries en route to a hospital. A witness stated that he was with the pilot before he was loaded in the rescue helicopter and asked the pilot what happened. The pilot replied that the accident was his fault and that he had flown into terrain. - The New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, Albuquerque, New Mexico, performed an autopsy of the pilot. The pilot's cause of death was blunt force trauma with atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing conditions. The autopsy revealed that the pilot's heart was enlarged, and both ventricles were thickened. Severe coronary artery disease was identified with up to 75% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery and up to 40% stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery. In addition, there was microscopic evidence of previous ischemia.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology testing on specimens of the pilot. Etomidate was detected in heart blood, and 0.032 µg/mL of diphenhydramine was detected in femoral blood. Diphenhydramine was also detected in liver.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of postaccident treatment records indicated that the pilot was administered etomidate by paramedics following the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDiphenhydramine is used for the treatment of the common cold and hay fever. It carries the following Federal Drug Administration warning: may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). The therapeutic range for diphenhydramine is 0.0250 to 0.1120 µg/ml. Diphenhydramine can cause marked sedation, altered mood, and impaired cognitive and psychomotor performance. In a driving simulator study, a single 50 mg dose of diphenhydramine impaired driving ability more than a blood alcohol concentration of 0.100 gm/dl. - At 1753, the recorded weather at RTN was: Wind 030° at 10 kts; visibility 10 statute miles; sky condition clear; temperature 1° C; dew point -18° C; altimeter 30.26 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to U.S. Naval Observatory Sun and Moon Data, the end of local civil twilight was 1735 and local moonset was at 1754. The observatory characterized the phase of the moon as \"waxing crescent with 0% of the moon's visible disk illuminated.\" - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land, rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument helicopter ratings. He held an FAA second-class medical certificate issued on December 7, 2017. The pilot reported on the application for his medical certificate that he had accumulated 6,416 hours of total flight time and 44 hours in the six months before the examination. His medical certificate was issued with the limitation that he must wear corrective lenses for distant, have glasses for near vision. The pilot reported on an insurance questionnaire that he had accumulated 2,065 hours of total flight time in UH-1 helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot rated passenger held a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. He held a second-class medical certificate issued on December 11, 2017. The pilot-rated passenger reported on the application for his medical certificate that he had accumulated 3,140 hours of total flight time and 30 hours in the six months before the examination. His medical certificate was issued with the limitations that he must wear corrective lenses, and that the certificate was not valid for any class after December 31, 2018. The pilot-rated passenger reported on an insurance questionnaire that he had accumulated 120 hours of total flight time in UH-1 helicopters. - A cellphone and iPad were located in the wreckage and sent to the National Transportation Safety Board Vehicle Recorders Laboratory to be examined for data pertinent to the accident. The devices were found locked so no data was retrieved.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB conducted terrain mapping and viewpoint flights of the impact area using a small unmanned aircraft system. Video from the drone flights was overlaid with cockpit imagery from an exemplar helicopter as a visualization aid. The overlay showed that fewer visible terrain features were present near the accident area during night conditions than during day conditions. The UAS Aerial Imagery Factual Report is in the docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of local terrain revealed that, if the helicopter had flown directly from RTM to the destination, the terrain along the route would have been about 450 ft lower. The accident site was located about 4 nautical miles south of this route. - The main wreckage (fuselage) came to rest on a heading about 15° magnetic on a flat mesa about 10.7 nautical miles and 102° from RTN at an elevation about 6,932 ft mean sea level (msl). The mesa consisted mostly of small rocks and prairie grass. The area around the main wreckage was discolored and charred, consistent with a postaccident ground fire. There were no observed sources of ground light or illumination in the vicinity of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe initial observed point of terrain contact was a parallel pair of ground scars, consistent with the width of the helicopter's skids, which led directly to the main wreckage on a 074° magnetic bearing. The distance from the start of the parallel ground scars to the wreckage was about 474 ft. About 18 ft past the end of the ground scars was a 25-ft-long ground scar consistent with a main rotor blade slap, which ran perpendicular to the path of travel. The entire main rotor came to rest about 60 ft beyond the blade slap signature. The tail rotor and tail rotor gear box were resting nearby. The helicopter's main wreckage was located about 66 ft beyond the main rotor. It came to rest  upside down and the entire cabin section between the cockpit and tail boom was destroyed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right side of the cockpit sustained thermal damage. The cyclic and collective on the left side of the cockpit were in place. The left cockpit side anti-torque pedals were present and connected to their under-deck push-pull tubes. The collective had broken away from its mount. Its twist grip linkage was present and connected. The twist grip's under-deck push-pull tubes moved when the grip's linkage was manipulated by hand. The push-pull tube sections located between the seats were been destroyed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe collective control on the right side of the cockpit was separated from the floor deck. The right cyclic was not located. The right cockpit side's left anti-torque pedal was separated from it mount and the right anti-torque pedal was not located. Their connecting push-pull rod end were fractured into segments consistent with overload. All controls tubes aft of the cockpit were destroyed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCockpit instruments and avionics exhibited discoloration, charring, and deformation consistent with thermal damage. Two altimeters were located. The altimeter on the left side of instrument panel read 6,760 ft (Kollsman window indicated 30.18). The other altimeter had separated from its instrument panel. The altimeter's 100-ft needle detached from its instrument face. However, the 1,000-ft needle pointed at 6,000 ft (Kollsman window indicated 30.28).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe transmission and main rotor mast were present forward of the engine and laying on its right side. The transmission's case had been consumed by fire, revealing the main drive gear and planetary gear train. The main drive gear was intact with no mechanical gear/tooth damage evident. The engine drive/sprag clutch was aligned with the transmission where a fragment of the KaFlex coupling was attached and was consistent in appearance with an overload fracture. Fragments of the KaFlex and torque tube were located in the debris field and displayed signatures consistent with overload fractures. The stationary swashplate was present with one servo connection present. The other two control servo connection horns were destroyed by thermal damage. Three flight control hydraulic servos were located. All aluminum hardware connecting each end of each servo had been melted or destroyed. The rotating swashplate was present with one scissor attached and the other scissor exhibited thermal damage. One main rotor blade damper remained attached to the rotor mast. The other blade damper was located in the debris field near the main rotor assembly. The mast had separated at the rotor head with a circumferential fracture consistent with torsional overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine compressor cases, accessory gearbox housing, and inlet housing were consumed by fire. The output reduction carrier and gear assembly, which attaches to the inlet housing, was intact and recovered as a loose component. Gears within the accessory gearbox were recovered as loose components. There were no penetrations of the combustor plenum. The exhaust tail pipe was disassembled from the engine while on scene to document the second-stage of the power turbine. There were metal spray deposits on the suction side of the second-stage power turbine stator vanes. There was no damage to leading edge of either the second-stage power turbine stator vanes or the second-stage power turbine rotor blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left horizontal stabilizer had separated from the tail boom at its root. The right horizontal stabilizer remained attached to the tail boom.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFour of the 5 tail rotor drive shaft segments were aligned with the transmission and positioned along the top of the tail boom. The first drive shaft that spanned the space beneath the engine was not located; however, the steel end coupling was present at the aft end of the transit tube. All the drive shaft segments had detached from their coupling hanger bearings, except for the shaft connecting to the lower section of the intermediate (42°) gear box. The shaft extending upward from the 42° gear box had separated along with the tail rotor gear box. The 42° gear box remained attached to the tail boom. Oil was present in the case, and the gears could be rotated by hand. Tail rotor control push-pull tube was separated at the forward end of the tail boom. Control continuity was established from the forward section of the tail boom to the tail rotor gearbox mount. Control continuity from the forward section of the tail boom to the horizontal stabilizer was established. The tail rotor gear box, the attached drive shaft, tail rotor head, and both blades had been separated from the vertical tail and were located in debris field near the main rotor assembly. Oil was present in the tail rotor gear box. The tail rotor assembly remained intact. The pitch links were attached from the pitch horns to the cross head. Rotor head balance weights remained attached. The tail rotor shaft moved freely by hand, no binding in the gear box. The tail rotor red blade tip leading edge was peeled back, and the tip cap sheared off. The opposite blade had been bent outboard about 30° about midspan along the chord line.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor separated from the rotor mast at the bottom of the rotor head and showed a fracture surface consistent with torsional overload. Both main rotor blades (red and white) remained attached to their main rotor head blade grips. The stabilizer bar assembly had separated from the main rotor head and was located near the main rotor assembly. The pitch change links, the control tubes, and the mixing lever remained connected to the stabilizer bar assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe majority of the red main rotor blade's fiberglass and honeycomb blade afterbody had separated from its blade spar. Portions of the afterbody panels were discolored black and brown consistent with exposure to fire. The length of the red blade was about 21 ft 8 in. The outboard tip portion of the red blade had separated. The outboard 5 ft of the blade exhibited a broomstraw appearance. The drag brace remained connected. The pitch horn had sheared off the blade grip at its mounting pad.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe majority of the white main rotor blade's fiberglass and honeycomb blade afterbody had buckled and separated from the spar at 4 locations. The white blade's tip had sheared from its blade at a 45° angle. The length of the white blade was about 20 ft. The outboard tip portion of the blade had separated. The outboard 1 ft of the blade exhibited a broomstraw appearance. The drag brace remained connected. The pitch horn had sheared off the blade grip at its mounting pad. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot and the crewmember departed on a power line aerial observation flight. Security video showed the helicopter sat on the ramp, in falling snow, for over an hour before departing for the accident flight. While two people were seen in the video walking around the helicopter before the flight, the distance was too great to ascertain how much snow or ice may have accumulated in the engine inlet area or what, if any, preflight snow or ice removal actions were taken by either the pilot or the crewmember. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne witness in the area observed the helicopter descend at an angle before it impacted the ground. Recovered GPS data indicated that the helicopter was operating in right turns consistent with the slow, hover flight (line inspection operations) with at an altitude between 180 ft and 220 ft agl and an airspeed of less than 10 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSatellite, radar, and weather observations near the accident site supported low clouds and visibility with light to moderate snow fall at the time of the accident. Weather models and advisories support the probability of structural icing in the area at the time of the accident. In addition, witnesses described the snowfall as moderate at the time of departure from the airport and at the time of the accident. Photographs taken by law enforcement following the accident further illustrate falling snow and flat light and or white out conditions at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGround scars and damage to the helicopter were consistent with the helicopter impacting the ground in a vertical and level pitch attitude. Further, the damage to the main rotor hub and main rotor blades was consistent with excessive coning and downward flapping of the main rotor blades. These characteristics are consistent with a loss of engine power or thrust on the main rotor system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe RE-IGN bulb stretch signatures are consistent with activation of the engine ignition system, indicating that power turbine speed was low. The lack of stretch signatures on the flashing engine out caution panel light is likely due to the light's cycle stage at the time of the impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no mechanical anomalies with the helicopter, engine, or fuel system that would have precluded normal operations. There was no damage to the compressor, compressor front support vanes, or first-stages rotor blades that was consistent with hard body ingestion.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators were not able to determine how much snow or ice accumulated on the helicopter while it sat on the ramp or how much snow or ice was removed before the helicopter departed. The helicopter was operating at a slow forward airspeed and in hover for most of the flight increasing the likelihood of snow and or ice accumulation in the engine inlet area during the hover inspection operations. According to the engine manufacturer, snow ingestion cannot be ruled out as it does not always produce visible damage to the compressor. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped to prevent or mitigate the accumulation of snow in the inlet; only to prevent snow and ice from entering the engine through the fuel system. The manufacturer required the installation of the auto-reignition system in order to operate in snow and ice; however, the low altitude where the loss of engine power occurred was likely insufficient for a successful auto-relight and recovery of engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPerformance charts indicate the helicopter was operating within an airspeed and altitude combination which would make a successful autorotation difficult to perform. The flat light and/or white out conditions would increase the difficulty of judging altitude, depth, and distance during an autorotation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "An estimated weight and balance calculation showed that the helicopter had a takeoff weight of 1,900 pounds. According to the RFM and based on the weather at the time of the accident, there was enough power available for the planned flight. According to the Height-Velocity Diagram in the RFM, the helicopter was operating within the cross-hatched regions of the diagram. The RFM stated in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"…These areas represent hazardous airspeed/altitude combinations from which a successful autorotation landing may be difficult to perform. Operation within the cross-hatched area is not prohibited, but should be undertaken only with extreme caution.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTitle 14 CFR Part 91.155 Basic VFR weather minimums states that helicopters operating in class G airspace at 1,200 ft or less above the surface during day operations must have ½ statute mile visibility and remain clear of clouds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn November 2013, the FAA issued Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB SW-08-03R4) – Recommendations for Rotorcraft During Icing/Snowy Conditions. The SAIB describes the \"procedures to reduce the probability of an engine in-flight shutdown due to ice and/or snow ingestion. MOST helicopters are not approved or equipped for flight into icing conditions.\" \"Snow and ice can build up in the engine intakes and plenums when the rotorcraft is on the ground with the engine(s) not operating or are operating at a low power settings for extended periods.\" The SAIB went on to state that \"Snow may accumulate on or in the engine inlet area during hover…\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn addition, the FAA safety pamphlet \"Flying in Flat Flight and White Out Conditions\" addressed the dangers associated with these weather conditions. These dangers include the lack of reference points to be used in determined depth perception while landing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Helicopter Association International (HAI) Utilities, Patrol and Construction Committee Safety Guide for Helicopter Operators stated that detailed power line patrols, such as the accident flight, \"require the aircraft to spend extended periods in hovering flight out-of-ground effect or in slow flight.\" - According to the MD 500 Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) the helicopter was certificated in the normal helicopter category for day and night visual flight rules (VFR) operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped, nor was it required to be equipped, with either a radar altimeter or emergency locator transmitter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe RFM stated that flight into known icing is prohibited. \"Flight operation is permitted in falling and/or blowing snow only when the Automatic engine Reignition Kit and Engine Failure Warning System are installed and operable.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with the late configuration warning and caution indicators which included a \"flashing red engine out warning indicator\" in addition to an \"audible warning tone in headset.\" These indicators annunciate when gas generator speed (N1) falls below 55%.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with the automatic engine reignition kit, a later modified system (250-C18 or C20). According to the RFM, this kit arms the automatic reignition system whenever there is transmission oil pressure and the ARMED (lower light) light is illuminated. Rotor speeds less than 98 +/- 1% of the power turbine speed (N2) or N1 speed is below 55%, the RE-IGN (upper light) is illuminated and the igniter is activated. The RE-IGN light only goes out when manually reset by the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was also equipped with the anti-ice airframe fuel filter. This filter is designed to filter out ice particles and other solid contaminates from the fuel before it enters the engine fuel system. The RFM stated that use of this filter removes the requirement for using fuel containing anti-ice additives.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRolls-Royce Engine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Rolls-Royce M250-C20 Operations and Maintenance Manual contained several warnings regarding operations in snow and ice: \"AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURES BELOW 4°C (40°F). SOME TYPE OF ANTI-ICE PROTECTION IS REQUIRED, SUCH AS AN ANTI-ICE ADDITIVE OR A MEANS OF AIRFRAME FUEL ICE ELIMINATION. ENGINE FLAMEOUT COULD RESULT FROM FAILURE TO USE ANTI-ICE PROTECTION.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt further notes that, \"SNOW OR ICE SLUGS CAN CAUSE THE ENGINE TO FLAME OUT. BE SURE AVAILABLE PREVENTATIVE EQUIPMENT IS INSTALLED AND IN PROPER WORKING ORDER WHEN FLYING IN CONDITIONS WHERE SNOW OR ICE BUILD UP MIGHT OCCUR.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Rolls-Royce, a 1968 study showed that as little as 30 grams of snow/slush ingested in the engine inlet can induce a flameout in the Allison 250-series engines. - On January 15, 2018, about 1136 eastern standard time, a MD Helicopters Inc. 369HM helicopter, N4QX, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain near Perrysburg, Ohio. The commercial pilot and crewmember were fatally injured. The helicopter was owned and operated by Vista One Inc., under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as an aerial observation flight. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed and no Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight was filed for the flight. The local flight departed Wood County Airport (1G0), Bowling Green, Ohio, at 1024.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the owner of Vista One Inc., the pilot departed from the company base at the Wayne County Airport (BJJ), Wooster, Ohio, on the morning of the accident. The pilot landed at 1G0 to pick up the powerline inspector. The pilot fueled the helicopter with 20.68 gallons of Jet A fuel at 1G0. The accident flight was the first leg of aerial inspections on the transmission towers for the Toledo Edison power grid. The team was scheduled to conduct aerial inspections from Bowling Green to the Indiana/Ohio border over the following 4 weeks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA security camera at the Bowling Green Flight Center (1G0), located about ¼ mile from the fuel pumps, captured the arrival and departure of the helicopter. The helicopter arrived at 0920:56 and departed at 1023:53. About 1013, two people exited the building and moved towards the helicopter. They walked back and forth between the helicopter and the building and then walked around the helicopter for several minutes. Due to the distance of the helicopter from the camera, it is not clear what the specific preflight activities were. It appears that both people boarded the helicopter before the helicopter departed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, located just south of the accident site, observed the helicopter descend \"at an angle\" before it impacted terrain. The witness was indoors at the time and did not hear the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA search of radar facilities did not find any primary or secondary radar targets consistent with the accident helicopter. Data recovered from a handheld global positioning system unit (GPS), located in the wreckage, started at 1017:14 at 1G0 and terminated at 1136:34, at the accident location. Track data illustrated the helicopter in multiple right turns consistent with line inspection operations. The last few minutes of the track data showed the helicopter at an altitude between 800 ft and 840 ft mean sea level (msl) or between 180 ft and 220 ft above ground level (agl) and at an airspeed of less than 10 knots. - The Lucas County Coroner's Office, Toledo, Ohio, performed the autopsy on the pilot on January 16, 2018. The autopsy concluded that the cause of death was \"multiple blunt force trauma\" and the report listed the specific injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological tests on specimens that were collected during the pilot's autopsy. Results were negative for all tests conducted. - A weather study was conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in support of this accident investigation and the detailed weather study is available in the public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) Surface Analysis Chart for 1000 local depicted a low-pressure system located over southern Wisconsin with its associated frontal boundary stretching northward into Canada and southward into Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri. A high-pressure system was located over central Virginia. The accident site was located in between the high- and low-pressure systems. The station models around the accident site depicted air temperatures in the mid to high teens (Fahrenheit (F)), dew point temperatures in the low teens, with temperature-dew point spreads of 5° F or less, an east-southeast wind of 5 to 10 knots, overcast sky cover, and light snow.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 depicted abundant cloud cover above the accident site at the time of the accident, with that cloud cover moving from southwest to northeast. Infrared imagery indicated cloud tops at 13,000 ft msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was a meteorological impact statement valid for the accident site at the time of the accident for areas of marginal visual flight rules and instrument flight rules with light snow spreading from west to east in addition to light to patchy moderate ice between 1,500 ft and 10,000 ft msl spreading from west to east. There were Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) Sierra and Zulu valid for the accident site at the accident time for IFR conditions due to precipitation and mist and moderate icing conditions below 15,000 ft msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA search of official weather briefing sources, such as contract Automated Flight Service Station (AFSS) provider Leidos weather briefings and the Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS), was done and the accident pilot did not request a weather briefing through Leidos or DUATS.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA search of archived ForeFlight information indicated that ForeFlight did not have any record of the accident pilot requesting a weather briefing before or during the accident flight. ForeFlight did record that the accident pilot accessed the Central Great Lakes NOAA Doppler radar loop weather Imagery at 0958:07. With no internet access while in flight, ForeFlight is still able to access weather information directly from the FAA but leaves no remote record of such access. It is unknown if the accident pilot checked or received additional weather information before or during the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe weather conditions at 1G0 were visible in the security camera video. The visibility was reduced, and it was snowing. Witnesses at the airport characterized the weather at 1 ¼ to 1 ½ miles visibility, with moderate snow, and unknown ceilings. Photographs taken by law enforcement following the accident further illustrate falling snow and flat light and or white out conditions at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe general manager of the Bowling Green Flight Center reported that it was snowing when the accident helicopter arrived at the 1G0 fuel pump area around 0920. It was still snowing when the accident flight departed around 1024 with 1 to 1 ½ miles visibility. The flight support manager recalled 1 ¼ miles visibility and the accident helicopter departed into instrument meteorological conditions with moderate snow.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Current Icing Potential (CIP) product created by the National Weather Service and valid for the accident site indicated between a 20% to 50% probability of icing at 1,000 ft and 2,000 ft at 1200 at the accident site. The CIP indicated that the icing near the accident site would likely be trace to moderate intensity. The CIP also indicated an unknown chance of supercooled large droplets (SLD) near the accident site around the accident time. - Vista One Inc held a 14 CFR Part 133 Rotorcraft External Load certificate. The company conducted powerline inspections under 14 CFR Part 91 and in the past had conducted 14 CFR Part 91 sightseeing operations. Before the accident there were only two pilots employed, the accident pilot and the company owner. The owner stated that there were no operations or company manuals outlining operations procedures or company policies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the owner of the company, line inspection flights, such as the accident flight, involved the helicopter flying along the powerline, circling the tower, and then continuing along the line. It was the responsibility of the crewmember, using binoculars and a camera, to inspect the towers and lines for the security of cotter keys, nuts, bolts, and so on. The pilot would position the helicopter skids above the static line, about 20 ft, during these flights. He stated that it was typical for the helicopter to cover between 2 and 3 miles in an hour. In the accident report form, the owner stated that it was not normal to inspect the lines in snow and blowing snow due to the poor visibility and wind gusts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to several interviews with family members, both the pilot and the crewmember had expressed concerns about the maintenance of the helicopter. The crewmember expressed separately to his wife that the maintenance on the helicopters was a concern for him.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth the pilot and the crewmember also expressed pressure from management to complete the missions in a very timely manner, regardless of the weather. The wife of the crewmember recalled multiple conversations between the crewmember and the owner regarding the weather – it was \"horrible with cold and snow in the forecast.\" According to the crewmember's wife, the owner placed a lot of pressure on taking and completing the flights as they only had a short time to complete the work. - At the time of his most recent medical certificate application, the pilot reported no chronic medical conditions and no medications. The medical certificate contained the limitation \"Must wear corrective lenses.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's flight logbook contained entries dated between May 27, 2013, and December 28, 2017. The pilot had logged no less than 1,219.4 hours in helicopters; 212.7 hours of which were logged in the make and model of the accident helicopter. The pilot had logged 97.9 hours of simulated instrument flight time, and no flight time in actual instrument conditions. The last simulated instrument flight (0.4 hours dual received) was conducted September 30, 2015, in a Robinson R44 II helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot started work at Vista One Inc. on September 6, 2017, and recorded a flight in his logbook, dated 9/6/17, of .5 hours with the note \"Vista 1 First Day.\" The pilot had logged 309.3 hours of flight time in company helicopters between September 6, 2017, and December 28, 2017.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company did not provide any training records for the pilot. The owner recalled conducting a training flight with the pilot the week before the accident but did not provide any specifics for that flight. This flight was not logged in the pilot's flight logbook. The owner mentioned that the pilot had difficulty recalling how to clear the GPS track just before the accident flight. He also stated that the pilot did not recall how to operate the throttle past the detent. He did not report any other concerns with the pilot's performance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCrewmember&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe powerline inspector worked for Vista One Inc. for 2 to 3 years. He lived in West Virginia and would drive to Ohio when it was time to work. According to the crewmember's family, he had been flying from platforms for line inspection and maintenance since 2004. The owner of Vista One Inc. stated that the crewmember drove from his home West Virginia the evening before the accident and met the pilot at 1G0 for work on the day of the accident. - The accident site was in a dormant corn/bean field at an elevation of 620 ft msl. The wreckage came to rest about 120 ft west of power lines. There was no evidence that the helicopter impacted either the power lines or the transmission towers. There was no evidence of a postcrash fire. There were no ground scars leading up to the wreckage. The ground was frozen, and it had snowed before, during, and after the accident. Photographs provided by first responders illustrated extensive debris and disturbed ground immediately adjacent to the belly of the helicopter. The helicopter came to rest on its left side with the nose oriented on a heading of 256°.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage included the fuselage, tail boom, and main rotor system. Two main rotor blades came to rest on the ground and two main rotor blades were extended in the air. The tail boom was partially separated, and the left skid was separated, fractured into multiple pieces, and located about 20 ft south of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered from the scene and relocated to a secure facility for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWreckage Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage of the helicopter was examined under the auspices of the NTSB investigator in charge. The extensive details of the wreckage examination are contained in the docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lower fuselage exhibited extensive upward crushing along the entire span of the fuselage. The cabin of the fuselage was crushed up from the floor/belly of the helicopter. The left side of the helicopter exhibited more upward and sideways crush as compared to the right side. The upper and lower windscreens on the left and right side were impact damaged and fragmented.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe collective control, cyclic control, and anti-torque pedals were impact damaged but were otherwise continuous and correct. The tail rotor driveshaft was continuous from the main rotor transmission aft to the separation point at the tail boom. The tail rotor controls were continuous from the break at the center seat box area aft to the separation point at the tail boom.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub exhibited varying degrees of damage to the feathering bearings, droop stops, and upper hub areas consistent with excessive coning and downward flapping of the main rotor blades. The main rotor rotating controls from the rotating swashplate up to each respective pitch horn were intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom was partially separated about 25 inches forward of the aft frame assembly and remained attached at the electrical cables. The tail rotor driveshaft was impact separated at that point. The tail rotor control rod was impact separated. The tail rotor was rotated by hand and driveshaft continuity was confirmed up to its separation point. Both tail rotor blades were wrinkled and bent several inches outboard from the blade root. The tail rotor pitch control was actuated by hand and functioned as designed; control rod continuity was confirmed forward to the tail boom fracture location. There was no evidence of main rotor strike at the tail boom.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe horizontal and upper vertical fin were unremarkable. The lower vertical fin was impact damaged and crushed to the left.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe blue main rotor blade remained attached to the hub and was bent and wrinkled at the trailing edge along the entire span of the blade. The white main rotor blade remained attached to the hub and was bent down about 90° at the root of the blade. The blade was bent and wrinkled at the trailing edge along the entire span of the blade. The red main rotor blade remained attached to the hub and was bent up about 45° at the root of the blade. The blade was wrinkled at the trailing edge along the entire span of the blade. The yellow main rotor blade remained attached to the hub and was bent and wrinkled at the trailing edge along the entire span of the blade.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth the governor and the fuel control cables were continuous but distorted and both related bell cranks were impact damaged. The anti-ice cable was continuous and distorted. The positions of these controls at the engine were unreliable. There was drive continuity from the engine to the main rotor and the overrunning clutch was actuated by hand and functioned as designed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument panel was impact damaged. The airspeed read zero knots; the Kollsman Window was set at 30.44; the vertical speed indicator indicated 100 ft down.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel bladder was impact damaged. The fuel line at the fuel shut off valve contained about a quarter cup of fuel. There was residual evidence of fuel in the bladder. The start pump was impact separated from its mounting plate. The float arm on the fuel sending unit was bent. No visual contamination was noted in the sump area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe fuel filter contained fuel and the fuel was unremarkable. The fuel was smoky in appearance with a small amount of black particulate matter and water at the bottom. The airframe fuel filter element was unremarkable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine and its accessories were removed for further examination. The engine was intact, and external damage was noted to the outer combustion case. The fuel pump, fuel control unit, and the N1 turned freely when rotated by hand. The N2 did not rotate. Neither the upper nor the lower chip detectors displayed ferrous particles. The compressor inlet and first stage blades were free of any foreign object debris damage. The fourth stage turbine wheel was unremarkable and normal in appearance. All the external fuel, oil, and air line connections were at least finger tight. The fuel pump filter element was free of debris and normal in appearance. Fuel was present in the engine mounted fuel lines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe following fuel system components were removed, and cursory inspections conducted: fuel nozzle, fuel control unit, power turbine governor, and fuel pump. The driveshafts for the fuel pump and starter generator were fractured consistent with impact damage. The fuel control unit housing was impact damaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA NTSB Powerplants Group was convened following the initial wreckage examination. The engine was evaluated at Keystone Turbine Services under the auspices of the NTSB Powerplants Group Chairman and at the direction of the powerplants group. The examination of the engine and related systems revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operations. The details of the examination are contained in the Powerplants Group Chairman's factual report available in the public docket for this investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe examination of the engine did not reveal soft or hard body damage on the first stage compressor blades. According to the engine manufacturer, they had 9 events on record involving a loss of engine power due to water, snow, or ice ingestion. The manufacturer stated that ingestion of snow does not always result in visible damage to the blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGarmin GPSMAP&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA handheld Garmin GPSMAP 496 was recovered from the wreckage and sent to the NTSB's Recorders Laboratory for data recovery. Two tracks were recovered; the second track being consistent with the accident flight. The details of this data are contained in the public docket for this investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSwitch and Panel Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe auto re-ignition indicator panel and the \"Warning and Caution\" panel were submitted to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for examination. The radiographs for the re-ignition panel bulbs showed that the RE-IGN light bulb filaments were intact and stretched. The ARMED light bulb filaments were broken and stretched. The radiographs for all the light bulbs in the \"Warning and Caution\" panel were intact and not stretched. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was flying his company's helicopter during a low-altitude cattle herding flight. A witness saw the helicopter maneuvering over power lines; it subsequently descended in a nose-low attitude to ground contact and was consumed by postcrash fire. Both the power lines above the helicopter wreckage and the helicopter itself exhibited damage consistent with in-flight contact with the lines. An onscene examination of the wreckage did not reveal any preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter.",
    "FactualNarrative": "N4179M, serial number 4413, was a Robinson Helicopter R22 Beta, two-place, single main rotor, single-engine helicopter, with a spring and yield skid-type landing gear. A 145-horsepower Lycoming O-360-J2A engine, serial number L-40955-36E, powered the helicopter. The primary structure of its fuselage was welded steel tubing and riveted aluminum sheet. The tailcone was a monocoque structure consisting of an aluminum skin. Fiberglass and thermoplastics were used in the secondary structure of the cabin, engine-cooling system, and in other ducts and fairings. The doors were constructed of fiberglass and thermoplastics.  A copy of a logbook endorsement showed that the helicopter's most recent annual inspection was completed on October 23, 2017. - On November 20, 2017, about 1505 central standard time, a Robinson Helicopter R22 Beta, N4179M, impacted power lines and terrain near Electra, Texas. The commercial pilot was fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed by post crash fire. The helicopter was registered to the pilot and operated by Carmichael Helicopter Service LLC under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 other work use flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the area about the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed for the local flight, which originated at an unknown time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness in the area saw the helicopter herding cattle and heard a horn sounding during the low-level operation. He watched the helicopter maneuver back and forth over powerlines until it descended in a nose-low attitude. The helicopter impacted terrain and a ground fire ensued. - The Southwestern Institute of Forensic Sciences at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, performed an autopsy of the pilot and obtained toxicological samples for testing. The autopsy listed blunt force injuries as the cause of death.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) prepared a Final Forensic Toxicology Accident Report on the samples taken. The CAMI report, in part, indicated the sample sustained putrefaction and naproxen was detected in urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe CAMI description of Naproxen stated that it is a nonnarcotic analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent, which is available in prescription and nonprescription forms. It is not considered impairing. - At 1452, the recorded weather at the Sheppard Air Force Base/Wichita Falls Municipal Airport, near Wichita Falls (SPS), Texas, included wind from 190° at 15 kts; visibility 10 statute miles; sky condition few clouds at 25,000 ft; temperature 19° C; dew point -3° C; altimeter 29.91 inches of mercury. Peak wind at 1400 was from 190° at 28 kts. - The 25-year-old pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft helicopter rating. He held an FAA second-class medical certificate issued on December 15, 2016, with no limitations. On the application for that medical certificate, he reported accumulating 2,100 hours of total flight time and 400 hours in the previous 6 months. - The main wreckage, to include the fuselage, engine, and mast, came to rest on its right side with a 110° heading about 21 nautical miles and 276° from SPS. The fuselage forward of the firewall was discolored, deformed, and charred consistent with a postcrash fire. Both skids were found separated from the fuselage and one skid tip displayed semicircular witness marks consistent with arcing. The main rotor blades remained attached to its rotor mast. The helicopter's beacon light separated from the tailboom and the tailboom displayed sliding witness marks consistent with powerline contact. The aft portion of the tailboom separated and its tail rotor driveshaft was torn. The twisting separation of the driveshaft was consistent with overload. The aft section of the tail boom was found about 15° and 27 ft from the main wreckage. One tail rotor blade separated and its two liberated sections were found. The tail rotor blade tip was found about 340° and 120 ft from the main wreckage and the other section of the tail rotor blade was found about 80° and 85 ft from the main wreckage. The liberated blade separation surfaces mated and these sections exhibited semicircular deformation consistent with the shape and size of the powerline. The engine was discolored and deformed consistent with a postcrash fire. Flight and engine control continuity could not be established due to the fire damage. However, all observed discontinuities were consistent with overload or melting separations. A charred shell of a horn driver, consistent with an external speaker, was found in the wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to powerline repair personnel, the powerlines above the helicopter wreckage were damaged. One powerline was nicked and another line displayed strands that were separated. A nearby cross arms support was damaged. The powerline height was about 29 ft 3 inches above ground level. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter air ambulance flight was en route to pick up a patient when company satellite tracking was lost at an altitude about 1,250 ft mean sea level. The helicopter impacted a reservoir bank and a postimpact fire consumed a majority of the fuselage. Examination of the helicopter did not reveal any anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the wreckage found multiple bird remains, identified as snow geese, were located in the cockpit and embedded in the pilot's clothing and boot. Fragments of a night vision goggle (NVG) system near the pilot's position suggest that the pilot was using them for visual navigation; however, there was no moon illumination to enhance the NVG effectiveness, and it is unlikely that the pilot would have been able to visually detect the birds before impact. While the helicopter flight controls were continuous, it could not be determined if the bird strikes jammed the pilot's controls and/or incapacitated the pilot.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\nOn November 19, 2017, about 1855 central standard time, a Bell 407 helicopter, N620PA, impacted terrain near Stuttgart, Arkansas. The pilot and two medical crewmembers were fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Air Methods Corporation under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the positioning flight, which was operated on a company visual flight rules flight plan. The flight originated from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, at 1820 and was en route to pick up a patient in Helena, Arkansas.The helicopter was transmitting its position to the company via satellite communications. At 1855:50, the helicopter transmitted that it was heading 070°, traveling 116 knots at 1,252 ft mean sea level. This was the last recorded data point. The company initiated a search when satellite tracking was lost, and the wreckage was located several hours later. There were no known witnesses to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was a former military helicopter pilot having flown both AH-64 and OH-58 helicopters. He had been employed as a helicopter air ambulance pilot for over 3 years. He was assigned to the Pine Bluff area on September 30, 2016.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was modified via type supplemental certificate for helicopter air ambulance operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA weather study conducted for the accident area did not reveal any weather hazards around the time of the accident. Both the sun and the moon were more than 15° below the horizon, and dark night conditions existed with no illumination from the moon.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe nearest areas of cultural light were over 13 miles away.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was found on the bank of a reservoir on its right side  on a heading about 205°. All major components of the helicopter were accounted for at the site. A postimpact fire consumed a majority of the fuselage. The flight controls were fractured and fire-damaged. The cyclic, collective, and anti-torque pedals were fractured at the cockpit floor. All control mixing lever hardware was present with safety wires in place. Fractures on the control tubes were consistent with overload. The helicopter \"broom closet\" was consumed by fire. Control continuity was observed from the swashplate to the main rotor pitch change links. All main rotor blades remained attached to the main rotor hub. All blades were fractured in multiple locations; blade remnants and blade core pieces were found surrounding the accident site. The tail rotor drive shaft segments remained continuous with a small portion totally consumed by fire. The tail rotor blade rotated freely when the tail rotor drive shaft was rotated by hand. The tail rotor blades remained attached to the tail rotor yoke. Fragments of the pilot's night vision goggles were located in the area of the pilot controls. (Company policy required pilots and one crewmember to wear night vision goggles during night flights.) No preimpact anomalies were detected during postaccident examination of the helicopter airframe or engine. During the on-scene portion of the investigation, numerous geese, ducks, and cranes were observed in the reservoir and at another nearby reservoir.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMultiple bird remains were found from the cockpit area to the first bulkhead. Samples from the bird remains were sent to the Feather Identification Laboratory, Smithsonian Institution, National Museum of Natural History, Washington, DC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Arkansas Crime Laboratory, Little Rock, Arkansas, conducted an autopsy on the pilot. The cause of death was multiple injuries. The autopsy noted white bird feathers embedded in the pilot's coveralls and right boot. Samples of the bird feathers were also sent to the Smithsonian for examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Bioaeronautical Science Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology testing on specimens of the pilot. Testing was negative for all tested substances.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFeather Identification Laboratory, Smithsonian Institution&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSamples submitted to the Smithsonian contained remains from snow geese, which typically have an average weight of 4.8 and 5.48 lbs for females and males, respectively. The complete report is located in the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Wildlife Strike Database&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the FAA Wildlife Strike Database found a strike report for November 17, 2011, about 0705 central standard time; the pilot of a Cessna 210 airplane reported striking a snow goose near the area of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUnited States Air Force Bird Avoidance Model&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe US Air Force developed a Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) that analyzes and correlates bird habitats, migration patterns, and breeding characteristics with key environmental and man-made geospatial data. This model is used by military pilots and planners to monitor bird activity for strike mitigation purposes. Civilian pilots are not required to use the model and the investigation was unable to determine if the accident pilot was aware of the available information. At dusk, the strike probability for the accident area was forecast to be severe, and at night, the strike probability reduced to moderate. Overlays of this information with the helicopter's flight path is included in the public docket of this report.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCertification Standards&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Bell 407 is certificated under 14 CFR Part 27 as a normal category rotorcraft. As such, there are no bird strike safety requirements for the windshield. Transport category rotorcraft do have a requirement under 14 CFR 29.631 to be designed to ensure capability of continued flight and/or landing, however the design requirement assumed a single 2.2 lbs bird. The accident involved numerous birds in excess of 4 lbs each. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was conducting an external load flight with two linemen hoisted beneath the helicopter on a long line. The pilot reported that, as he maintained a hover over the power lines, the long line contacted the shield wire as one of the linemen held onto a conductor bundle. The long line severed about midspan as the pilot turned the helicopter into the wind and attempted to move the linemen away from the conductor bundle. The two linemen were fatally injured when they fell about 100 ft to the ground. The pilot returned to the landing zone and landed uneventfully.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot did not report any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation. Video footage of the accident confirmed that the helicopter's synthetic long line severed after extended lateral contact with the braided steel shield wire.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Local law enforcement reported that the 60 ft long synthetic long line severed about midspan. The long line was not equipped with an abrasion-resistant cover. A 100-ft synthetic long line equipped with an abrasion-resistant cover was found on the ground at the temporary landing zone near the operator's support vehicle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that the helicopter was operating under Part 133 Class B during the flight, and that linemen were considered crewmembers (not passengers) during powerline construction operations. The FAA had approved the helicopter's hook installation; however, because the flight was conducted under Part 133 Class B, the FAA did not regulate, specify, or approve the long line or the harnesses that was used to hoist the two linemen.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that the long line was a 7/16 inch Amsteel Blue synthetic rope made of Dyneema SK-75 synthetic fiber that had a break strength of 21,500 lbs. The operator reported that the use of Amsteel Blue synthetic rope had been an industry standard for at least 15-20 years, and that the use of synthetic rope is advantageous for powerline work because it is non-conductive and has a higher break strength than a similarly sized braided steel cable. The operator stated that the use of an abrasion-resistant cover was typically used to protect a long line from incidental contact with sharp edges on tower structures. Additionally, the operator stated that the use of an abrasion-resistant cover would not offer much protection if the long line had prolonged lateral contact with a braided steel cable. The operator noted that the use of a braided steel long line is not practical when working on powerlines due to the potential for electrocution. The operator reported that the pilot selects the length of the long line for a specific mission after he/she considers the required length to position the lineman at the specified workstation and to keep the helicopter above any wires, structures, or obstacles. The pilot chooses the shortest long line available that ensures obstacle clearance, which increases positive control of the cargo/linemen during the flight. - The helicopter, serial number 911027D, was manufactured in 1981 and was powered by a 450-horsepower Rolls-Royce 250-C20R/2 turboshaft engine, serial number CAE-295387. The helicopter had a maximum gross weight of 3,000 pounds and was equipped for external load operations. The FAA issued the helicopter a standard airworthiness certificate on December 29, 1981. The helicopter had accumulated 9,595.1 hours at the time of the accident. The last recorded maintenance was a 100-hour inspection completed on October 29, 2017, at 9,552.7 total airframe hours. - On November 7, 2017, at 0934 central standard time, a Hughes 369D helicopter, N138WH, was not damaged when its external cargo long line severed after contacting a shield wire suspended between power transmission towers near Sulphur, Louisiana. The two linemen being hoisted on the long line were fatally injured when they fell about 100 ft to the ground. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Winco, Inc. as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 133 external load flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local flight, which departed at 0932 from a temporary landing zone near the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the power company, the purpose of the flight was to install guard ropes between the deenergized 500-kilovolt power transmission lines before the existing braided steel shield wire from the nearby transmission tower was replaced. The east/west power transmission lines, with three sets of bundled conductors (northern, center, and southern), crossed perpendicular over a road. The pilot reported that, following a preflight safety briefing, he and one of the linemen discussed the expected work tasks. The pilot stated that, following their discussion, he brought the helicopter into a hover to allow the linemen to hook onto the external cargo long line. He then repositioned the helicopter to allow the linemen to work on the center conductor bundle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that, after the linemen had tied off the guard rope to the center conductor bundle, he repositioned the helicopter to allow work on the northern conductor bundle. The pilot reported that he saw the long line contact the braided steel shield wire as one of the linemen held onto the northern conductor. The long line severed as the pilot turned the helicopter into the wind and attempted to move the linemen away from the northern conductor. The pilot reported that, immediately before the long line severed, he observed one of the linemen tugging at the conductor to reposition the guard rope perpendicular to the conductors. After the long line severed, the pilot returned to the landing zone and made an uneventful landing. The pilot did not report any malfunction or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation. According to postaccident measurements made by local law enforcement and witness video footage of the flight, the 60-ft long line separated about midspan while it was in contact with the braided steel shield wire suspended between power transmission towers. - A postaccident review of available meteorological data established that day visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the accident site. The nearest aviation weather reporting station was located at Southland Field Airport (UXL), Sulphur, Louisiana, about 9 miles south of the accident site. At 0935, about 1 minute after the accident, the UXL automated surface observing system reported wind from 210° at 8 knots, 10 miles surface visibility, broken ceilings at 1,400 ft above ground level (agl), 2,400 ft agl, and 3,000 ft agl, temperature 27°C, dew point 23°C, and an altimeter setting of 30.11 inches of mercury. - According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the 71-year-old pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument airplane and helicopter. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on June 19, 2017, with no limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had accumulated 25,090 total hours of flight experience, of which 21,063 hours were logged as pilot-in-command and 11,286 hours were flown in Hughes 369 helicopters. The pilot flew 26 hours and 17 hours during the 90 days and 30 days before the accident, respectively. The pilot had flown less than 1 hour on the day of the accident. His most recent flight review, as required by Title 14 CFR 61.56, was completed on August 29, 2016, in a Hughes 369D helicopter. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot and passenger departed in the helicopter from the pilot's residence near a lake. Two witnesses who lived near the accident site saw the helicopter flying fast over the trees from the south side of the lake to the north. One of the witnesses reported that the helicopter \"swooped\" down over the lake and flew over the water past their house. Shortly thereafter, the helicopter's skids touched the water and the helicopter impacted the lake.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe passenger reported that the pilot descended close to the water and hovered while the passenger took pictures. The helicopter subsequently dipped to the right, followed by the main blades hitting the water; the helicopter descended into the lake and rolled onto its right side before beginning to sink. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter sank in about 31 ft of water subsequent to impact. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely that the pilot misjudged the helicopter's height above the water while maneuvering at a low altitude, which resulted in impact with the water.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The two-seat helicopter, serial number (S/N) 0441, was manufactured in 1984. It was powered by a Lycoming O-320-B2C engine, serial number L-16194-39A, rated at 160 horsepower. Airframe and engine times in service could not be determined as no maintenance records were recovered during the investigation. The Hobbs meter recorded time was 3,334.8 hours. FAA records indicated that the airplane was deregistered in May 2015. - On October 24, 2017, about 1315 Pacific daylight time, a Robinson R22 Alpha helicopter, N8537J, was substantially damaged following impact with water while performing a low-level maneuver at King Lake near Arlington, Washington. The commercial pilot was fatally injured, and the passenger sustained minor injuries. The helicopter was owned by the pilot who was operating it as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local flight, which departed the pilot's residence, located about 1,350 ft south-southwest of the accident site, about 5 minutes before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a postaccident telephone interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC), the passenger reported that he arrived at the pilot's residence about 1200 on the day of the accident, after which he and the pilot discussed going for a flight in the accident helicopter if the weather was good. After the pilot assessed that the weather was fine, he stated that they would be flying to the Arlington Airport to get fuel. The pilot then went out, looked over the helicopter, and prepared for the flight. After both he and the pilot secured their seat belts and shoulder harnesses, the pilot started the engine and let it warm up; then they departed. He said that, after circling the pilot's residence, the pilot brought the helicopter to a hover close to their departure point, where the pilot's wife took some pictures of them before giving them a thumbs-up. The pilot then proceeded away from his residence toward King Lake. During the approach to the lake, the pilot dipped down close to the water \"…where he hovered while I was taking some pictures.\" Shortly thereafter, the helicopter dipped to the right, followed by the main rotor blades hitting the water, \"…which took us in.\" He said the helicopter then listed onto its right side before beginning to sink, at which time he was almost immediately in the water. The passenger unbuckled his seat belt and shoulder harness, crawled through the left door, and surfaced from the water. He then saw the pilot come up to the surface, and the pilot stated that he could not swim; the passenger attempted to tow him to shore, but it was too far, and he had to let go. The passenger was subsequently picked up by a first responder in a small boat. They brought the pilot to shore and performed CPR. The passenger stated that at no time did he recall the pilot being under water for any extended period.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who lived less than 100 yards west of the accident site reported that he observed the helicopter come over the trees and drop down to fly over the lake south to north. The witness stated that the pilot had performed this type of maneuver many times in the past, and sometimes hovering over the center of the lake. The witness further stated that this time [the pilot] dropped about 6 ft from the surface of the lake (south to north), and about the middle of the lake. The witness mentioned that he noticed the [skid] hit the water, then dove forward hitting the water very hard with an explosive sound; \"I saw parts of the helicopter fly off.\" The witness added that the engine sounded normal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA second witness, who lived with the first witness, reported that she heard a helicopter coming from the direction of the accident pilot's residence. The witness stated that she observed the helicopter from her kitchen window flying fast over the trees, then it swooped down and flew over the water past her house. The witness mentioned that she then walked over to the front room and watched the helicopter from the picture window. \"I saw him flying fast over the water, and very close to the water. The helicopter's skids touched the water and [it] exploded into little pieces.\" The witness added that the pilot flew all the time, knew the lake well, and would sometimes fly by their house, hover over the lake for a while, then fly away. The witness opined that, this time, the pilot got too close to the lake and was not hovering. \"He was zooming [about 3 ft] above the water and just went down. Looked like his skids hit the water.\" The witness stated that the helicopter sounded normal. - On November 26, 2017, an autopsy was performed on the pilot at the Snohomish County Medical Examiner's Office, Everett, Washington. The cause of death was attributed to freshwater drowning.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA's Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified atropine in the blood; no carbon monoxide, alcohol, or other drugs were detected. Testing for cyanide was not performed. - At 1256, the weather reporting facility at Arlington Municipal Airport (AWO), Arlington, Washington, about 6 nm west-northwest of the accident site, reported wind from 320° at 7 knots, 10 miles visibility, clear sky, temperature 16°C, dew point 9°C, and an altimeter setting of 30.42 inches of mercury. - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane multiengine land, single-engine land, rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument airplane. The pilot's most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) third-class medical certificate was issued on May 3, 2007, with a limitation for corrective lenses. On the application for that certificate, the pilot reported 5,100 total hours of flight experience with 100 hours in the previous 6 months. There were no pilot flight records located during the investigation. The pilot's medical certificate expired for all classes on May 31, 2009. FAA records revealed that the pilot never reapplied for a medical certificate and that he had not completed the requirements for operation under Basic Med. - An examination of the accident site was performed by the NTSB IIC about 2 hours after the accident. The helicopter impacted water on a northerly heading about the mid-lake area and subsequently sank. Aside from remnants of the main rotor blades, which were recovered and placed on shore by first responders, no other components of the helicopter were recovered at that time. The helicopter was recovered from its submerged location to the south shore of the lake during the afternoon of October 30. A post-recovery examination revealed that the helicopter was primarily intact, except for the aft tail boom and right wind screen, which were separated from the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the airframe and engine was conducted on December 12, 2018. There was no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation (refer to the Summary of Aircraft Examination, which is appended to the docket for this accident.) -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "During a night instructional flight in the helicopter, the commercial pilot receiving instruction and the flight instructor departed and flew uneventfully to an adjacent island, where they conducted a practice instrument approach to an airport before they initiated the published missed approach procedure. As the flight reestablished radio communication with air traffic control, the pilots obtained an instrument flight rules clearance for their return to the departure airport. Radar and radio contact with the helicopter were lost shortly thereafter. Air units from the United States Coast Guard and a local fire department located some floating debris in the ocean the night of the accident and the day following the accident, respectively. The wreckage was located about 12 months following the accident submerged in the Pacific Ocean at a reported depth of 298 ft. A portion of the located wreckage was recovered about 3 months later. A postaccident examination of the recovered wreckage revealed no evidence of any preexisting mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation of the airframe or engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather radar depicted an area of moderate-to-heavy rain showers along the helicopter's flight path about the time radar and radio contact were lost. Although the pilots had access to sufficient weather information to properly plan their flight around the weather and could have asked for further assistance in avoiding the weather from air traffic control, they elected to fly into an environment favorable to unexpected changes in wind direction and speed due to heavy rain showers, which could result in localized instrument meteorological conditions; however, because only a portion of the wreckage was recovered, the reason for the helicopter's sudden descent and impact with open ocean waters could not be determined.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The accident helicopter was a Robinson R44 II, four-place, two-bladed, single main rotor, single-engine helicopter with skid-type landing gear. The primary structure was welded steel tubing and riveted aluminum. The tailboom was a semi-monocoque structure consisting of an aluminum skin. The helicopter was equipped with a Lycoming IO-540-F1B5 engine, rated at 260 horsepower; however, according to the helicopter's type certificate, the de-rated engine had a 5-minute takeoff rating of 245 horsepower and a maximum continuous rating of 205 horsepower. The helicopter was certified for day and night visual flight rules operations only.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the airframe and engine logbooks revealed that the most recent annual inspection was completed on September 28, 2017, at an airframe total time of 4,209 hours and an engine total time since major overhaul of 2,009.2 hours. - On October 16, 2017, about 1918 Hawaii-Aleutian standard time, a Robinson Helicopter R44, N820DF, impacted the Pacific Ocean near Molokai, Hawaii. The flight instructor and commercial pilot receiving instruction are missing and presumed to be fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to Stasys Aviation Leasing LLC and was being operated by Hawaii Pacific Aviation, doing business as Mauna Loa Helicopters, as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight. Instrument and visual meteorological conditions existed in the area around the time of the accident, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the flight, which originated from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (PHNL), Honolulu, Hawaii, at an undetermined time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInformation provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) indicated that air traffic control (ATC) cleared the flight for a practice RNAV (GPS)-B instrument approach to the Molokai Airport (PHMK), at which time the pilots requested a pop-up IFR clearance to PHNL. The controller instructed the pilots to depart via the published missed approach to 4,000 ft, and expect clearance on departure, which the pilots acknowledged. The controller subsequently terminated radar service, approved a frequency change, and informed the flight to return to that frequency after conducting the missed approach.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight executed the missed approach as instructed and reestablished radio contact with ATC about 1 mile north of PHMK as it was climbing through 1,700 ft. The controller radar-identified the helicopter and subsequently issued a clearance to PHNL with instructions to fly a heading of 260° and climb to 4,000 ft. About 4 minutes later, the controller issued a heading change to 240° to intercept the Victor 8 airway; the pilots acknowledged. About 2 minutes later, the controller advised the flight that radar contact with the helicopter was lost. No further radio transmissions were received from the pilots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRadar data showed that the flight's radar track started about 1.3 nautical miles (nm) northeast of PHMK and remained on a north-northeasterly heading while climbing from 1,700 ft to 3,500 ft msl for about 3 minutes. The helicopter then entered a left turn to a westerly heading while continuing a climb to 4,000 ft msl. The track continued on a westerly heading for about 2 more minutes before it began a right turn to an east-southeasterly heading. About 35 seconds later, the helicopter entered a left turn to a northwesterly heading and began descending from 4,000 ft msl to 3,700 ft msl over about 35 seconds. Shortly thereafter, the track continued in a left turn to a southeasterly heading for about 19 seconds while climbing to 3,900 ft. The helicopter then turned to a westerly heading and had descended to about 2,700 ft when radar contact was lost about 6 miles northwest of PHMK.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA representative from the United States Coast Guard reported that, after the helicopter was reported missing, an air unit located debris and a red chemlight floating in the ocean northwest of Molokai. The following day, an air unit from the Maui Fire Department located an uninflated life jacket along the northwest shoreline of Molokai. The search for the helicopter was suspended on the evening of October 19, 2017. Reported water depths in the vicinity of the last radar target varied between 348 ft and 1,812 ft. - At 1854, the recorded weather conditions at PHMK, located 6.3 miles southeast of the last radar target, included wind from 030° at 8 knots gusting to 21 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, light rain, few clouds at 3,300 ft above ground level (agl), a broken cloud ceiling at 6,000 ft agl, a broken cloud layer at 7,000 ft agl, temperature 24°C, dew point 20°C, and an altimeter setting of 30.04 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest National Weather Service (NWS) Weather Surveillance Radar-1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) to the accident site was the Molokai, Hawaii, radar (PHMO), which was located 6 nm south-southwest of the accident site at an elevation of 1,363 ft. The WSR-88D captured base reflectivity imagery at 1917 and 1918 (shown in figures 1 and 2, respectively; the black line shows the helicopter's flight path). The imagery depicts moderate-to-heavy values of reflectivity within the vicinity of the last radar target. Rain showers and convective clouds produce outflow boundaries and gust fronts throughout their life cycle. An outflow boundary or gust front can create an environment favorable for unexpected changes in wind direction and speed. There were no lightning strikes in the vicinity of the last radar target around the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: WSR-88D base reflectivity imagery at 1917&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2: WSR-88D base reflectivity imagery at 1918.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NWS office in Honolulu, Hawaii, issued an Area Forecast Discussion (AFD) at 1600, which was the closest AFD to the accident time. The aviation section of the AFD discussed that the trade winds would bring strong gusty northeast winds; AIRMET Tango was valid for temporary moderate turbulence. Scattered rain showers were forecast to continue through the day with reduced ceilings and visibility in the showers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA search of official weather briefing sources revealed that neither pilot requested an official weather briefing from Leidos or DUATS; however, one of the pilots requested ForeFlight weather information at 1803. The weather information from ForeFlight contained the most recent METARs, AIRMETs, PIREPs, Area Forecast, TAFs, and Winds Aloft Forecast. It is unknown if either pilot checked any additional weather information before or during the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor further meteorological information, see the weather study in the public docket for this investigation. - Flight Instructor&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight instructor, age 24, held a commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter ratings. In addition, he held a flight instructor certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument-helicopter ratings. The flight instructor was issued a second-class FAA medical certificate on January 5, 2017, with the limitation, \"must wear corrective lenses.\" On the application for that medical certificate, the flight instructor reported a total flight experience of 630 hours, of which 300 hours were in the previous 6 months.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot Receiving Instruction&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot receiving instruction, age 27, held a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. He held a second-class FAA airman medical certificate that was issued on June 2, 2017, with the limitation, \"must wear corrective lenses.\" On the application for that medical certificate, the pilot reported a total flight experience of 139 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the pilot's flight training records revealed that, as of the most recent entry, dated October 12, 2017, he had accumulated a total of 186.9 hours of flight experience, of which 18.5 hours were in the previous 30 days. - A private company hired by an individual to locate the helicopter reported that, in October 2018, they initially located the wreckage  submerged about 2 miles offshore of Molokai at a depth of 298 ft. A representative from the company reported that they recovered a portion of the wreckage on January 24, 2019.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of video recordings from an underwater remotely-operated vehicle showed that the fuselage was severely fragmented and partially embedded within the ocean floor. Both main rotor blades remained attached to the hub, which remained attached to the drive shaft. Both main rotor blades appeared to be straight with visible damage to the tip of one blade. The main rotor pitch link on one blade remained attached to the blade and swashplate, the other was not visible. The main rotor drive shaft was bowed on the lower end. The tailboom was impact damaged and the tail rotor gearbox was separated. The tail rotor drive shaft remained inside the tailcone. The tail rotor drive shaft was disconnected about 10 inches aft of the intermediate flex coupling and appeared angular and jagged. The intermediate flex coupling was not bent or distorted. No visible damage to the grooves of the upper sheave were observed. The forward flex coupling was disconnected/fractured from the clutch shaft. The skid assemblies were separated. Portions of the fuel system, cyclic, and collective controls were not observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe recovered airframe components included the tail rotor gearbox, tail rotor blades, main rotor flight control jack shaft, tail rotor pedals including one removable pedal, several sections of interior panels, one section of aft left door frame (including a seatbelt), one forward seatbelt shoulder harness, all three main rotor flight control servos, hydraulic reservoir housing, several small sections of frame tubing, a small section of tail rotor flight control tubes, several small sections of main rotor gearbox housing, main rotor gearbox driveshaft bearing race, several instruments (one unidentified, compass housing, portion of the directional gyro), the warning light control box, a short section of fuel line with a portion of the fuel valve attached, a portion of the fuel cross-over fuel line, two landing light housings, a short section of a wire bundle, a section of the tail rotor guard, one V belt, and one life vest.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne forward hydraulic servo was separated from its mount. The other forward servo remained attached to the mount; however, the mount was separated from the airframe. The aft servo was separated from the airframe and was severely bent (in excess of 120°). None of the servos could be actuated by hand. The jackshaft was separated from its mount.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor assembly was recovered separately from the airframe. The pilot's side right pedal was fractured at the bearing block. The pedal was recovered separately. The pilot's side left pedal pip/quick release pin was found displaced from the adjustable pedal assembly and exhibited no damage or bending. No damage was observed to the pedal pin holes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor gearbox was separated from the tailcone. The mounting flanges on the gearbox, along with a portion of bulkhead, were fractured and exhibited signatures consistent with overload. No additional damage was noted to the gearbox. The input and output shafts rotated more than 360° by hand with no anomalies noted. Blue oil was observed in the gearbox sight gauge. The chip detector revealed no evidence of any metallic chips. The output shaft was straight. The tail rotor pitch control would not move by hand. Both tail rotor blades were bent outward 90° near the blade root, with overload fractures in the area of the bends. One blade exhibited leading edge impact damage and the tip cap was missing. The aft flex coupling was disconnected at the flex plate ears. The remaining yoke ears on the input shaft were bent 45°. The mounting hardware remained secure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor gearbox housing exhibited angular and jagged fracture surfaces. There was no evidence of any mechanical damage to the recovered inside areas of the main rotor gearbox housing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe tube sections exhibited overload signatures on all the fracture surfaces and were bent/distorted. The section of the aft rear doorframe exhibited severe wrinkling along with overload signatures on all fracture surfaces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPortions of the airframe that remained attached to the engine included the horizontal firewall, small portions of the vertical firewall, portions of the upper frame tubes, portions of the main rotor gearbox housing, and small portions of interior components. Portions of the vertical firewall and lower airframe tubes were hydro-formed tightly around the aft portion of the engine (engine is installed rear facing forward). The forward portion of the upper frame was collapsed downward and aft. The aft portion of the upper frame had a dent in the center crosstube adjacent to the clutch with no rotational scoring observed. The horizontal firewall was dented and distorted throughout. Puncture marks were observed adjacent to the forward flex plate with no apparent rotational signatures. The oil cooler and cooling panels did not exhibit any signatures of contact with the starter ring gear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the recovered engine revealed that the right magneto was separated and the alternator, entire bottom plenum, carburetor, induction pipes (partially displaced), and exhaust system were separated. The engine remained attached to the engine mount structure along with portions of the upper frame and horizontal firewall. All six cylinders remained attached. The cooling fan and lower sheave remained attached to the engine crankshaft. The upper spark plugs were removed. The crankshaft would not rotate freely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInternal examination of each cylinder using a lighted borescope revealed varying degrees of corrosion, ocean byproducts, and sea life inside. No evidence of any foreign object ingestion was observed within the cylinder combustion chamber. The rocker box covers were removed and the rocker arm areas were cleaned using compressed air. All intake and exhaust rocker arms remained in place on each cylinder. All of the intake and exhaust pushrods were intact and impact damaged. The intake and exhaust valve springs were intact on each cylinder. The No. 2 cylinder hold-down nuts were removed. Despite numerous attempts utilizing various hand tools, the cylinder could not be removed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHoles were drilled in various locations along the top part of the engine crankcase in line with the internal rotational plane of each connecting rod/cylinder. The crankcase was examined internally using a lighted borescope. The crankshaft, camshaft, and connecting rods were observed intact and undamaged. A significant amount of corrosion, ocean byproducts, and sea life was observed within the crankcase. No evidence of any mechanical damage or heat distress was observed throughout the internal area of the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accessory case was removed and examined. The internal areas of the accessory case exhibited varying degrees of corrosion, ocean byproducts, and sea life. The crankshaft gear, dowel pin and bolt were intact and secure. The accessory gears were intact and exhibited a significant amount of corrosion.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor further information, see the Video, Airframe, and Engine Examination Summary report within the public docket. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The private pilot was conducting a local flight in the helicopter with a passenger. After departing from an open field, the pilot flew along the perimeter of the field, and the passenger recalled that about halfway around the perimeter of the field, the helicopter began descending, slowly at first and then more rapidly. According to the passenger, the rotor speed increased, but the helicopter continued to descend. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGround-based video footage revealed that before it began descending, the helicopter was moving forward slowly when it yawed about 270° to the right. As it neared the ground, the helicopter again yawed to the right, completing nearly a 360° turn either immediately before or just after it contacted the ground. The helicopter came to rest on its left side. The engine continued to run after the helicopter came to rest, and the passenger shut it off.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe and engine examinations did not reveal evidence of any anomalies consistent with a pre-impact failure or malfunction. Surface wind conditions recorded at nearby airports were light and variable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration publications regarding a loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) state that in the event of a sudden, unanticipated right yaw, a pilot should apply full left pedal, simultaneously move the cyclic control forward to increase airspeed, and if altitude permits, reduce engine power. Factors that contribute to LTE are a high-power setting, which induces considerable main rotor downwash and more turbulence relative to a low power setting, and a slow forward speed, which may create variations in airflow around the tail rotor. The video footage showing a right yaw followed by a descent suggests that the pilot encountered LTE, which resulted in the 270° right yaw before the pilot was able to regain control. The additional power required by the tail rotor during the recovery reduced the power available to the main rotor and resulted in a descent that could not be arrested with the engine power available. It appeared that the pilot did not attempt to increase airspeed during the recovery, which reduced his ability to avoid impacting the ground.",
    "FactualNarrative": "FAA Advisory Circular 90-95, Unanticipated Right Yaw in Helicopters, states that loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) is a critical, low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic that can result in an uncommanded rapid yaw rate and, if not corrected, can result in a loss of control. In order to reduce the onset of LTE, a pilot should avoid out-of-ground effect (OGE) hover and high-power demand situations. In the event of a sudden, unanticipated right yaw, a pilot should apply full left pedal, simultaneously move the cyclic control forward to increase airspeed, and if altitude permits, reduce engine power. A reduction in collective pitch will aid in arresting the yaw rate, but it may cause an increase in the descent rate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21A) states that factors that contribute to LTE are a high-power setting, which induces considerable main rotor downwash and more turbulence relative to a low power setting, and a slow forward speed, which may create variations in airflow around the tail rotor. Early detection of LTE followed by immediate corrective action is key to a safe recovery. Pilots should always set themselves up when conducting any maneuver to have enough height and space available to recover in the event that LTE is encountered. - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an airworthiness certificate for the helicopter in October 1965. It was purchased by the current owner in September 2015. Helicopter maintenance records revealed that the most recent annual inspection was completed on October 1, 2016, at an airframe total time of 2,058.7 hours. At the time of the accident, the helicopter had accumulated 15.7 hours since the annual inspection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA receipt for 15.0 gallons of 100LL aviation fuel was found in the helicopter. The receipt indicated that the pilot purchased the fuel at IKW at 1218 on the day of the accident. - On October 1, 2017, at 1447 eastern daylight time, a Brantly B-2B helicopter, N2284U, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain in an open field near Midland, Michigan. The private pilot sustained fatal injuries, and the passenger sustained minor injuries. The helicopter was registered to Attitude Toys, Inc., and was operated by the pilot as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The local flight originated from the open field shortly before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEarlier in the day, the pilot flew the helicopter with a passenger from the Jack Barstow Airport (IKW), about 10 miles east-northeast of the accident site, to the open field to attend a family gathering that was taking place at a home adjacent to the field.  The passenger on this flight stated that some minor turbulence was encountered, but the flight was otherwise uneventful.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGround-based video footage depicted the helicopter as it arrived at the family gathering. As the helicopter initially approached from the east, it began a gradual descent after it cleared the tree line east of the field. As the pilot brought the helicopter to a hover near the southwest corner of the field, it yawed to the right about 45°. The helicopter then hovered momentarily before yawing to the left about 90° to a southwesterly heading. It entered a gradual descent and began to move to the left, touched down momentarily, bounced, moved aft, and touched down again. After several seconds, the pilot lifted off again and relocated the helicopter closer to the southwest corner of the field before shutting down the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe passenger on the accident flight stated that during the family gathering, he decided to take a flight around the field with the pilot. He recalled that the helicopter \"shook\" a little on takeoff. He noted that the tail of the helicopter started to \"sway\" as they flew over the house located along the east edge of the field, but the pilot steadied the helicopter. Near the northeast corner of the field, the helicopter began descending, slowly at first and then more rapidly. The rotor speed increased, but the helicopter impacted the ground and rolled onto its left side before coming to rest. He added that the engine did not quit and that he turned if off with the ignition/magneto key after the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGround-based video footage of the accident flight showed the helicopter parked on a west heading at the southwest corner of the grass field. Immediately after lifting off, the helicopter turned to the left toward the southwest and translated aft in a 4-ft hover. The helicopter became stationary in the hover for a few seconds. It then turned to a southeast heading and began to climb toward the east-northeast. As it reached the east edge of the field, the helicopter turned north to fly parallel to the perimeter road and adjacent tree line. About mid-field, the helicopter yawed to the right momentarily while the ground track appeared to continue north paralleling the road. As the helicopter reached the northeast corner of the field, it was moving forward slowly when it yawed about 270° to the right to a westerly heading. The helicopter then began a gradual descent. As it neared the ground, the helicopter yawed to the right, completing nearly a 360° turn either immediately before or just after it contacted the ground. - The Midland County Medical Examiner's Office, Midland, Michigan, conducted an autopsy of the pilot and determined that the pilot's death was due to blunt force trauma sustained in the accident. The FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology testing that identified atorvastatin at levels too low to quantify in blood and urine specimens. Atorvastatin is prescription medication used to reduce high cholesterol and is not considered to be impairing. - The surface wind at IKW was from 160° at 5 knots at 1432 and from 170° at 3 knots at 1453. The surface wind at the Mt. Pleasant Municipal Airport (MOP), Mount Pleasant, Michigan, located 11.5 miles west of the accident site, was from 160° at 5 knots at 1433 and from 100° at 5 knots at 1454. - A review of the pilot's logbook revealed that he had logged a total of 99.6 hours of flight experience in helicopters, 9.8 hours in gyrocopters, and 360.0 hours in single-engine airplanes. Of that flight time, 16.8 hours were in a Brantley B-2B helicopter with 11.5 hours as pilot-in-command. Additionally, he had logged 3.7 hours and 2.9 hours flight time in the accident helicopter within the 90-day and 30-day periods preceding the accident, respectively. - The field was about 900 ft (north to south) by 800 ft (east to west). The accident site was located at the north boundary of the field adjacent to a shallow ravine. The helicopter came to rest on its left side and was oriented on a northwesterly heading.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe and engine examinations did not reveal evidence of any anomalies consistent with a pre-impact failure or malfunction. A detailed summary of the examinations is included in the docket associated with the investigation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot  was conducting a return cross-country business flight in a helicopter. The reported winds at the time of the accident were light, and visibility was at least 10 miles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGPS  data showed that the helicopter departed about 1554 on a northwest heading toward the destination airport. The data revealed that, for the last 5 minutes of the flight, the helicopter's GPS altitude varied between 6,200 and 6,456 ft. The terrain in the area of the accident was between 6,000 and 6,400 ft, and the initial impact point was at 6,330 ft. The last recorded data at 1635  showed the helicopter about 1.5 nautical miles from the accident site at a GPS altitude of 6,456 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA person  located near the accident site reported that he saw smoke on nearby ranch property, drove in the direction of the smoke to investigate, and found the helicopter wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted terrain in open ranch land. A postcrash fire consumed most of the wreckage. All of the airplane's major components were located at the wreckage site. Ground scars and signatures were consistent with a slight, nose-low impact with terrain, and the wreckage path was about 300 ft long on a 293° heading, which was  indicative of controlled flight  into terrain.. Although the airframe and engine examinations were limited by impact and fire damage, they did not reveal evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's cell phone was recovered, and a review of the phone records revealed that, at 1612, he  called a car rental agency. An agency employee stated that she remembered the call well.   She added that she could not tell that he was in a helicopter, but that he seemed \"busy or distracted\" and that, as they were talking about a future rental and she was \"midsentence,\" the line was disconnected. Based on the available information, the pilot was likely  using his cell phone during the low-altitude flight and became distracted, which resulted in controlled flight into terrain.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The pilot's cell phone was recovered at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPhone records for the date of the accident were obtained. A review of the records revealed that the pilot placed a call at 1607; the call lasted only 3 seconds.  About 1612, the pilot repeated the telephone call, which was to a car rental agency, this time the call lasted for 1 minute and 47 seconds.  The agency employee was interviewed by an FAA inspector several days after the accident. The clerk reported that she remembered the call well, and that she knew the pilot, because he often rented a car from the agency. She added that she could not tell that he was in a helicopter but that he seemed \"busy or distracted.\" She added that, as they were talking about a future rental and was in \"mid-sentence,\" when the call was disconnected. - The helicopter was a Bell 206L-3, which has a two-bladed main rotor system and was powered by a single Allison (Rolls-Royce) 250-C30P turboshaft engine. A review of the helicopter's maintenance records revealed that the helicopter was maintained under the manufacturer's maintenance inspection program and that its last inspection was completed on June 6, 2017. At the time of the inspection, the helicopter had 8,798.7 total flight hours, and the engine had 7,956.1 hours and 7,623 cycles. - On September 16, 2017, about 1635 mountain daylight time, a Bell 206L-3 helicopter, N213TV, impacted terrain near Ancho, New Mexico. The pilot, sole occupant, was fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to LIN Television Corporation, Providence, Rhode Island, and operated  by WQRE, TV 13, Albuquerque, New Mexico, as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 business fight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which originated about 1554 from Roswell International Air Center Airport (ROW), Roswell, New Mexico, destined for Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ), Albuquerque, New Mexico.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe day before the accident the pilot had previously flown from ABQ to ROW to conduct a news story in the Carlsbad, New Mexico area, and then spent the night in Roswell before the return flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA person   located near the accident site reported that he saw smoke and drove over to investigate.  The person found the helicopter wreckage and notified local authorities of the crash. He did not know the time of the crash, but speculated that it happened between 1600 and 1700.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Garmin Aera 796 GPS unit was found at the accident site. A review of the flight track from the GPS unit, revealed that the helicopter departure and northwest heading towards Albuquerque. The flight track was a straight line and started at a GPS altitude of 3,681 ft. For about the last 5 minutes of the flight track, the helicopter's GPS altitude varied between 6,200 and 6,456 ft, the last recorded altitude. The ground elevation and surrounding terrain near the accident site varied between 6,000 and 6,400 ft; the elevation at the initial impact point was 6,330 ft. The last recorded data showed the helicopter about 1.5 nm from the accident site. - The Office of the Medical Investigator, Albuquerque, New Mexico, conducted an autopsy on the pilot. The cause of death was determined to be blunt trauma.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, conducted toxicological testing. The testing was negative for ethanol and tested drugs. The specimens were not tested for cyanide and carbon monoxide. - There were no weather reporting stations in the vicinity of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest  automated weather observation station to the accident site located at ROW, 69 nm east-southeast, at 1551, reported  wind from the northeast at 3 mph, 10 miles visibility, a partly cloudy sky, temperature 71° F, dew point 544° F, and an altimeter setting of 26.30 inches of mercury (Hg).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe  automated weather observation station located at  ABQ, 80 nm northwest of the accident site, at 1552 reported wind from the east-southeast at 9 mph, 10 miles visibility, a partly cloudy sky, temperature 66° F, dew point 49° F, and an altimeter setting of 24.70 inches of mercury. - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with airplane single and multiengine land and instrument airplane ratings, a commercial rotorcraft certificate with a helicopter rating, and a flight instructor certificate for rotorcraft helicopter.  He also held a remote pilot certificate. His second-class Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate was issued on April 6, 2017, with the limitation that he must wear corrective lenses and have glasses available for near vision. At the time of the medical examination, the pilot reported that he had a total of 8,800 flight hours, and 150 hours of which were in the previous 6 months. - The on-scene examination of the wreckage found the helicopter impacted flat terrain in open ranch land. Ground scars and signatures were consistent with a slight, nose-low impact with terrain; television equipment, mounted on the bottom of the helicopter, was found near the initial impact point. The wreckage path from the initial impact point to the main wreckage was about 300 ft long on a 293° heading. All the of the helicopter's major components were located at the wreckage site. The distance from ROW to KAB is about 147 miles on a 315° heading.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVarious helicopter pieces were found along, and on either side of the wreckage path, including fractured sections of the landing gear skids, left door, anti-torque pedals, and pieces of the bottom fuselage. The forward cross skid tube was found just beyond the initial impact point. The aft cross skid tube was found slightly right of, and about 200 ft beyond, the main wreckage. The main wreckage consisted of most of the main cabin, which was mostly consumed by fire, and the rotor system, including the engine, that exhibited heavy fire damage. The vertical fin was found about 40 ft left of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth of the main rotor blades remained attached to the main rotor hub and exhibited fractured spars outboard of the outboard doubler, consistent with overload forces. One blade exhibited a spanwise bend opposite the direction of rotation. The other blade's outboard section remained connected to its inboard section by a bent trailing edge strip. The blade spar was also bent about 3 ft from the tip, and the tip was damaged. The main hydraulic servos located on the cabin roof were relatively intact and exhibited fire sooting and impact damage. Control connections from the input lever arms to the servo valve inputs were intact for all three main rotor servos. The flight controls between the cockpit and the servos were consumed by fire; therefore, control continuity to the main rotor or tail rotor controls could not be confirmed. Pieces of fractured control tubes, consistent with overload forces, along with melted remnants of control tubes were found. The cyclic control stick, was found fractured with two  large pieces and located in the wreckage path.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor controls exhibited extensive impact and fire damage. Both sets of rotor pedals had separated from the airframe and were found near the beginning of the wreckage path. Most of the fuel system was consumed by fire. The boost pump plate and boost pumps had separated from the airframe belly structure due to impact forces and were found in the wreckage path, prior to the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe turboshaft engine exhibited heavy impact and fire damage. The engine had separated from its engine mounts and remained attached to the airframe by two oil lines. Several blades on the 1st-stage compressor exhibited impact damage to the leading edge and was bent in the opposite the direction of rotation. N1 and N2 drive continuity was established.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe examinations of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The purpose of the flight was to provide an orientation/pleasure flight to the passenger, who was scheduled to perform in a concert on the airport later that evening. Several minutes after takeoff, the pilot reported over the airport UNICOM frequency that he was unable to control engine rpm with throttle inputs. He reported that he could \"roll\" the twist-grip; however, there was no corresponding change in engine power when he did so.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree helicopter flight instructors, one a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, one an FAA designated examiner, and a company flight instructor, joined the conversation on the radio to discuss with the pilot remedial actions and landing options. These options included a shallow, power-on approach to a run-on landing, or a power-off, autorotational descent to landing. The instructors encouraged the pilot to perform the run-on landing, but the pilot reported that a previous run-on landing attempt was unsuccessful. He then announced that he would shut down the engine and perform an autorotation, which he said was a familiar procedure that he had performed numerous times in the past. The instructors stressed to the pilot multiple times that he should delay the engine shutdown and autorotation entry until the helicopter was over the runway surface.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVideo footage from a vantage point nearly abeam the approach end of the runway showed the helicopter about 1/4 to 1/2 mile south of the runway as it entered a descent profile consistent with an autorotation. Toward the end of the video, the descent profile steepened and the rate of descent increased before the helicopter descended out of view. Witnesses reported seeing individual rotor blades as the main rotor turned during the latter portion of the descent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe increased angle and rate of descent and slowing of the rotor blades is consistent with a loss of rotor rpm during the autorotation. Despite multiple suggestions from other helicopter instructors that he initiate the autorotation above the runway, the pilot shut down the engine and entered the autorotation from an altitude about 950 ft above ground level between 1/4 and 1/2 mile from the end of the runway. Upon realizing that the helicopter would not reach the runway, the pilot could have landed straight ahead and touched down prior to the runway or performed a 180° turn to a field directly behind the helicopter; however, he continued the approach to the runway and attempted to extend the helicopter's glide by increasing collective pitch, an action that resulted in a decay of rotor rpm and an uncontrolled descent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage revealed evidence consistent with the two-piece throttle control tie rod assembly having disconnected in flight. The internally threaded rod attached to the bellcrank and an externally threaded rod-end bearing attached to the throttle control arm displayed damage to the three end-threads of each. The damage was consistent with an incorrectly adjusted throttle control tie rod assembly with reduced thread engagement, which led to separation of the rod end bearing from the tie rod and resulted in loss of control of engine rpm via the throttle twist grip control.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 8, 2017, about 1300 eastern daylight time, a Schweizer 269C-1 helicopter, N204HF, was substantially damaged during a collision with terrain while performing a forced landing to runway 01 at Flying W Airport (N14), Medford, New Jersey. The commercial pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The helicopter was owned by Herlihy Helicopters Inc and operated by Helicopter Flight Services under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the chief flight instructor for the operator, the purpose of the flight was to provide an orientation/pleasure flight to the passenger, who was scheduled to perform in a concert on the airport later that evening.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral minutes after takeoff, the pilot reported over the airport UNICOM frequency that he was unable to control engine rpm with throttle inputs. He reported that he could \"roll\" the twist-grip but that there was no corresponding change in engine rpm when he did so.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company flight instructor and another helicopter flight instructor, who was a designated pilot examiner (DPE), were monitoring the frequency and engaged the pilot in conversation about potential courses of action to accomplish a landing. A Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, who was also a helicopter instructor and examiner, joined the conversation on the radio.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOptions discussed included a shallow approach to a run-on landing or a power-off, autorotational descent to landing. The instructors suggested that the pilot perform the run-on landing; however, the pilot reported that a previous attempt to perform a run-on landing was unsuccessful and announced that he would stop the engine and perform a power-off autorotation. The pilot stated that this was a familiar procedure he had performed numerous times in the past. When asked over the radio by the DPE when he had last performed an autorotation to touchdown, the pilot replied that 4 months had elapsed since his most recent touchdown autorotation. Subsequent attempts to convince the pilot to attempt a run-on landing were unsuccessful.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the DPE and the FAA inspector, the pilot was advised \"multiple times\" to aim to touch down \"midfield\" and not to initiate the engine shutdown and autorotation until over the runway. According to the DPE, his last reminder to the pilot came when the helicopter was on a 2-mile final approach.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA video forwarded to the NTSB by local police was recorded from a vantage point nearly abeam the approach end of runway 01. The video showed the helicopter about 1/4 mile south of the runway as it entered a descent profile consistent with an autorotation. Toward the end of the video, the descent profile became more vertical, and the rate of descent increased before the helicopter descended out of view. No sound could be heard from the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a postaccident interview with law enforcement, the company flight instructor reported that the helicopter entered the autorotation about 950 ft above ground level (agl) and that the helicopter was quiet during its descent \"because the engine was off.\" During the descent, the rotor rpm decayed to the point where the instructor could see the individual rotor blades. The helicopter descended from view before reaching the runway threshold, and the sounds of impact were heard. Both the instructor and the FAA inspector reported that a high-pitched \"whine\" could be heard from the helicopter during the latter portion of the descent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a written statement, the flight instructor reported, \"[the pilot] began the autorotative descent, but it was not long before it became apparent it was not being executed correctly. I began to see individual blades instead of a translucent disc. His vertical speed increased while his horizontal speed became almost non-existent. The nose of the [helicopter] rolled forward. Instead of being able to see the bottom of the [helicopter]… all I could see was the cockpit glass and rotor head.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held commercial and flight instructor certificates, each with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued April 12, 2017.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExcerpts of the pilot's logbook revealed that he had logged 480.9 total hours of flight experience, of which about 300 hours were in the accident helicopter make and model. The last entry logged was for 1.2 hours in the accident helicopter on the day of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCompany training records indicated that the pilot had received the training required by the operator for employment as a flight instructor, and his last airman competency check was completed satisfactorily on April 19, 2017, in the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was a single-engine, two-seat, light utility helicopter constructed primarily of aluminum alloy and powered by an air-cooled, Lycoming HO-360-C1A, 180-horsepower engine. It was equipped with conventional collective and cyclic control sticks and tail rotor control pedals.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor was a fully articulated, three-bladed design, and the tail rotor was a two-bladed, semi-rigid, anti-torque rotor design. Power was transmitted from the engine to the rotor system through a V-belt drive, which incorporated a free-wheeling (one-way) sprag clutch, a main drive transmission, a tail rotor transmission, and shafts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA records, the helicopter was manufactured in 2000, delivered to the owner/operator, and had accrued about 7,899 total aircraft hours. Its most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on August 17, 2017, at 7,884 total aircraft hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of maintenance records revealed that the helicopter's engine was replaced with factory rebuilt or overhauled engines at the manufacturer's recommended overhaul intervals. Engine changes occurred in 2003, 2006, and most recently, on September 24, 2011.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe records reflected numerous entries regarding carburetor discrepancies. Carburetors were adjusted or removed and replaced with loaner carburetors then reinstalled following repairs. In February 2014, the carburetor was removed, sent out for repair, and reinstalled by the operator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn August 31, 2016, the operator installed a throttle control cable manufactured by McFarlane Aviation Products, as documented on an FAA Form 337. A cable from the original equipment manufacturer was not available per the operator, and the FAA approved the manufacture and installation, which required the cable's inspection at 25-hour intervals. The inspections were documented; the most recent was completed concurrent with the annual inspection conducted 15 hours before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator was interviewed during a meeting with NTSB investigators and FAA inspectors regarding the maintenance history of the accident helicopter. He was later interviewed by telephone to gain more detail about the disassembly/reassembly and rigging of the throttle during carburetor/engine changes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, when the engine was changed for overhaul, the carburetor traveled with the engine, and the throttle control arm was removed at the carburetor splined shaft. The throttle control bellcrank was removed from the front of the carburetor, and the entire throttle control system remained with the helicopter. The throttle control arm, the throttle tie rod, the throttle control bellcrank, and the throttle cable all remained attached to each other and to the helicopter. He stated that, because of this, there was no need to disconnect or adjust the throttle tie rod that connected the bellcrank and the throttle control arm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe also stated that, when a new engine was installed, the correct \"angle\" was measured for the installation of the throttle control arm on the carburetor. Adjustment of idle and mixture set screws was often required, as the carburetors were often set at the factory \"for airplanes.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen asked about the most recent installation of the throttle control cable, the operator stated that the cable was a fixed measurement and changing the cable did not change the rigging of the throttle. He said that, when the cable was changed, no throttle rigging adjustments were necessary; the cable was disconnected at the bellcrank upstream of the tie rod and throttle control arm. He repeated that the cable installation was \"plug and play\" and that no adjustments were necessary to achieve/maintain proper throttle rigging.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator was asked specifically about the throttle rigging and the nominal measurement of the tie rod during the throttle rigging procedure following the most recent engine change. He stated, \"I don't know if I did. I'm sure I did, because that's part of the procedure, but I'm not 100 percent [sure].\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the manufacturer's maintenance manual, actions that required compliance with the throttle rigging procedure included:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1. Installation of a new engine (Section 3-15, page 3-26)&#x0D;\n2. Installation of a new throttle control cable (Section 4-19, page 4-19)&#x0D;\n3. Installation of a new carburetor (Section 5-55, page 5-21)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1254, the weather recorded at South Jersey Regional Airport (VAY), 2 miles west of N14, included clear skies and wind from 260° at 13 knots gusting to 18 knots. The temperature was 21°C, and the dew point was 9°C. The altimeter setting was 30.13 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRPORT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nN14 was at 49 ft elevation and was equipped with a single runway, oriented 01/19. The operator's hangar was positioned at the south end of the field, approximately abeam the numbers for runway 01. A creek, oriented east/west, crossed about 200 ft south of the approach end of runway 01. The creek bed was lined with small trees and low brush and bisected the area between the runway and an open field immediately south of the airport.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe field was about 1,400 ft long and 300 ft wide at its narrowest point and was oriented in the same general direction as the runway. The surface was mowed grass or \"scraped\" and flattened soil.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was examined at the accident site and all major components of the helicopter were accounted for at the scene. The initial ground scar was about 10 ft before the main wreckage, which was about 220 ft from the threshold of runway 01 and aligned with the runway.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit was significantly deformed by impact damage, and the tailboom was separated at the fuselage. The engine and main transmission remained mounted in the airframe, and all main rotor blades were secured in their respective grips, which remained attached to the main rotor head and mast. The pitch-change link for the yellow rotor blade was fractured and displayed signatures consistent with overstress. Each of the three blades was bent significantly at its respective blade root. The blades showed little to no damage along their respective spans toward the blade tips, which was consistent with low rotor rpm at ground contact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was established from the individual flight controls through breaks to the main rotor head and tail rotor. The pilot's and co-pilot's throttles both moved together when the pilot's throttle was actuated by hand. The movement was limited due to damage on the pilot's collective; during the continuity check, an internal component of the pilot's collective disconnected and continuity between the two throttles was lost.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nContinuity of the throttle control cable was confirmed from the collective jackshaft to the throttle bellcrank assembly, to which it remained securely attached. The throttle bellcrank assembly was intact, but separated from its mount, which was fractured. The internally threaded portion of the two-piece throttle control tie rod was securely attached to the throttle bellcrank assembly. The internally threaded portion of the tie rod was filled with an organic material that resembled the roots in the impact crater.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDrivetrain continuity was established to the main and tail rotors. The main gearbox housing was intact and attached to the bottom of the main rotor mast and to the center frame. The main gearbox rotated freely and exhibited continuity from input to the main rotor driveshaft, and the free-wheeling (one-way) sprag clutch operated correctly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was rotated by hand at the cooling fan, and continuity was confirmed from the powertrain through the valvetrain to the accessory section. Compression was confirmed on all cylinders using the thumb method. The magnetos were removed and actuated with a drill, and spark was produced at all terminal leads. Borescope examination of each cylinder revealed signatures consistent with normal wear, with no anomalies noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor was separated from the engine, displayed impact damage, and was found near the initial ground scar. The externally-threaded portion of the two-piece throttle control tie rod was still attached to the throttle arm. The throttle and mixture arms were actuated by hand and moved smoothly through their respective ranges. The filter screen was removed and was absent of debris. The carburetor contained fuel, which appeared absent of water and debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe collective control and jackshaft assembly with the associated throttle cable and bellcrank assemblies, as well as each half of the throttle tie rod, were retained for further examination at the NTSB Materials Laboratory.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Office of Medical Examiner, County of Burlington, New Jersey, performed an autopsy on the pilot. The cause of death was listed as \"multiple injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological testing on the pilot. The results were negative for the presence of drugs and alcohol.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe throttle tie rod assembly was received separated at the threaded joint. The components were unbolted from the carburetor throttle arm and the throttle cable before receipt in the materials laboratory. The tie rod assembly consisted of an internally threaded rod attached to the bellcrank and an externally threaded rod-end bearing and jam nut attached to the throttle arm. The tie rod was separated at the threaded joint between the two pieces. The rod end jam nut was found about midway between the threaded end and the rod end bearing eye.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMagnified examinations of the externally threaded rod-end bearing threads revealed mechanical damage to the three end threads. The damage was consistent with thread-to-thread wear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVisual examination of the internal threads in the rod revealed cellulose material (wood) imbedded into the threads. After brush cleaning, damage was visible to the three end threads. The damage included pock-marks and a reduced thread flank size, consistent with vibratory thread-to-thread wear. These three threads corresponded to the three worn threads on the bearing fitting. Threads further inside the rod were bright, shiny, and undamaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnce installed, each end of the throttle tie rod remained fixed and were unable to rotate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn exemplar Schweizer 269C-1 helicopter was examined in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The rigging of the throttle control arm and throttle tie rod (4.97 inches +/- .02 inch) was confirmed, and the helicopter was started and idled at a speed about 1,000 rpm. The engine was stopped, the throttle tie rod was disconnected and adjusted to the approximate operating length of the accident tie rod (5.5 inches) and reinstalled. The engine was started and idled at a speed about 1,100 rpm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Sikorsky maintenance manual for the Schweizer 269C-1 helicopter, after rigging the throttle control system, idle speed was adjusted to its prescribed rpm range (+/-200rpm) by idle/mixture screw adjustments of the carburetor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Sikorsky maintenance manual also required a 50-hour inspection of the engine in accordance with the engine manufacturer's publications and a 100-hour inspection of the fuel control linkage. The Sikorsky flight manual required an inspection of the general engine area before each flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn November 16, 2017, Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation issued Alert Service Bulletin ASB-C1B-048 for a one-time inspection of the throttle control tie rod assembly to verify the length of throttle control tie rod assembly dimension.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nORGANIZATONAL AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner of Helicopter Flight Services held airline transport, commercial, and flight instructor certificates with multiple ratings for each. He also held a mechanic certificate with ratings for airframe, powerplant, and inspection authorization, and performed much of the maintenance of the accident helicopter, including the most recent throttle cable inspection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUS Army Hughes TH-55A (Hughes/Schweizer 269) Manual (TM 55-1520-233-10) Chapter 9, Emergency Procedures, 9-12, Throttle Failure, stated, \"If the throttle becomes inoperative in flight, continue to a landing area that will permit a shallow approach and running landing.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe manufacturer's Pilot's Flight Manual does did not contain an emergency procedure for throttle failure. An informal survey of two other manufacturers of piston-powered helicopters by the FAA inspector assigned to this accident revealed that neither published such a procedure in their flight manuals.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe US Army Training Circular (TC) 3-04.4, \"Fundamentals of Flight,\" specified the following regarding autorotations:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1-123. During powered flight, rotor drag is overcome with engine power. When the engine fails or is deliberately disengaged from the rotor system, some other force must sustain rotor RPM so controlled flight can be continued to the ground. Adjusting the collective pitch to allow a controlled descent generates this force. Airflow during helicopter descent provides energy to overcome blade drag and turn the rotor. When the helicopter descends in this manner, it is in a state of autorotation. In effect, the aviator exchanges altitude at a controlled rate in return for energy to turn the rotor at a RPM [an rpm] that provides aircraft control and a safe landing. Helicopters have potential energy based on their altitude above the ground. As this altitude decreases, potential energy is converted into kinetic energy used in turning the rotor. Aviators use this kinetic energy to slow the rate of descent to a controlled rate and affect a smooth touchdown.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCircle of Action&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1-139. The circle of action is a point on the ground that has no apparent movement in the pilot's field of view (FOV) during a steady-state autorotation. The circle of action would be the point of impact if the pilot applied no deceleration, initial pitch, or cushioning pitch during the last 100 feet of autorotation. Depending on the amount of wind present and the rate and amount of deceleration and collective application, the circle of action is usually two or three helicopter lengths short of the touchdown point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLast 50 to 100 Feet&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1-140. It can be assumed autorotation ends at 50 to 100 feet and landing procedures then begin. To execute a power-off landing for rotary-wing aircraft, an aviator exchanges airspeed for lift by decelerating the aircraft during the last 100 feet. When executed correctly, deceleration is applied and timed so rate of descent and forward airspeed are minimized just before touchdown. At about 10 to 15 feet, this energy exchange is essentially complete. Initial pitch application occurs at 10 to 15 feet. This is used to trade some of the rotor energy to slow the rate of descent prior to cushioning. The primary remaining control input is application of collective pitch to cushion touchdown. Because all helicopter types are slightly different, aviator experience in that particular aircraft is the most useful tool for predicting useful energy exchange available at 100 feet and the appropriate amount of deceleration and collective pitch needed to execute the exchange safely and land successfully.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Advisory Circular (AC) 61-140, \"Autorotation Training - Predominant Cause of Accidents/Incidents,\" states:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of NTSB reportable accidents and incidents during autorotation training/instruction indicates that the predominant probable cause is failure to maintain main rotor .... rpm (Nr) and airspeed within the Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) or pilot's operating handbook (POH) specified range, resulting in an excessive and unrecoverable rate of descent.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Helicopter Handbook: \"If too much collective pitch is applied too early during the final stages of the autorotation, the kinetic energy may be depleted, resulting in little or no cushioning effect available. This could result in a hard landing with corresponding damage to the helicopter.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe US Army Hughes TH-55A Manual (TM 55-1520-233-10) states in Chapter 9, Emergency Procedures, 9-12, Engine Failure – Cruise, \"Collective pitch should never be applied to reduce rpm for extending glide distance because of the reduction in rpm available for use during touchdown. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was conducting an air ambulance flight to transport a patient to another hospital located about 130 nautical miles away. About 8 minutes after takeoff, at a GPS altitude of about 2,500 ft mean sea level (msl) and a groundspeed of about 120 knots, the helicopter began a left turn toward the south. Although the precise timing and order of events could not be determined, the No. 2 engine experienced a bearing seizure; the engine continued to run. This likely resulted in several cockpit indications described below. It is likely that the pilot then errantly shutdown the No. 1 engine and continued to fly for a brief period utilizing the No. 2 engine. About 1 minute after the left turn began, the last data point was recorded, which indicated that the helicopter was at a GPS altitude of about 1,200 ft msl and a groundspeed of 75 knots. It is likely that the No. 2 engine subsequently lost all power. The helicopter then impacted a shallow turf drainage pathway between fields of tall grass on a farm, and a postcrash fire ensued, which consumed most of the helicopter structure. The lack of any ground scars leading toward or away from the main wreckage indicated that the helicopter was in a near&#x1E;vertical descent before impacting the ground. One rotor blade was found intact resting in undisturbed 8-ft-tall grass, consistent with little or no rotation of the main rotor system. Neither engine exhibited damage consistent with rotation at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDetailed examination of the No. 2 engine revealed that its gas generator shaft rear bearing was seized and damaged. Specifically, all the roller elements were flattened and none of the roller elements would rotate. Several bearing components showed damage consistent with friction between the seized rollers and the inner race and ensuing overheating. These signatures were not observed in the No. 1 engine gas generator shaft rear bearing. The lack of rotation of the roller pins and the damage to the gas generator spool indicated that the No. 2 engine’s rear bearing had failed during the accident flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe No. 2 engine’s oil return strainer/chip detector was partially obstructed with crystalline carbon-like and metallic debris, and debris was found downstream of the strainer in the oil pump inlet, consistent with some oil flow through the normal path exiting the rear bearing housing. The No. 2 engine 3-way deck fitting was unobstructed; however, it had been exposed to significant heat that could have decomposed the elastomeric tubing and any excess shrink tubing material, if it had been present and blocking the fitting’s ports. Excess shrink tubing material was found obstructing the ports in the No. 1 engine 3-way deck fitting. No liquid oil remnants were found on engine No. 2 components to indicate that engine oil had migrated through the engine’s main air path and through the exhaust. Had oil been present, it might have been consumed by the postimpact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe root cause of the No. 2 engine’s bearing failure could not be determined due to the damage it sustained while continuing to operate before impact, and due to impact and subsequent post-crash fire damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccident Sequence and Cockpit Indications&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA lack of recorded flight data precluded determining the precise timing, duration, and order of each event that likely occurred during the accident flight, to include the cockpit indications provided to the pilot; however, based on available evidence, it is possible that the pilot may have encountered the following indications during the final minutes of the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Chip Detector Indication&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMetallic debris found in the No. 2 engine oil return strainer/chip detector downstream of the rear bearing housing likely resulted in an ENG CHIP message on the helicopter’s Caution and Advisory Display (CAD). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter’s flight manual (FLM) listed two procedures for engine chip detection: either shut down the affected engine or slowly reduce power to idle on the affected engine and monitor the engine parameters. The second option was intended to allow the pilot to potentially use the affected engine during landing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Parameter Discrepancy Indication&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA cockpit display simulation prepared by the airframe manufacturer and an analysis prepared by the engine manufacturer revealed that, during the degradation of the rear bearing, the No. 2 engine experienced an increase in turbine outlet temperature (TOT). This likely triggered an engine parameter discrepancy (ENG PA DIS) caution message that would have appeared in both the left (engine 1) and right (engine 2) columns on the CAD, indicating that a discrepancy was detected in one of the parameters between engine Nos. 1 and 2. The CAD message would not have indicated which parameter had a discrepancy; however, the affected parameter’s numeric value (TOT in this case) would change from white to yellow on the First Limit Indicator (FLI), described below. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FLM procedure for the ENG PA DIS message was, “do not try and match needles, avoid using maximum power, compare the numeric values on the FLI to verify the affected parameter, and land as soon as practicable.” The FLM procedures did not request the pilot to shut down the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOther Indications&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditional caution messages may have also appeared on the CAD. If a difference in torque between the two engines was detected at greater than 15%, a VAR NR caution message would appear in the center “MISC” column of the CAD, advising the pilot to manually match the engines’ torque values. If a difference in N1 between the two engines of greater that 10% was detected, the ENG SPLIT caution message would appear in both engine columns of the CAD. The FLM procedure for an ENG SPLIT caution message was to adjust the collective lever to one-engine inoperative (OEI) limits or below, turn off bleed air consumers, and analyze engine conditions. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFirst Limit Indicator Display During Bearing Failure &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA simulation of the primary engine display instrument, the first limit indicator (FLI), revealed that as the bearing degraded, the FLI might have presented data in a way that was unfamiliar to the pilot, possibly causing confusion. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSpecifically, as the bearing failed, the FLI needle for the No. 2 engine would have changed from indicating torque (TRQ), to indicating turbine outlet temperature (TOT) due to a sudden rise in TOT in the No. 2 engine. Such a switch would have been unusual, because the needles normally reflect TOT during engine start only. The change in the position of the No. 2 FLI needle would have resulted in a large split between both needles. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn normal cruise flight, with the FLI needles both representing TRQ, a large split during cruise flight would indicate a difference in TRQ between the engines; thus, the pilot may have erroneously thought that the split was showing that the No. 1 engine was producing much less TRQ than the No. 2 engine, which might have contributed to his decision to shut down the No. 1 engine. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FLI should have indicated, in the numeric section of the display, that the No. 2 needle was indicating TOT, and if appropriate, that the No. 2 engine’s TOT had reached its limit. Despite the split needles, the numeric values for each engine’s TRQ may have at least initially been similar, which could be confirmed by cross-checking the triple tachometer located above the FLI on the instrument panel. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe specific condition of the FLI needles showing one engine limited by TRQ and the other engine limited by TOT during cruise flight was not reviewed or practiced as part of the operator’s or the helicopter manufacturer’s training programs. However, depending on operating conditions, the engines could be limited by TRQ, N1, or TOT, which was covered in those training programs, as were engine failures and typical “needle split” conditions that occur during an engine failure. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nShutdown of No. 1 Engine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage at the accident site revealed that the No. 1 engine twist-grip throttle control in the cockpit was found in the OFF position (which matched the indicator on the No. 1 engine fuel control unit). In order for the control to be placed in this position, the pilot would have had to press a release button on the grip to rotate it below the IDLE position. The No. 2 engine twist-grip throttle control was found in the FLIGHT position (which matched the indicator on the No. 2 engine fuel control unit). This evidence indicated that the pilot likely shut down the No. 1 engine and that the helicopter continued to fly for some time with power being provided only by the No. 2 engine. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter’s FLM there were three events that might prompt a pilot to shut down an engine in flight; an engine fire, an engine CHIP indication, or low engine oil pressure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt is possible that the pilot inadvertently shut down the engine No 1. in response to the No. 2 engine ENG CHIP caution. However, the available evidence did not indicate why he might have chosen to shut down an engine rather than reduce the engine power to idle. It is also possible that the pilot erroneously shut down the No. 1 engine after receiving one or more of the above-mentioned cockpit indications, which may have been unexpected and/or confusing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSingle Engine Performance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPerformance calculations indicated that, given the takeoff weight and ambient conditions, the helicopter would have been able to fly to a suitable landing location with only one engine operative without exceeding maximum continuous power. However, the helicopter would not have been able to hover to land, which would have required the pilot to make a running landing onto a smooth, firm surface. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe GPS tracking data from the helicopter were not recorded at a sufficient frequency to determine the helicopter's track, speed, and descent profile before impact. As a result, the investigation could not determine if the pilot maneuvered for an immediate landing or a diversion to an alternate location, nor could it be determined if the pilot established the appropriate speed for a one-engine-inoperative (OEI) condition. However, witness reports indicated that the helicopter appeared to be in control with the main and tail rotors turning at an estimated altitude of about 300 ft above the ground with little or no forward speed just before the helicopter’s rapid final descent. Thus, it is possible that the pilot was attempting an emergency OEI landing when the loss of power in the No. 2 engine occurred. While the helicopter’s flight manual provided a procedure for a dual engine failure, it did not provide autorotation performance data to compute height and speed combinations that should result in a successful autorotation with both engines inoperative. Nevertheless, the helicopter might have been at an altitude that was too low and/or an airspeed that was too slow to allow for a successful autorotative landing when the loss of power in the No. 2 engine occurred. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAssessment of Potential Fire in No. 2 Engine Compartment&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFilaments in all four bulbs in the No. 2 engine fire warning light were found stretched, consistent with their illumination at the time of impact. Each engine’s electrically operated airframe fuel shutoff valve was found in the open position. Because each valve would close if its respective fire indication button was pressed, the pilot likely did not press either fire indication button. This suggests that the pilot did not inadvertently shut down the No. 1 engine in response to a potential No. 2 engine fire indication, and that the No. 1 engine shutdown occurred at some point before the illumination of the No. 2 engine fire warning light. With the No. 1 engine already shut down, the pilot would likely not have pressed the No. 2 engine fire indication button, because it would have automatically shut down the helicopter’s remaining source of engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough witnesses reported that during the final moments of the accident that smoke had been trailing behind the helicopter that was black and/or blue in color, the investigation could not determine if the origin of the smoke was from an active engine compartment fire, engine oil exposed to hot engine components, poor combustion in the No.2 engine, and/or another source. Although a plume of smoke can emanate from an engine’s exhaust if the engine is shutdown using the engine fire button, the open airframe fuel shutoff valves suggest that neither fire button was pressed. The investigation could also not determine if any smoke was present in the cockpit and if that could have affected the pilot's visibility inside or outside of the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough reports of erroneous fire indications in BK117 C2 helicopters have occurred in the past, based on the fire indication light bulb filament stretching, and the multiple witness reports of smoke emanating from the helicopter in flight, it is possible that an in-flight fire occurred in the No.2 engine compartment; however, the impact damage and post-crash fire precluded a conclusive determination of the presence and origin of an in-flight fire. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe postaccident condition of the No.2 engine and the rotor system indicated that prior to impact, the No.2 engine lost all power. The cause of the ultimate complete loss of power in the No. 2 engine could not be determined. Although it is reasonable to consider that it may have been the result of effects of the rear bearing failure, or as a consequence of an unmitigated in-flight fire, there was insufficient evidence to conclude if or how either of these conditions led to the complete loss of power in the No. 2 engine. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPossible Indication of Impending Bearing Failure&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of records from engine oil tests performed in the 9 months preceding the accident revealed that metallic contaminants were detected in the No. 2 engine oil at levels considerably higher than in the No. 1 engine. Although the contaminant levels did not exceed those specified by the engine manufacturer to warrant action, the contamination levels fluctuated significantly between tests. In one case, the concentration of iron, which could be an indicator of impending bearing failure, doubled between tests. The oil test evaluation procedures did not include steps to monitor trends of contaminant concentration levels over time. If the engine manufacturer’s procedures had included appropriate trend monitoring criteria, the impending bearing failure in the No. 2 engine might have been detected and mitigated.&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Flight Data Monitoring Device&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a North Flight Data Systems OuterLink Voice and Video Recorder, which was designed to capture video, audio, and parametric flight data. The recorder was installed voluntarily by the operator as a flight data monitoring device.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe device was found in the wreckage and was sent to the NTSB’s Vehicle Recorders Division. The device’s memory card was not damaged, but no usable data could be retrieved, including recordings of the accident flight. The manufacturer of the device indicated that its internal replaceable battery might have expired, which would have prevented new data from being properly stored on the memory card.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped, and was not required to be equipped, with a crashworthy flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnomalous Fire Indications&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of AMC records revealed two reports of spurious engine fire indications in other MBB BK117 C2 helicopters, one in July and the other in October 2017. In those events, the fire light illuminated either intermittently or solidly, and was accompanied by the aural warning. No evidence of an actual fire was found in either case. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Oil Analysis Program&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAMC’s helicopter maintenance program included a spectrometric oil analysis program (SOAP). Oil samples were taken from each helicopter engine every 100 hours and sent to a laboratory for analysis. The last six laboratory reports, from November 2016 to August 2017, for each engine on the accident helicopter revealed that the No. 2 engine had consistently higher concentrations of iron than the No.1 engine. Iron is the primary constituent of bearings and gears. Specifically, examination of the laboratory results for the No. 2 engine revealed that the concentration values for iron (corrected for fluctuations in oil quantity) ranged from 2.25 to 6.75 parts per million (ppm), with the concentration values increasing and decreasing over time and nearly doubling from 3.20 to 6.20 ppm between February and May 2017 (the helicopter had accrued 91 flight hours between these two samples). The laboratory results during the same time period for the No. 1 engine ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 ppm. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine manufacturer’s alert criteria to provide closer monitoring (such as trending analysis of SOAP results) or to perform more frequent inspections was 7.5 ppm for corrected iron concentration values. Thus, the results for the No. 2 engine were below the engine manufacturer's alert criteria.&#x0D;\nAMC considers adding oil as normal service and does not require tracking the amount added in the record of maintenance. Mechanics may include the information in the maintenance logbook but are not required to do so, and pilots can be trained and authorized to add engine oil as well but are not required to do so or record the amount. A comparison of the SOAP test sheets with the aircraft flight logbook entries for oil additions, the quantities of oil added did not match. Accurate SOAP analyses require an accounting of oil added between successive oil samples taken for testing.&#x0D;\n - Maintenance &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was maintained by the operator using a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Approved Aircraft Inspection Program. According to AMC maintenance records, the helicopter’s most recent 30-hour engine inspection was completed on August 15, 2017. At that time, the helicopter and both engines had accrued a total of 2,673 hours. Several routine maintenance and inspection tasks were completed on both engines during a ten-day period prior to the accident which include such items as engine power assurance checks, compressor wash, and zonal inspections; no unusual finds were reported. The most recent daily inspection occurred on the morning of the accident at which time, the helicopter and engines had accrued a total of about 2,714 hours.&#x0D;\nAccording to AMC, in addition to scheduled inspections, a daily airworthiness check of the helicopter was performed by a mechanic. A review of all engine and engine indication related maintenance records for the 6 months preceding the accident revealed no discrepancies. &#x0D;\nAMC’s maintenance program specified the time between overhaul (TBO) for different engine components; the engine was normally not overhauled completely at one time. The TBO for the gas generator section was every 3,600 hours; the gas generator sections for the accident engines were not due to be overhauled for another 886 hours. Review of the maintenance records for the last 9 months prior to the accident revealed that AMC conducted multiple routine and scheduled gas generator oil system tasks which included rear bearing lubrication inspections, oil line inspections, and electric magnetic plugs inspections with no anomies reported. The engine manufacturer's specification for an engine oil change was every 800 hours. Maintenance records indicated that the operator replaced the engine oil at least every 300 hours. In addition, the Fuel Control Units (FCU) of both engines were last checked in mid-August with no anomalies reported. &#x0D;\nIn the period February 22nd, 2017 through March 31, 2017 (at 2,406 hours), both engines were removed from the airframe during a major helicopter maintenance.&#x0D;\nOn May 22nd, 2017 (at 2,521 hours), a flight crew reported an electrical burning smell in the cabin. Maintenance troubleshooting did not reveal any discrepancies. &#x0D;\nEngine Procedures&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEach engine was equipped with four chip detectors, two of which were electric, to alert the pilot with a cockpit indication (ENG CHIP) when a metal particle is detected in the engine oil. One of the electric detectors was positioned in a strainer downstream of the rear bearing housing. The cockpit indication for a chip detection is a master caution light, an audible gong, and an amber caution message on the caution and advisory display panel showing the chip detection and the engine that was affected. The helicopter was optionally equipped with a pulse chip detector, or “fuzz burn” system. This system can clear small insignificant debris from the chip detector contacts by applying an electrical current to the detector to ‘burn’ the debris. According to the BK117 C-2 Flight Manual (FLM), with this system installed, the first procedure after receiving an ENG CHIP indication, is to depress the FUZZ BURN switch for 1 second, and monitor engine parameters. If the ENG CHIP indication extinguishes, no further action is required. If the ENG CHIP indication occurs again later in flight, the fuzz burn system may be activated a second time. If the ENG CHIP indication does not extinguish, the emergency procedures included two options for resolving the issue: either (1) perform a single-engine emergency shutdown or (2) reduce the affected engine slowly to idle power, and monitor indications. The FLM indicated that the second option would enable a pilot to use the affected engine for landing, as long as engine parameters remained within limits. A decision for this option requires the pilot to continuously monitor engine parameters N1 (gas generator speed), TOT (turbine outlet temperature), TRQ (engine torque), oil pressure and temperature, and be prepared for immediate engine shutdown.&#x0D;\nAccording to the Airbus Helicopters training content and the FLM, emergency procedures in bold face with a grey background are generally memory items which shall be performed immediately without necessity of consulting either the FLM or the pilot’s checklist. The helicopter shall be operated in compliance with the certified limitations making sure that even if one engine became inoperative (OEI), the helicopter could safely continue the flight and there would be enough time for the pilot to identify and allocate the technical issue. Mission preparation requires anticipating all engines operating (AEO) and OEI performance according to the mission environment. The FLM also prescribes that if one engine became inoperative, the pilot must determine if the situation will allow for OEI flight, and if not, to land as soon as possible. Conditions that affect the ability of the helicopter to sustain OEI flight include the helicopter’s weight, the outside air temperature, and the pressure altitude.&#x0D;\nA review of weight and balance records revealed that, at the time of takeoff, the accident helicopter weighed between 7,524 and 7,590 pounds. A review of performance calculations revealed that, based on that weight range and the ambient temperature, the helicopter had an OEI climb rate of about 300 ft per minute at a speed of 65 knots, with maximum continuous power, at an altitude of 1,000 ft. The review of performance calculations also revealed that the helicopter did not have enough power to hover to land with one operating engine. The FLM indicated that landing in these conditions would require, in part, an approach speed of 65 knots (reduced to 40 knots at an altitude of 50 ft), necessitating a \"running\" landing in which the helicopter would land with some forward airspeed. An FLM height-velocity diagram, which was applicable for OEI landings to a smooth, firm surface, indicated that, for the accident helicopter’s takeoff weight and the ambient temperature, a successful OEI landing could be performed from an altitude of about 180 ft above ground level and with no initial forward speed. The FLM did not provide a height-velocity diagram with guidance for autorotation conditions with both engines inoperative.&#x0D;\nAccording to the FLM, if the engine fire detection system sensed heat, an engine fire indication button would illuminate on the warning unit for the affected engine. The warning unit indication is arranged with the fire indication light for the No. 1 engine on the left edge of the unit, and the light for the No. 2 engine on the right edge of the unit. The fire detection initiating the illumination on the warning panel is accompanied by a warning bell. The FLM procedure for a fire indication includes: establish OEI flight by reducing the airspeed below 100 knots and pressing the fire indication button, which would automatically close the airframe fuel shutoff valve for that engine and cause the engine to shut down by fuel starvation. According to Safran, this can result in a plume of smoke from the engine exhaust. The engine fire detection system did not have the capability to sense smoke.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVehicle and Engine Multifunction Display&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a Vehicle and Engine Multifunction Display (VEMD), which is an electronic display in the center of the helicopter’s instrument panel and is the pilot's primary reference for engine power management. The central focus on the VEMD is the First Limit Indicator (FLI) displaying an analogue indication (tachometer-like) of the limiting parameter associated with the helicopter engine primary limitations. The dial scale of the analogue display is arbitrary and does not represent a percentage value.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe VEMD’s FLI presents a needle dial gauge (needle “I” is for the No. 1 engine, and needle “II” is for the No. 2 engine) and digital numeric values for engine torque (TRQ), turbine outlet temperature (TOT), and gas generator rotational speed (N1) for each engine. Figure 1 depicts the FLI and describes the display’s various indications.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 - First limit indicator. (Information from rotorcraft flight manual.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe needles can represent TRQ, TOT, or N1, depending on which of these parameters is the closest to its operating limitation for each engine given the conditions at the time. For example, during cruise flight on the day of the accident, the needle for each engine (operating normally) would have corresponded to torque. In normal operation, both engines would have also remained torque matched by an automated variable rotorspeed and torque matching system (VARTOMS). In this case, the “first limit” for both engines would be torque. The first limiting parameter is the parameter that is closest to its limit and does not mean that parameter has reached a limit. For example, as the pilot adds power, the engines would eventually reach one of the torque operating limits before reaching any of the turbine outlet temperature or gas generator speed limits. In different ambient conditions, such as operation at higher pressure altitudes, the first limiting parameter can instead be N1. Normally, both engines are limited by the same parameter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe needles do not depict the value of the first-limited parameter (the scale inside the arc, numbered 2 through 14 in figure 1, is unitless, and standardized for comparison of the three limiting parameters) but rather the relationship of the parameter to several different limits that are shown on the outside of the arc as colored lines and symbols. These limits, including those for the OEI condition, are always displayed. The digital numeric values arranged vertically on the left side of the display show the values of TRQ, TOT, and N1 for the No. 1 engine; the numbers on the right side show the values for the No. 2 engine. These numbers, and the white boxes showing which parameter is currently closest to a limit for each engine, are also always displayed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nShould an engine be first limited by torque, its needles would depict engine torque with the various torque limits shown on the outside of the dial arc as red and yellow lines and circles. The white boxes that indicate the first-limit parameter for each engine (which in the example on Figure 1 is TRQ for both engines) also indicate that the respective needle is displaying that particular parameter. The needles in figure 1 show the No. 2 engine TRQ is in the yellow “AEO takeoff power range” and that the No. 1 engine TRQ is at the red “AEO max. takeoff power” limit. Additionally, the numeric value for the No. 1 engine TRQ is underlined with a red bar, indicating that it has reached the TRQ limit and is arriving to the transient range (meaning it can safely operate at that torque for a limited amount of time). &#x0D;\nIf both engines are operating normally in cruise flight, both needles would indicate TRQ and would be positioned closely to one another with the same or about the same value, indicating that each engine is producing about the same amount of power. Small deviations in TRQ can be addressed manually by the pilot. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA large deviation, or “split,” between the needles during flight would indicate an unusual situation, which may be associated with an issue with the torque matching system (VARTOMS), other disparate conditions between the two engines (not necessarily due to a malfunction), or in an engine failure. If a large split between needles is visible, it would be one of the indications that a pilot could use to confirm the failure of an engine and determine which engine had failed. Airbus Helicopters performed a simulation to determine what would happen with a split between the needles if they were not indicating the same parameter for each engine, as discussed later in this report. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTriple Tachometer&#x0D;\nLocated above the FLI, is a triple tachometer which is an analog gauge with three needles. One needle depicts the main rotor RPM, the other two depict the power turbine speed (N2) in percent of the respective engine. This instrument can aid the pilot in determining which engine may be experiencing a problem, if the problem results in a variance in one of the engine’s power turbine speed. Additionally, an aural pulsed tone warning occurs and the ROTOR RPM light will illuminate on the warning unit when the rotor RPM is less than 95%.&#x0D;\n - On September 8, 2017, about 1120 eastern daylight time, an Airbus (formerly Eurocopter) Deutschland GmbH MBB BK117 C-2 helicopter, N146DU, powered by two Safran Helicopter (SafranHE) Arriel 1 E2 turboshaft engines, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident near Hertford, North Carolina. The commercial pilot, two flight nurses, and one patient were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 air ambulance flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Air Methods Corporation (AMC), the operator of the flight, the pilot and both medical crewmembers departed at 0827 on the morning of the flight from their base at Johnston Regional Airport (JNX), Smithfield, North Carolina, for Elizabeth City Regional Airport (ECG), Elizabeth City, North Carolina, for refueling. The helicopter arrived at ECG about 0924 and departed for Sentara Albemarle Medical Center Heliport (NC98) in Elizabeth City about 1011. The helicopter arrived at NC98 about 1022, after which the patient was boarded onto the helicopter. About 1108, the pilot radioed the Duke Life Flight operations center and advised that that the helicopter was departing for Duke University North Heliport (NC92), which was 130 nautical miles (nm) away, with 2 hours of fuel and four people aboard. There were no further communications from the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGPS tracking data transmitted from the helicopter every 60 seconds showed that it departed NC98 to the northwest, climbed to a GPS altitude of about 1,000 ft mean sea level (msl), and turned west. The helicopter then climbed to a GPS altitude of about 2,500 ft msl and continued on a westerly track at a groundspeed of about 120 knots. About 8 minutes after takeoff, the helicopter began a turn toward the south. When the transmitted data ended about 1 minute later, the helicopter was traveling on a southeasterly track at a GPS altitude of about 1,200 ft msl and a groundspeed of 75 knots. The helicopter wreckage was located about 15 nm west of ECG.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses reported observing smoke trailing behind the helicopter while it was in flight. Some of these witnesses described the smoke as \"heavy\" and \"dark,\" and others reported the color as \"black,\" \"dark blue,\" and \"blue.\" One witness reported that the smoke was coming from under the rotor. Another witness reported that smoke was trailing about 20 ft behind the helicopter in “one single wide streak…like a truck would leave when it is burning oil, blue, not black”. One witness reported that the helicopter appeared to be \"hovering\" at an altitude of about 300 ft (based on its height relative to a nearby windmill) just before it descended straight down. Another witness reported hearing a \"popping noise\" and observing the helicopter turning left and right and then descending quickly. This witness further reported that the helicopter appeared \"in control\" with the rotors turning before he lost sight of it.&#x0D;\n - The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Raleigh, North Carolina, performed an autopsy of the pilot. His cause of death was blunt force injuries. &#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and all tested-for drugs.&#x0D;\nThe autopsy reports for the pilot, the medical crewmembers, and the patient did not note whether soot or smoke particles were found in their throats or respiratory systems.&#x0D;\n - The pilot had been employed with AMC since August 2009. He was the lead pilot and the safety officer at AMC’s JNX base and an AMC maintenance test pilot in the BK117 C2 helicopter. He was also current and qualified on the twin-engine Airbus EC135 helicopter, in which he had accrued 1,100 hours of total flight experience. Before his employment with AMC, the pilot flew twin-engine Sikorsky UH-60 helicopters for the US Army, accruing about 2,300 flight hours, and the EC135 helicopter for another helicopter air ambulance provider. &#x0D;\nAMC training records indicated that the pilot had completed all required training with no deficiencies. During the pilot’s most recent recurrent training and checkride for the BK117 C2, the pilot performed one-engine-inoperative (OEI) flight procedures and a simulated OEI landing. Recurrent training typically included autorotations, which were practiced to a power recovery at a 3-ft hover, but no autorotations were specifically documented in the pilot’s recurrent training records. At the time of the accident, AMC did not have a BK117 C2 simulator training program, which would allow for practice autorotations to touchdown. According to his training records, the pilot was familiar and current with the indications associated with autorotation and OEI conditions as well as for the behavior of the aircraft. (AMC had been developing a BK117 C2 simulator training program at the time of the accident, which was subsequently implemented). Simulated OEI landings were performed in the aircraft by utilizing power limits representative of OEI performance. Engine fire light procedures were discussed during the training and were the subject of oral questions during the checkride.&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s most recent EC135 simulator training included OEI recoveries, OEI landings, and engine fire light procedures. The indications and procedures in the EC135 are similar to what is seen and performed in the EC145.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's work schedule included 12-hour workdays from 0800 to 2000, with a 6-days-on/6-days-off format. The accident occurred on the third flight leg of the second day of the pilot’s work schedule.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to his wife, the pilot had no issues with his sleep during the 3 days preceding the accident. He was in good health and was not taking any medications. She further reported that he was happy with his life and did not have any major life stressors. The pilot was not employed outside of AMC, enjoyed his job with the company, and had not mentioned any concerns about the company or its helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's coworkers and managers provided positive feedback about his performance. He was described as professional, well prepared, thorough, and team oriented, and he exhibited good pilot skills.&#x0D;\n - The helicopter’s VEMD was found in the wreckage and was sent to the NTSB’s Vehicle Recorders Division in Washington, DC. No usable data were recovered from the VEMD because the thermal damage to the nonvolatile memory chip precluded normal recovery procedures and additional attempts to yield usable data were unsuccessful. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCockpit Indications &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe metallic debris found in the No. 2 engine rear bearing strainer and electric chip detector was sufficient to trigger the circuit for the “ENG CHIP” caution. The “ENG CHIP” caution would have appeared in the No. 2 engine column of the Caution and Advisory Display (CAD) and associated with an audible (Gong).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirbus Helicopters performed a computer simulation to determine what the FLI might theoretically indicate in the event of a gas generator rear bearing seizure in the No. 2 engine. The simulation assumed that the gas generator continued to rotate momentarily with damage to the high-pressure turbines and without friction in the seized rear bearing. Figure 3 shows a representation of the FLI before and during such a rear bearing seizure. Airbus Helicopters noted that this simulation depicted a snapshot of the simulated conditions and that, during operations, the needles would move and numeric values would fluctuate based on the engine parameters, the power applied, and the evolution of the bearing failure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3 - Simulated FLI display before and during rear bearing seizure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left image of figure 3 shows the FLI with the engine operating normally, prior to a bearing seizure. Both FLI needles should depict TRQ because that would be the first limiting parameter for both engines in the flight conditions on the day of the accident. The needles would both indicate the same or nearly the same value for TRQ because both engines should produce about the same power, as the engines are TRQ balanced by the VARTOMS system. The simulation showed that, with a rear bearing seizure in the No. 2 engine, the engine's turbine outlet temperature would be elevated such that the TOT limit would be reached before the torque limit. Thus, an elevated turbine outlet temperature would result in the FLI changing to TOT for the No. 2 engine, as denoted by the white box for the No. 2 engine moving from the TRQ label (in the left image) to the TOT label (in the right image) and the position of the needle for the No. 2 engine changing. In addition, because TOT reached its limit, the digital value appeared with a red bar underneath it. The No. 1 engine would remain limited by TRQ, as indicated by the white box for the No. 1 engine next to the TRQ label (in the right image). As a result, a large split in the needles would occur because they would no longer indicate the same parameter for each engine, even though both engines would still be initially producing the same torque (39% in the figure). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FLI page is displayed on the upper VEMD screen. The FLI zone indicates the TRQ, TOT and the N1 parameters in numerical values, along the left side of the display for engine No.1, and the right side of the display for engine No. 2. The parameter which is closest to its limit drives the analog pointer (needle) of the scale, and it is marked by a solid white rectangle next to the parameter label. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe limiting parameter adherent to the white rectangle mark is additionally underlined yellow if in the caution range. The underlining changes to a flashing red color if a limit is reached, and this is associated with a ´Gong` in order to raise attention with the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Airbus Helicopters, an FLI indication showing one engine limited by TRQ and the other limited by TOT in cruise flight, although accurate, would be unusual and unexpected. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNormally, the FLI needles display TOT during engine start only, at which time the symbols on the outside of the needle scale change to indicate the TOT limits and safe operating range. &#x0D;\nThis scenario, in which one of the FLI needles changes to indicate TOT while the other remains indicating TRQ during cruise flight, is not presented in the training materials created and used by Airbus for factory courses teaching pilots and maintenance technicians about the aircraft systems. It is also not specifically covered in the FLM. AMC’s FAA approved Pilot Training Program utilizes information from Airbus factory courses to and the FLM to develop its courseware and content. According to AMC, this situation was also not discussed in any of the company’s training materials or demonstrated during its training program because it was never covered or emphasized in any of the Airbus courseware. However, the FLM and Airbus training procedures do provide guidance for common emergencies, including FLI needle splits, engine failures, and procedures for the ENG PA DIS (engine parameter discrepancy) caution message (described below). The guidance also includes three basic airmanship rules:&#x0D;\nMaintain aircraft control&#x0D;\nAnalyze the situation&#x0D;\nTake proper action&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe simulation also showed that an ENG PA DIS amber caution message may appear for both engines on the caution and advisory display panel, as shown in the left image of figure 4, due to the difference in TOT between engine Nos. 1 and 2. The ENG PA DIS caution message is displayed whenever a significant difference between each engine’s TOT, TRQ, or N1 is detected, or when the signal from any of these parameters is lost. For TOT, the threshold to trigger the ENG PA DIS caution is a difference of greater that 80° C between engine 1 and engine 2. Even though the ENG PA DIS message appears in both engine columns on the CAD display, the CAD display does not indicate which parameter was detected or which engine was affected. As a result, the pilot would need to refer to the FLI parameters to determine which engine is affected, as shown in the right image of Figure 4. Figure 4 shows the TOT on the right engine is the limiting parameter, and during the event, it was likely to have appeared in the right (engine 2) column of the CAD (note that the “ENG CHIP” caution activation was not part of the simulation, and is not displayed in the figure). The FLM procedure for the ENG PA DIS message is “do not try and match needles, avoid using maximum power, compare the numeric values on the FLI to verify the affected parameter, and land as soon as practicable.” The ENG PA DIS procedures do not request the pilot to shut down the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4 - Caution and advisory display panel (left) and FLI (right) showing affected engine and parameter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the ENG PA DIS caution is displayed in this situation, the master caution light also illuminates and simultaneously: &#x0D;\nThe TOT rectangle turns white, &#x0D;\nThe TOT value is underlined in red&#x0D;\nThe LIMIT warning comes on&#x0D;\nAn audio ´GONG´ sounds&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Safran, a rise in TOT would be expected as the rear bearing deteriorates. The deterioration would result in excessive play in the gas generator shaft, causing components to rub, and a reduction in engine efficiency. As a result, the fuel controller would add fuel to compensate, resulting in a higher TOT. This reduction in efficiency may also result in smoke from the engine’s exhaust.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ENG CHIP and ENG PA DIS messages can be cleared from the display by the pilot via a button on the cyclic control.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, in the event that a difference in torque between the two engines is detected that exceeds 15%, the VAR NR caution message will appear in the center of the CAD, and the MAN button on the VARTOMS panel will illuminate in amber, indicating that the VARTOMS system should be switched to manual mode, and the pilot must manually match the engines torques. The VAR NR caution message will also illuminate if a problem is detected with the VARTOMS system (or other systems it is dependent upon) or if the rotor speed is not with the expected limits. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther, if a difference in N1 between the 2 engines is detected that exceeds 10%, the ENG SPLIT caution message will appear in both engine columns on the CAD. The FLM procedure for an ENG SPLIT caution message is to adjust the collective lever to OEI limits or below, turn off bleed air consumers, and analyze engine conditions.&#x0D;\n - The helicopter impacted a shallow turf drainage pathway, which was about 30 ft wide and 2,000 ft long, located between two fields of 8-ft-tall grass near a wind turbine farm. The fuselage came to rest in a 7-ft-wide ditch in the center of the pathway and was oriented on a magnetic heading of 261°. There were no ground scars leading to or from the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage revealed that all of the major helicopter components were present at the accident site. The cabin had collapsed downward and was partially consumed by a postcrash fire. The tailboom remained largely intact. Flight control continuity was established from the cockpit area to the rotor systems and engines. The four main rotor blades and the two tail rotor blades remained attached to their rotor hubs. The No. 4 main rotor blade was found rotated about 180° in its hub with the pitch links fractured and partially melted. The outboard 4 ft of the No. 3 main rotor blade came to rest in the 8-ft-tall grass adjacent to the drainage path, and the grass on both sides of the blade was undisturbed. None of the main or tail rotor blades exhibited leading edge damage, chordwise scratches, or other evidence of rotation. The tail rotor shaft remained attached to the transmission, which could not be manually rotated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe portion of the warning unit in the cockpit that contained the No. 2 engine fire warning light/button was located in the wreckage. Examination by the National Transportation Safety Board’s (NTSB) Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC, revealed that the filaments in all four of the No. 2 engine fire warning light/button’s light bulbs were stretched. The portion of the warning panel containing the No. 1 engine fire warning light/button was identified at the accident scene but was subsequently separated from the remaining section of the warning panel during recovery. The No. 1 engine fire warning light bulbs were not examined. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo foreign object damage was found on the axial compressor blades of both engines. No damage was observed on the visible portions of the turbine blades at the aft part of the engines. The gas generator of the No. 1 engine moved freely when manually rotated, whereas the No. 2 engine gas generator did not rotate. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was also equipped with engine throttle twist grips on the pilot's collective control stick. Each twist grip had a lockout button that prevented the grip from being inadvertently rotated from FLIGHT to IDLE and from IDLE to OFF; the button had to be pressed to rotate the grip. The No. 1 engine grip was located at the top of the collective control tube, and the No. 2 engine grip was located immediately below the No. 1 grip (and closer to the hinge of the collective tube). Each grip had a different grooved pattern to manually distinguish one from the other. The No. 1 engine twist-grip throttle control was found in the OFF position. The No. 2 engine twist-grip throttle control was found in the FLIGHT position. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe No. 1 engine fuel control unit was found in the 0° (cutoff) position. The No. 2 engine fuel control unit was found in the 62° position, which was slightly beyond the 52° (flight) position.&#x0D;\nThe No. 1 engine fuel shutoff valve was found in the open position. The No. 2 engine fuel shutoff valve was damaged, and its position could not initially be determined. X-ray images of the valve by the NTSB’s Materials Laboratory revealed that the valve was in the open position. &#x0D;\nEngine No.1 disassembly and component examination did not reveal any discrepancies other than damage due to the crash and the post-crash fire. The No. 1 engine rear bearing oil return strainer/chip detector was absent of debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe No. 2 engine disassembly revealed that the gas generator shaft rear bearing was mechanically damaged. A detailed examination of the bearing at the engine manufacturer’s laboratory revealed that all of the bearing roller elements were found seized (that is, none of the roller elements would rotate), with the outer bearing race, and had rubbed against the inner rotating bearing race. The roller elements appeared ground down (flattened) and overheated. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll of the oil supply pipes and restrictors and jet were found clear. The tubes to and from the rear bearing chamber (the oil supply tube, scavenge tube and vent tube) each contained a thin layer of coked oil, and were not obstructed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 compares the No. 2 engine rear bearing with the undamaged No. 1 engine rear bearing. Turbine components and the end of the No. 2 engine gas generator shaft exhibited rotational non-uniform damage. This damage was consistent with some continued rotation of the gas generator spool after the bearing had seized. (The turbine shaft supported by the rear bearing rotates at speeds up to 53,500 rpm.) &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 - Gas generator shaft rear bearings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe No. 2 engine rear bearing oil return strainer/chip detector had carbon-like and ferrous debris in the strainer. Some debris particles were found bridging the gap between chip detector electrodes. The strainer was not completely obstructed by the debris. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDownstream of the rear bearing’s casing, the oil return pipe and the suction stage of the oil pump also contained metallic debris. All the debris found in the suction stage were examined and were consistent with the constituents of components found in the oil system and in the rear bearing assembly. The oil pump, reduction gears and bearings did not show any indications of operation with lack of or insufficient lubrication. &#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with two three-way union deck fittings (one for each engine bay) that routed the engines’ two oil drain lines and the rear bearing housing vent line to the engine deck and then to an overboard port. The rear bearing vent line and one of the oil drain lines were attached to the ports of each fitting with elastomeric tubing and hose clamps. For these connections, an approved maintenance option allowed the installation of a shrink tubing jacket on the deck fitting nipples before the elastomeric tubing was attached over the shrink tube jacket. Damaged tubing remnants remained attached to the ports of the No. 1 engine three-way union deck fitting. The oil drain line ports and the rear bearing vent line port were completely blocked. Examination of the obstruction within each port by the NTSB’s Materials Laboratory found that the material was consistent with that of the shrink tube jacket. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe No. 2 engine three-way union deck fitting ports had no obstructions. No tubing remained attached to the deck fitting ports. Examination of the fitting by the NTSB’s Materials Laboratory determined that the fitting was exposed to temperature and time conditions sufficient to decompose the shrink tube jacket and elastomeric tubing materials.&#x0D;\n -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter pilot and observer were conducting an aerial observation flight. The helicopter had been providing the Virginia State Police (VSP) with a continuous video downlink of the public demonstrations that were occurring in Charlottesville, Virginia, when the flight crew was tasked to provide overwatch for a motorcade. Radar data indicated that the helicopter was flying at an altitude of about 2,200 ft mean sea level (msl) in the area of the motorcade before it began to turn to the right and descend rapidly. Radar data also indicated that, about 30 seconds later, the helicopter was descending through 1,450 ft msl at a groundspeed of 30 knots. Shortly afterward, the helicopter descended below the area of radar coverage, and radar contact was lost. A witness aboard another helicopter observed the accident helicopter descending in an upright position into trees at a high rate of descent. The helicopter impacted the ground and a postcrash fire ensued.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Video from a security camera, which was located about 1.2 miles from the accident site captured the helicopter toward the end of the flight and showed that the helicopter was descending vertically at a constant acceleration and with increasing negative vertical speed until ground impact. Photographs of the accident helicopter that were taken by a ground witness revealed that, about the time that the helicopter began its vertical descent, the helicopter was yawing to the right at a rate between 87° and 97° per second. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe damage to the main wreckage was consistent with impact forces and the postcrash fire. Hard-body foreign object damage observed on the first-stage compressor blades was consistent with the ingestion of metallic helicopter debris after the helicopter impacted trees and the ground. Thus, the engine was operating at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft section of the tailboom was found about 100 to 150 feet from the main wreckage site, and pieces of the tail rotor control tube from the midsection of the tailboom were near the main wreckage and the aft section of the tailboom. Signatures of main rotor contact were observed at multiple locations along the aft section of the tailboom. Given the proximity of the aft section of the tailboom to the main wreckage site, the main rotor would likely have contacted the tailboom shortly before ground impact and not during the onset of the right yaw.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the pedal restrictor control system (PRCS) cam was found in the engaged position, examination of the PRCS found no anomalies consistent with a system malfunction. Therefore, the PRCS cam could have activated during the vertical descent and have limited left pedal forward travel, particularly if the helicopter's nose was lowered during the descent and the resulting airspeed was more than 55 knots (the airspeed at which left pedal travel would be restricted). Regardless, even if the PRCS were engaged, sufficient pedal travel would have been present to maintain heading in a hover out of ground effect.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's autopsy found moderate coronary artery disease without evidence of a previous scar or heart damage. Although the pilot could have been incapacitated by a number of medical conditions, such as a seizure, sudden loss of consciousness, or arrhythmia, that would have left no evidence at autopsy, he did not have a higher risk for such events even with his moderate coronary artery disease. Thus, the pilot's medical condition was not a factor in this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToward the end of the flight, the helicopter's low forward airspeed while descending was consistent with the helicopter entering vortex ring state. As a result, even though power was applied, the helicopter was unable to reduce the descent rate, and it continued descending with an estimated vertical acceleration between 10.5 and 13.5 ft/s2. Anecdotal information indicated that the pilot had knowledge of vortex ring state, but review of the pilot's training records indicated that he had not received any formal recurrent vortex ring state recognition and recovery training during his 16 years with the VSP aviation unit. Also, the VSP aviation unit training manual did not include vortex ring state recognition and recovery in any of the sample lesson plans for initial or recurrent training, and the associated maneuvers were considered to be optional.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped with, and was not required to be equipped with, crash-resistant flight recorders. The recovered engine control unit data revealed a sharp increase in torque, from 54% to 104% immediately before the helicopter's descent. Insufficient left pedal input with increasing torque can result in a right yaw that can develop into a spin. The lack of flight recorder data for this accident precluded an evaluation of the pilot's actions before the overtorque and the right yaw. Additionally, the lack of flight recorder data precluded a determination of the pilot's actions during the helicopter's entry into vortex ring state, including any attempt to recover. Last, the available data were insufficient to determine if the right yaw began immediately before or after the helicopter's encounter with the vortex ring state. This accident demonstrates the benefit of crash-resistant flight recorders aboard turbine-powered, nonexperimental, nonrestricted-category aircraft that are not currently required to be so equipped.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Vortex Ring State&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA's Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21B), a vortex ring state \"describes an aerodynamic condition in which a helicopter may be in a vertical descent with 20 percent up to maximum power applied, and little or no climb performance.\" The handbook also states the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA fully developed vortex ring state is characterized by an unstable condition in which a helicopter experiences uncommanded pitch and roll oscillations, has little or no collective authority, and achieves a descent rate that may approach 6,000 feet per minute (fpm) if allowed to develop….&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSituations that are conducive to a vortex ring state condition are attempting to hover OGE without maintaining precise altitude control, and approaches, especially steep approaches, with a tailwind component.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen recovering from a vortex ring state condition, the pilot tends first to try to stop the descent by increasing collective pitch. The traditional recovery is accomplished by increasing airspeed, and/or partially lowering collective to exit the vortex. In most helicopters, lateral cyclic thrust combined with an increase in power and lateral antitorque thrust will produce the quickest exit from the hazard.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVortex Ring State Training&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA's Helicopter Instructor's Handbook (FAA-H-8083-4), vortex ring state (also known as settling with power) can safely be introduced and practiced at altitudes allowing distance to recover. The handbook also states the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEnsure the student understands that settling with power can occur as a result of attempting to descend at an excessively low airspeed in a downwind condition, or by attempting to hover OGE at a weight and density altitude greater than the helicopter's performance allows….&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecovery is accomplished by…if altitude allows, reducing collective and lowering the nose to increase forward speed. This moves a helicopter out of its downwash and into translational lift. When the helicopter is clear of the disturbed air, or downwash, confirm a forward speed indication and initiate a climb to regain the lost altitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVirginia State Police Aviation Unit Training Manual&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe VSP aviation unit training manual required that its unit instructors refer to the current Federal Aviation Regulations and the FAA's practical test standards for standardization. Review of the practical test standards for rotorcraft revealed a required task for settling with power (vortex ring state) for which pilots were to (1) exhibit knowledge of the elements related to settling with power, (2) promptly recognize the onset of settling with power, and (3) use the appropriate recovery procedure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the VSP aviation unit training manual revealed that vortex ring state was not listed in any of the sample lesson plans for initial or recurrent training and that the associated maneuvers were considered to be optional. Anecdotal information indicated that the pilot had knowledge of vortex ring state, but review of the accident pilot's training records from 2001 to the accident found no record of him receiving settling with power or vortex ring state recognition and recovery training on the accident helicopter make and model. - During this mission, the accident helicopter was configured with single main controls at the pilot's station and locked out pedals at the copilot (observer) station.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter's turbine engine had a full authority digital engine control (FADEC) system. The engine control unit (ECU) would continuously monitor the FADEC system for faults and would alert the pilot of any faults that could significantly impact engine performance.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter was also equipped with an airspeed-actuated pedal restrictor control system (PRCS), which reduces total left pedal travel at higher airspeeds by automatically adjusting the left pedal's forward stop. When the helicopter accelerates above 55 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), the PRCS solenoid energizes, engaging a cam that limits forward travel of the left pedal by 25%, which reduces tail rotor blade angle from 25° to 17° When the helicopter decelerates below 50 KIAS, the PRCS solenoid de-energizes, which disengages the cam and enables full forward travel of the left pedal. - On August 12, 2017, about 1649 eastern daylight time, a Bell 407 helicopter, N31VA, was destroyed when it was involved in an accident in Charlottesville, Virginia. The pilot and the observer were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated as a public aerial observation flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Virginia State Police (VSP), the purpose of the flight was to provide the VSP command center with a continuous video downlink of the public demonstrations that were occurring in Charlottesville. The helicopter departed Charlottesville Albemarle Airport (CHO) about 1600. The helicopter arrived over the area of the demonstrations at 1604 and remained there until 1642 when the flight crew was tasked to provide overwatch for the Governor of Virginia's motorcade. At 1643, the flight crew advised the VSP command center that the helicopter was heading directly to the motorcade and was about 30 seconds away.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRadar data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) indicated that, at 1648, the helicopter was flying at an altitude of about 2,200 ft mean sea level (msl) in the area of the motorcade. At that time, the helicopter was traveling north-northwest before it began to turn to the right and descend rapidly. Radar data indicated that, at 1648:30, the helicopter was descending at a rate of 6,800ft/min through 1,450 ft msl at a groundspeed of 30 knots. The helicopter then descended below the area of radar coverage, and radar contact was lost.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1649, a crewmember aboard a Fairfax County Police Department (FCPD) helicopter observed the accident helicopter descending upright into trees at a high rate of descent and then observed a \"stirring\" of debris. The crewmember advised the pilot, who immediately contacted the VSP command center to report that a helicopter had crashed. The pilot of the FCPD helicopter attempted to contact the accident helicopter but was unable to make contact with the flight crew. The FCPD helicopter pilot then landed near the accident site to render aid. The other two crewmembers exited the helicopter and proceeded to the accident site. Upon reaching the accident site, the crewmembers encountered heavy black smoke and fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe VSP interviewed 47 witnesses to the accident. Although their descriptions of the helicopter's altitude, direction of flight, and velocity varied, most witnesses reported that the helicopter, after initially hovering, entered a rolling oscillation, began to spin about its vertical axis, and descended in a 45° nose-down attitude while continuing to spin. Witnesses reported that they lost sight of the helicopter below the tops of the surrounding trees and then observed a plume of smoke rising from the area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVideo from a security camera located about  1.2 miles from the accident site captured images of the helicopter in a vertical descent with increasing vertical speed as the helicopter continued to descend toward the ground. Still photographs taken by a witness showed that the helicopter was spinning in a clockwise direction (when viewed from above the helicopter). - The Virginia Department of Health, Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Richmond, Virginia, performed autopsies of the pilot and the observer. The pilot's cause of death was blunt force injury to the head, torso and extremities, and the observer's cause of death was blunt force injuries to the head and torso. The autopsy also identified the pilot's moderate coronary artery disease with a 60% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The remainder of the heart examination was unremarkable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing at the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory were negative for the pilot for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and all drugs tested. The testing for the observer detected naproxen in his urine samples. Naproxen is a non-narcotic analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent that is available over the counter and as a prescription. Carbon monoxide and ethanol were not detected in the observer's specimens. - A sounding (a high-resolution rapid refresh model) for the accident site and time depicted a light and variable wind of 3 knots with clear skies over the accident site. No significant turbulence or wind shear was detected. - The pilot had been employed with the VSP aviation unit since 1999 and became the unit commander in December 2012. The observer had been employed with the VSP aviation unit since July 2017. - Performance Study&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe performance study for the accident flight was conducted using three data sources: 1) data recovered from the ECU; 2) radar data from airport surveillance radar (ASR)-9, which was located about 3 nautical miles north of CHO; and 3) automatic dependent surveillance – broadcast (ADS-B) system data.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nASR-9 radar data showed that the helicopter left the downtown Charlottesville area about 1644:00 and flew to the southwest and then to the north. The terrain below the helicopter had an elevation from 300 to 600 ft. The helicopter's maximum groundspeed was above 100 knots early in the flight and then varied from 5 to 80 knots during the rest of the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADS-B data toward the end of the flight indicated that the helicopter was climbing and that its calculated forward airspeed was slowing until 1646:00, when the helicopter leveled off at 1,950 ft for about 1 minute. The helicopter then began climbing again, reaching an altitude of 2,250 ft, and its forward airspeed slowed from 30 to about 20 knots. At 1648:06, the helicopter's forward airspeed increased to 30 knots. Four seconds later, the helicopter climbed from 2,225 to 2,275 ft, and its forward airspeed slowed to about 10 knots. The helicopter's descent began at 1648:18.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe nonvolatile memory from the ECU was successfully downloaded. About 20 seconds of parametric data, which included rotor speed, torque, collective position, gas generator speed, and absolute ambient pressure, were recorded at the end of flight. The ECU data revealed an increase in torque, from 54% to 104%, immediately before the helicopter's descent. The ECU data also indicated that, between 1648:18 and 1648:20, the collective position decreased from 40% to 14% and that, during the next second, the collective position increased to about 30%. Even as the collective continued to increase to a peak of 68% by 1648:31, the helicopter's altitude  decreased, indicating that the helicopter did not respond to the increase in collective.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA video study determined the motion of the helicopter based on the security camera video, which captured about 10 seconds of the helicopter's descent but not the beginning of the descent, and a sequence of four still photographs, which were taken during a 2-second period. The video study indicated that, according to the security camera video, the helicopter was descending with an estimated vertical acceleration of 12 ± 1.5 ft/s2. The photographs indicated that the estimated yaw rate of the helicopter about 20 seconds before impact was at least 92° ± 5° per second in the clockwise direction. The helicopter had already started descending at the time that this estimated yaw rate occurred. The helicopter tail structure appeared undamaged in the photographs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter 1648:16, the helicopter's low forward speed while descending put it in or near a region conducive to a vortex ring state, which is an aerodynamic condition that occurs when the helicopter descends at the downward speed of its own vortex wake.  The vortex system accumulates, building in strength and producing increased downwash through the main rotor.  The rotor, operating in a high downwash field, is unable to arrest the helicopter's descent rate, even with increased collective. Even though the collective was raised after 1648:20, the helicopter's altitude did not increase. The security camera video and the photographs of the descent, which were determined to be after 1648:22, showed that the helicopter rolled to the left, between 30-57 degrees, as it was spinning to the right.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPedal Restrictor Control System Calculations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTo determine the effect on tail rotor authority if the PRCS were to remain engaged below 50 KIAS, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) requested that Bell perform calculations to determine the left pedal control margin that would be available for different airspeed conditions with the PRCS cam engaged. The calculations used conditions similar to those on the day of the accident: a gross helicopter weight of 4,633 pounds, an ambient temperature of 86°F (30°C), and a pressure altitude of 2,200 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBell determined that the left pedal margin would increase with increasing airspeeds and that a hover out of ground effect (OGE) would be the most critical condition for restricted left pedal authority. The calculated tail rotor blade collective pitch angle that would be needed to maintain heading while hovering OGE was between 10° and 11°. If the PRCS were to remain engaged during a hover, a tail rotor blade collective pitch angle of 17° could be achieved with full left pedal travel restricted by the PRCS. Without the PRCS engaged, a tail rotor blade collective pitch angle of about 25° +/- 0.5 could be achieved with the left pedal at its unrestricted full forward position. - Accident Site&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage came to rest in an upright position along a magnetic heading of 333° in heavily wooded terrain that was adjacent to a residence. The main wreckage comprised the main fuselage (cockpit and cabin), aft fuselage, forward section of the tailboom, midsection of the tailboom (including the horizontal stabilizer), main rotor system, and engine. The main wreckage showed damage consistent with impact with trees and the ground. The main fuselage, aft fuselage, main rotor system, and engine were thermally damaged from the postcrash fire. The landing gear exhibited multiple fractures and a flattened appearance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft section of the tailboom, containing the tail rotor gearbox, tail rotor, and vertical stabilizer, was found about 40 ft above the ground in a tree and about 100 to 150 ft south-southwest of the main wreckage. Debris from the fragmented tailboom was found in a debris field that spanned about 300 ft in length west of the main wreckage. Examination of the fragmented tailboom sections revealed multiple angled cuts consistent with main rotor blade contact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain Rotor System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub remained attached to the main rotor mast, and the four main rotor blades remained attached to their respective hub locations. For one of the main rotor blades, the pitch horn lug (for the pitch control link upper rod end) was fractured from its pitch horn. The pitch horn lug fracture surface exhibited signatures consistent with overload and thermal damage. Neither the fractured pitch horn lug nor the pitch control link upper rod end were found. The remainder of the major components of the main rotor system were found within or near the main wreckage site and exhibited fragmentation from impact and thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor gearbox remained attached to the airframe. Drive continuity was established within the main rotor gearbox. The engine-to-transmission driveshaft was present, but its aft coupling was fractured.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTail Rotor and Tail Rotor Drive System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSections of the tail rotor drive system, from the steel tail rotor drive shaft at the forward end to the tail rotor gearbox input at the aft end, were recovered from the main wreckage, the debris field, and the aft tailboom section. Reconstruction of the tail rotor drive system revealed that most of the components were present except for the No. 3 tail rotor drive shaft, the forward portion of the No. 4 tail rotor drive shaft, and the hanger bearing between the Nos. 3 and 4 tail rotor drive shafts, which were not found. Fractures observed on the Nos. 1, 2, and 4 tail rotor drive shaft tubes were consistent with main rotor blade contact and were co-located with the angled cuts observed on the tailboom.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor gearbox remained installed on the tailboom, and drive continuity within the gearbox was established. Residual oil was present within the gearbox, and the magnetic chip detector revealed no evidence of debris. The tail rotor remained installed on the tail rotor gearbox output shaft. Both tail rotor blades remained installed and were intact. One tail rotor blade displayed damage to its tip end, consistent with contacting the left side of the tailboom. The tail rotor blade leading edge also displayed a damaged area about 3 inches wide and about 15.5 inches inboard from the tip. The other tail rotor blade exhibited no anomalous damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was found in the main wreckage lying on its right side near its installed location. All engine mounts had fractured in overload. The engine exhibited impact damage and was bent at an angle of about 30° at the junction of the turbine and gearbox modules. All major components for the engine were found at the main wreckage site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe oil and pneumatic lines were manually checked and none showed evidence of looseness. The leading edges of the compressor impeller blades exhibited evidence of hard-body foreign object debris ingestion.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ECU was found in the main wreckage near its installed location with one of its electrical connectors still attached. The ECU exhibited thermal damage due to the postcrash fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight Controls Systems&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe three main rotor actuators were found in the main wreckage near their installed locations and exhibited impact and thermal damage. The main rotor controls, from the cyclic and collective to the swashplate, and the tail rotor controls, from the pedals to the forward section of the tailboom, sustained multiple fractures due to impact forces, and portions were consumed by the postcrash fire. Pieces of the tail rotor control tube from the midsection of the tailboom were recovered in the debris field. The tail rotor control system remained intact within the aft section of the tailboom (which was found in a tree, as previously discussed) except for slight bending of the tail rotor pitch control rods near the rod ends. The recovered main rotor and tail rotor controls showed no evidence of disconnection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PRCS remained installed, but its solenoid exhibited impact damage. The PRCS cam was found in the engaged position. The PRCS emergency release cable (which enables manual disengagement of the PRCS pedal stop) was found in the cockpit and was thermally damaged, and the copper wire for the emergency release cable (which prevents the inadvertent disengagement of the PRCS pedal stop and provides an indication for when the emergency release has been pulled) was found unbroken. The plastic pull knob for the emergency release cable was not recovered, and the adjacent cable housing exhibited thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA pitot-static test bench was used to functionally test the pedal restrictor control unit (a PRCS component). The unit responded normally in activating and extinguishing the PRCS engagement and solenoid activation lights when pitot-static pressure (to simulate airspeed) was increased and decreased, respectively. The solenoid functioned normally when power was applied to it. Functionality of the emergency release cable was confirmed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAvian Material Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the investigation, no evidence was observed to suggest that the accident was the result of a mid-air collision involving another aircraft, or object, and examination of samples taken from the main rotor, nose, windscreen, and cockpit areas were examined for microscopic avian material. No bird remains were found in any of the samples. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The private pilot, who did not hold a rotorcraft rating, departed in the helicopter on a routine flight to check and observe crop fields, business facilities, and other business-related assets. A search was initiated when the pilot did not return from the flight, and the accident site was located in a field the following morning. There were no witnesses to the accident. Data obtained from an onboard GPS showed the helicopter making a series of turns at a low altitude above the field in which the wreckage was located. Examination of the helicopter did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions and there was no damage to nearby obstructions to suggest an in-flight collision. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's autopsy revealed scarring in heart muscle from previous heart attacks and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Each of these findings significantly increased his risk for a sudden arrhythmia. Such an arrhythmia would likely cause sudden symptoms such as palpitations or altered/decreased consciousness as a result of diminished blood pressure. It is likely that scarring from previous heart attacks and severe hypertrophy of the left ventricular wall caused arrhythmia which resulted in incapacitation and a loss of control at low altitude. Although the pilot did not hold a rating for rotorcraft, his recent flight experience in the accident helicopter performing similar flight profiles make it unlikely that he simply lost helicopter control.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The accident helicopter, serial number 13910, was a Robinson R44 II, four-place, two-bladed, single main rotor, single-engine helicopter, with skid-type landing gear. The primary structure was welded steel tubing and riveted aluminum. The tailboom was a semi-monocoque structure consisting of an aluminum skin. Each seat was equipped with a combined seat belt and inertia reel shoulder strap. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a Lycoming IO-540- AE1A5 engine, serial number L-36203-48E, rated at 260 horsepower; however, according to the helicopter's type certificate, the engine had a 5-minute takeoff rating of 245 horsepower and a maximum continuous rating of 205 horsepower.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was registered to the owner on December 1, 2015. - On June 3, 2017, about 1437 central daylight time, a Robinson R44 II  helicopter, N7091F, impacted terrain while maneuvering at near Dimmitt, Texas. The private pilot sustained fatal injuries, and the helicopter sustained substantial damage. The helicopter was registered to Don Oppliger Trucking, Inc, Clovis, New Mexico, and privately operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed for the local business flight, which departed a private helipad near Farwell, Texas, about 1302.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's business manager, the pilot departed on a routine flight to check and observe crop fields, business facilities, and other business-related assets. When the pilot did not return from the flight, a search was initiated. The helicopter wreckage was located in a field about 0800 the following morning. There were no witnesses to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight data downloaded from a Garmin GPSmap 496 handheld GPS unit located at the accident site included the accident flight. Data extracted from the unit included 13 flight track logs from April 22, 2017, to June 3, 2017. The accident flight was recorded starting at 1302:31 and ended at 1437:28, and included 730 discrete points. The flight track was consistent with the pilot overflying fields, facilities, and other business assets. The end of the data showed the helicopter making a series of turns at a low altitude above the field where the wreckage was located. - An autopsy was performed by South Plains Forensic Pathology, P.A., Lubbock, Texas. The cause of death was blood loss due to visceral injuries due to blunt force injuries, and the manner of death was an accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe autopsy also described significant heart disease. The heart weighed 610 gm and both the ventricles were dilated; the left ventricle was described as having severe hypertrophy, but no measurements were given. There was very severe coronary artery disease in the native arteries, but the grafts were all described as patent. A stent was identified, but not further described. Sections of the myocardium revealed scarring from old heart attacks in the left ventricle. Microscopy of the heart showed myocyte hypertrophy with interstitial and perivascular fibrosis. There were areas where adipose and fibrotic tissue replaced normal cells.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the Federal Aviation Administration's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, identified no ethanol in the vitreous. In addition, salicylate (a metabolite of aspirin) was found in urine, losartan was found in cavity blood and liver, and clopidogrel was identified in liver tissue. As stated above, none of these are considered impairing. - The pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) private pilot certificate with airplane single and multi-engine land and instrument airplane ratings. The pilot did not hold a rotorcraft rating; however, according to his business manager, he had flown helicopters for several years for business purposes. Based on the 177 total hours on the accident helicopter, the pilot's estimated rotorcraft flight experience was at least 177 hours. The pilot reported a total flight experience of 4,225 hours on his 2016 FAA medical certificate application.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA medical files, the 68 year-old pilot reported having had a 4 vessel coronary artery bypass graft procedure in 2008, followed by a stent in his right coronary artery in 2009. After reviewing the data related to these events, the FAA granted the pilot special issuance medical certificates beginning in 2010. At the time of his last aviation medical examination on March 29, 2017, he reported using aspirin and clopidogrel as blood thinners, losartan for blood pressure control, and a combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin to control his cholesterol. None of these were considered impairing. A stress echo cardiogram, dated January 6, 2017, demonstrated that the pilot reached 16 mets, more than 150% of the target heart rate, and had no ischemic findings on his electrocardiogram or echocardiogram. The aviation medical examiner found no abnormalities and the pilot received a special issuance third class medical certificate limited by a requirement for corrective lenses and marked, \"Not valid for any class after March 31, 2018.\" - Examination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter came to rest on its right side in a wheat field (the wheat crop was about 3 inches tall) owned by the pilot's business. Three ground scars, consistent with main rotor blade strikes, were observed adjacent to the main wreckage. Fragmented plexiglass was scattered between the ground scars and main wreckage. Separated sections of the main rotor blades were located within a 75-ft diameter of the main wreckage; the main rotor blades were fragmented, bent, deformed, and their root sections remained attached to the rotor hub. No evidence of contact with any adjacent structures or power lines was observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lower forward fuselage was crushed aft and upward. The tailboom was intact, and the horizontal stabilizer was bent. No damage was noted to the tail skid. The forward landing gear skid tubes were fractured, and the left forward skid tube was separated and located in the debris field. The left forward door was separated, the right forward door and rear cabin doors were damaged and partially fragmented. The forward seat belts and shoulder harnesses were unlatched. The helicopter was not equipped with an emergency locator transmitter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was established from the cockpit flight controls to the swashplate and tail rotor system. Drivetrain continuity was established from the engine to the main transmission and tail rotor systems.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the engine mount and secured in the airframe. Thumb compression was noted on all cylinders, and mechanical continuity throughout the engine was established. The magnetos and ignition leads produced spark when engine crankshaft was rotated. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The purpose of the flight was for the airline transport pilot of the helicopter to practice solo instrument approaches in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). The pilot received adequate preflight weather briefings using company-approved weather sources, including one 35 minutes before departure. The terminal area forecast published earlier that morning and valid for the pilot's anticipated time of arrival at the destination indicated that the visibility would be 6 statute miles with an overcast ceiling at 1,200 ft agl; though the most recent surface observation report contradicted the forecast, indicating that the visibility was 4 statute miles in rain and the overcast ceiling was at 500 ft. The pilot subsequently submitted a flight request form to his company, which documented the weather products he reviewed before the flight and indicated that he was aware of the reported and the forecast weather conditions for the route before departure. The company's operation control center approved and released the helicopter for the flight. A review of weather radar and surface weather observation reports current at the time of the departure revealed that the helicopter entered and remained in IMC as it continued to the destination airport.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of radar data and air traffic control (ATC) communications revealed that controllers provided radar vectors to the pilot for an instrument landing system (ILS) approach. The helicopter intercepted the localizer course about 1 nautical mile (nm) outside the approach gate. The controller then cleared the pilot for the approach with a restriction to maintain an altitude at or above 2,000 ft mean sea level (msl), which was both the assigned altitude and the intermediate altitude for the approach, until established on the approach and to contact the control tower at the destination airport. The pilot acknowledged the clearance and contacted the tower controller shortly thereafter. After checking in with the tower controller; the helicopter maintained 2,000 ft msl as it continued through the glideslope and crossed over the locator outer marker, which had a published crossing altitude of 1,842 ft msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the helicopter reached a point about 3 nm inside the outer marker, while flying at an altitude about 2,000 ft msl, the pilot declared a missed approach, telling the controller that he had received \"some bad vectors at the very end\" and that he wanted to \"just line up and come back around again.\" The controller advised the pilot to fly the published missed approach procedure (a straight-ahead climb to 900 ft msl and then a left climbing turn toward the next navigational fix, at an altitude 2,000 ft msl). The helicopter then climbed straight ahead to an altitude of 2,525 ft msl in 9 seconds, before it turned right and started descending rapidly. The helicopter's calculated rate of climb before it began to descend was about 3,000 ft/min, while it's calculated groundspeed was about 120 knots. This climb rate and speed were not consistent with the pilot using the helicopter's automatic flight control system go-around mode because they were well above the climb rate and groundspeed that the \"go around\" mode would have maintained. Radar contact was lost as the helicopter descended through 1,625 ft msl, and the calculated descent rate between the helicopter's final two radar-recorded positions was more than 7,000 ft/min.  No further communications were received from the pilot. One witness reported seeing the helicopter \"spinning down…out of the clouds in an upside-down nose dive.\" Another witness reported that the helicopter descended \"like a rocket\" and that he did not observe any smoke or fire before the helicopter impacted the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest in a ditch, fragmented and mostly consumed by postimpact fire, about 3,200 ft before the runway threshold. All the helicopter's major components were located in the wreckage area. Examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe weather conditions recorded at the destination airport showed that IMC existed with easterly surface winds, visibility 2 1/2 statute miles in mist, an overcast ceiling at 500 ft agl, and temperature and dew point of 16°C. An AIRMET was current for low-level wind shear and turbulence for the region at the time of the accident, and high resolution rapid refresh model sounding data from around the time of the accident indicated that there was a possibility of turbulence. However, there was no verification of any significant wind shear or turbulence in any PIREPs, and the pilot did not report turbulence to air traffic control. Therefore, it could not be determined if turbulence contributed to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the radar vectors provided by the controller during the approach were contrary to the FAA's guidance to air traffic controllers, which required aircraft to be vectored to intercept an ILS localizer course 2 nm outside the approach gate given the weather conditions that prevailed at that time, radar data confirmed that the helicopter successfully tracked inbound toward the airport on the localizer course. Although the radar vectors did not directly contribute to the accident, they likely increased the pilot's task load during the accident sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral factors indicated that the pilot was task-saturated when the accident sequence occurred: he was performing an instrument approach that he had not previously performed; he was provided radar vectors close to the approach gate, which accelerated the timeline of the approach procedure; and he was likely already planning the return flight to the departure airport, which he previously indicated to the controller that he would conduct following the approach. That the pilot did not descend the helicopter after intercepting the glideslope or passing the final approach fix and did not fly the published missed approach procedure are indicative that he had likely become task-saturated during the final moments of the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNontime-correlated but sequentially recorded data recovered from the helicopter's warning unit  revealed that, at some time during the accident flight, the greater-than-106% rotor rpm warning indicator illuminated multiple times, then the greater-than-112% rotor rpm warning illuminated. The rotor rpm warnings cycled between greater than 106% and 112% and less than 95% multiple times. Given that no discrepancies wiht the helicopter's engines or rotor system were discovered during the postaccident examination, it is likely that these rapid, dramatic changes in rotor rpm annunciated and recorded by the warning unit were the result of the pilot's control inputs as he became task-saturated and began to experience the effects of spatial disorientation. The helicopter's subsequent rapid climb, right turn contrary to the published missed approach instructions, and its near-vertical descent are consistent with the pilot's loss of helicopter control due to spatial disorientation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 25, 2017, at 1153 eastern daylight time, a Eurocopter Deutschland GMBH EC 135 P2 helicopter, N62UP, was destroyed when it impacted terrain near New Castle, Delaware. The airline transport pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to the University of Pennsylvania and was being operated by Metro Aviation, Inc., as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the accident site about the time of the accident, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan had been filed for the flight. The local flight originated from Atlantic City International Airport (ACY), Atlantic City, New Jersey, at 1117.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a representative of Metro Aviation, a helicopter air ambulance operator, the purpose of the flight was for the pilot to practice instrument approaches at New Castle Airport (ILG), Wilmington, Delaware, pick up a clearance in flight, and then return to ACY. The pilot obtained weather briefings via the Foreflight application at 1026 and 1042. The briefings included weather observations, forecasts, and NOTAMs for the departure, destination, and selected en route stations; PIREPs (pilot reports); and in-flight weather advisories for the planned flight. At 1043, the pilot submitted a flight request form to the company, which documented the weather products he reviewed before the flight and indicated that he was aware of the reported and forecast weather conditions for the route before departure. After reviewing the request, weather, and risk assessment, the company's operation control center approved and released the helicopter for the flight five minutes after the request was submitted. In addition, the pilot performed and signed off the preflight inspection of the helicopter the morning of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of radar data and air traffic control (ATC) communications provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) revealed that after departing from ACY, the flight proceeded uneventfully and at 1150, an ILG tower controller cleared the pilot for the ILS RWY 1 approach (see figure 1, which shows an overhead view of the helicopter's radar ground track overlaid on the ILS RWY 1 instrument approach procedure plan view). The radar track showed that the helicopter was established on the final approach course about 2,000 ft mean sea level (msl), which was both the assigned altitude and the intermediate altitude for the approach. The helicopter maintained 2,000 ft msl as it continued through the glideslope and crossed over the locator outer marker (HADIN). The published crossing altitude for HADIN while established on the glideslope was 1,842 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Figure 1. Overhead view of helicopter's radar ground track (red) overlaid onto the ILS Rwy 1 instrument approach procedure plan view. The helicopter continued on course toward the runway; when it was about 3 miles, and about 2 minutes and 15 seconds beyond HADIN and still at an altitude of 2,000 ft msl, the pilot declared a missed approach. The controller advised the pilot to fly the published missed approach procedure. (The published procedure was a straight ahead climb to 900 ft, then left climbing turn to 2,000 ft to a heading of 220° to the ELUDE fix). Following the instruction, the helicopter climbed on course to 2,525 ft msl before it turned right and started a descent to 2,225 ft msl 4 seconds later. Subsequently, radar contact was lost when the helicopter was at 1,625 ft msl, and no additional communications were received from the pilot. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne witness reported seeing the helicopter for about two seconds \"spinning down…out of the clouds in an upside-down nose dive.\" Another witness reported that the helicopter descended \"like a rocket\" and that he did not observe any smoke or fire before the helicopter impacted the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. Additionally, he held a flight instructor certificate with helicopter and instrument helicopter ratings and a private pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land and instrument airplane ratings. The pilot's most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on October 20, 2016. At that time, he reported 4,200 hours of total flight experience, 100 hours of which were in the previous 6 months.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Metro Aviation's duty log for the pilot, he had accumulated 827.0 hours of flight experience with the company since he was hired in June 2013, 21.9 hours of which were in IMC and 33.2 hours of which were simulated instrument time. Since January 1, 2016, he had completed 18 precision instrument approaches and 21 non-precision instrument approaches. The duty log indicated that, from January 2016 through the accident date, the pilot had only flown to ILG for the company once, on March 12, 2017, on a day, visual flight rules flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's most recent instrument proficiency program check flight was on April 9, 2017. During that flight, the pilot practiced several types of instrument approaches, including an ILS approach and a missed approach.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe light helicopter was manufactured in 2006 and was configured with the pilot's seat on the right side. It was equipped with two Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW206B2 engines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a four-blade, rigid hingeless, bearingless main rotor system. In addition, it had a fenestron-type antitorque system, which is comprised of a ten-blade fan housed in the vertical fin. The helicopter was also equipped with an Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS), three-axis autopilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter flight manual, the AFCS had the ability to perform several different types of instrument approaches such as localizer approaches and ILS approaches (which used localizer mode with the glide slope mode), in addition it had a \"Go around (GA) mode,\" which could be used in the event of a missed approach. When using the autopilot during an ILS approach, the AFCS would capture and fly the localizer first, and then capture the glideslope and command the helicopter to track the glideslope beam. The glideslope mode captured when the glideslope deviation was inside the -0.2/+0.5 dot range. In order to use the autopilot for an ILS approach the approach and the glide slope modes needed to be engaged separately. In the GA mode, the helicopter would acquire and hold a vertical speed of 1000 ft/min or 75 knots indicated airspeed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter's maintenance logbook, the most recent approved aircraft inspection program 100-hour inspection was conducted on April 25, 2017, at an airframe total time of 5,152.1 hours. Before the accident flight, the helicopter's airframe total time was 5,163.1 hours and the left and right engines total operating times were 5,168.9, and 5,155.7 hours, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 1036 weather observation from ILG, which was the prevailing conditions when the pilot was performing his preflight weather planning, reported wind from 070° at 13 knots, visibility 4 miles in light rain and mist, overcast clouds at 500 ft above ground level, temperature 14° C, dew point 14° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.52 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 1151 weather observation from ILG reported wind from 050° at 7 knots, visibility 2 1/2 miles in mist, overcast clouds at 500 ft above ground level, temperature 16° C, dew point 16°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.53 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHelicopter Emergency Medical Services (HEMS) Weather Tool images depicting the route between ACY and ILG, at 1000, 1030, 1100, 1130, and 1200, all indicated that IMC to \"low\" IMC prevailed in the area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTerminal Forecast&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 0800 forecast for ILG predicted wind from 080° at 12 knots, gusting to 20 knots, visibility 4 miles in light rain showers and mist, ceiling overcast at 800 ft. The forecasted weather at 1000 was with wind from 090° at 10 knots, visibility greater than 6 miles, and ceiling overcast at 1,200 ft. Then, visual flight rules (VFR) conditions at 1400, with visibility greater than 6 miles and a cloud ceiling broken at 3,500 ft. Low-level wind shear was not mentioned in the forecast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forecast for ACY predicted wind from 070° at 12 knots, visibility 5 miles in light rain showers and mist, and ceiling overcast at 600 ft. At 1000, forecast conditions included wind from 090° at 10 knots, visibility greater than 6 miles in light rain, and ceiling overcast at 1,200 ft. After 1500, VFR conditions were expected with visibility unrestricted and ceiling broken at 4,500 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nArea Forecast&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forecast for southern New Jersey issued at 0445 and valid through 1700 predicted general overcast clouds at 1,000 ft with tops to 25,000 ft and visibility 3 to 5 miles in light rain and mist through 1500, then lifting to broken at 3,500 ft with widely scattered light rain showers and thunderstorms with tops to 35,000 ft. The forecast for Delaware and northern Maryland also expected general overcast clouds at 1,000 ft with tops to 25,000 ft, with visibility 3 to 5 miles in light rain and mist. After 1400, scattered clouds at 1,500 ft, and broken clouds at 4,000 ft were expected with scattered light rain showers. The forecast was amended by AIRMET Sierra, which was current at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInflight Weather Advisories&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe primary advisories current at the time of the accident included a series of AIRMETs, which were issued at 1045, and warned of a wide area of IFR conditions, moderate turbulence, and low-level wind shear (LLWS). The conditions were expected to continue through 1700.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHigh Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) Numerical Model Sounding&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration HRRR model sounding for the approximate location of the accident at 1200 predicted a wind profile indicated easterly winds below the frontal inversion with winds veering to the south and southwest abruptly above the inversion with increasing wind speeds. The data indicated that, during the descent from 3,000 ft to 1,000 ft, a 90° shift in wind direction and speed would have occurred and that this had the potential of producing moderate or greater turbulence. The data also indicated that there was a greater than 90% probability of turbulence and/or wind shear at 1,600 ft, when the last ATC radar contact with the helicopter occurred.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAircraft Meteorological Data and Relay Observations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree aircraft provided Aircraft Meteorological Data and Relay or in situ reports, which contained real-time observations of the atmospheric conditions and observed winds immediately surrounding the time of the accident, The reports came from special instrumented aircraft departing from or arriving at the Philadelphia International Airport, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, located about 20 miles northeast of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThese reports confirmed the presence of frontal inversions and change in wind direction and speed with height. One of the airplanes, which was equipped with a moisture sensor, provided a descent sounding at 1046, which reported a saturated environment from 4,000 ft to the surface with a relative humidity greater than 97%. All three aircraft reported that the low-level wind maximums near 3,000 ft were from the south from 31 to 39 knots and that winds below 1,000 were from the east. One report showed a sharp increase in the temperature profile about 1,620 ft where the temperature fluctuated and a strong vertical shear was noted, suggesting turbulence might have existed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPIREPs (Pilot Reports)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFour PIREPs were made within 100 miles of the accident location around the time of the time of the accident. Each reported cloud bases near as low as 400 ft, and cloud tops at 2,000 ft. One of the reports described the air as \"smooth\" and none reported the presence of turbulence or windshear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRPORT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nILG was located 4 miles south of Wilmington, Delaware, at an elevation of 80 ft msl. The airport had an operating control tower that was open from 0730 to 0000 daily. Runway 1 was equipped with a medium intensity approach lighting system and runway alignment indicator lights.&#x0D;\nReview of radar data, and interviews with two pilots operating on the ground at ILG just before the accident, revealed that the ILS critical area was free of aircraft or vehicular obstructions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccident Site Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest in a ditch about 3,200 ft before the runway threshold and right of the runway centerline. The helicopter was fragmented and partially consumed by postimpact fire. All of the helicopter's major components were located in the main wreckage area. The odor of Jet A fuel was noted at the accident site. The top post of a fence located about 15 ft from and parallel to the main wreckage location was cut at a 45° angle. In addition, about 5 ft directly beneath the cut post, the fence was damaged, and part of a rotor blade was embedded in it. Further, a section of wood from the fence was located that exhibited 45° angle cuts on either end.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe and Rotor System Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit and forward section of the fuselage were partially consumed by fire. Control continuity of the cyclic and collective was confirmed to the rotor head from the cockpit through several breaks and fractures. The cyclic, collective, and antitorque pedals were separated and found in the main wreckage. Not all sections of the control system were located because they were destroyed by impact forces and fire damage; however, no preimpact anomalies were noted with the sections of the control system that were found.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe standby attitude indicator was removed from the cockpit and disassembled. Rotational scoring was noted on the gyro housing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rotor head and transmission remained attached to each other but were separated from the airframe due to impact forces. The control actuator assembly was examined, and all tie rods remained intact. All four blades of the main rotor remained attached to the rotor head. One blade exhibited impact damage and was not thermally damaged. the three other blades were consumed by fire. All of the pitch-change links remained attached to the rotor head. The transmission mounts were separated from the helicopter. The tailboom was impact-separated and consumed by fire. The fenestron was impact-separated. Several fenestron vanes were bent in the opposite direction of rotation and exhibited rotational scoring. In addition, a few of the vanes were impact separated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Examinations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left engine was impact-separated from the engine mounts. The reduction gearbox and the turbomachine were impact-separated. The compressor turbine disc and compressor could be rotated by hand. The left engine power turbine was removed, and the drive shaft exhibited torsional deformation and fractures. The power turbine wheel exhibited rotational scoring.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right engine was impact-separated from the engine mounts. The right engine power turbine was removed, and the drive shaft exhibited torsional deformation and fractures. The power turbine wheel exhibited rotational scoring.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Control System Unit and WU Examinations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an engine control system unit that included electronic engine control units and data collection units for each engine. Thermal and impact damage precluded the download of any data from the units.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was also equipped with a warning unit (WU) that provided visual and audio indications when warning conditions were triggered. The WU accommodated several warnings that were chronologically recorded but not timestamped. The warnings appeared red when illuminated and were unlit when inactive. Each warning simultaneously initiated an audible 'gong'. The audio for some of the warnings could be silenced using the audio reset button on the top of the cyclic control stick, but a visual warning could not be cleared while the warning condition remained. All warning gongs were audible to the pilot and observers through their headsets.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe WU was removed from the wreckage, disassembled, and a non-volatile memory chip was removed for data download. Examination of the data revealed that the engine start-up was consistent with the expected and normal engine startup warnings, as well as an expected autopilot warning. Subsequently, the rotor rpm warning illuminated multiple times as the rotor rpm cycled between normal range (95% to 106%) and greater-than-106% rotor rpm multiple times and then the greater-than- 112% rotor rpm warning illuminated while a gong sounded. After that, the autopilot warning illuminated, and the rotor rpm warnings cycled between greater than 106% and 112% and less than 95% multiple times. While the WU preserved the sequence of the annunciated warnings, it did not record timestamps, so it could not be determined when the rpm warnings occurred beyond what order they occurred in.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter flight manual, the autopilot warning light would illuminate when the autopilot was disengaged or if there was a failure of the autopilot module. In the event the autopilot was disengaged or a failure occurred, the pilot would actively have his/her hands on the flight controls and land the helicopter as soon as practicable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe State of Delaware Division of Forensic Science, Wilmington, Delaware, performed an autopsy of the pilot. The autopsy report indicated that the pilot died as a result of \"multiple blunt force injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, conducted toxicological testing of specimens from the pilot. The testing was negative for ethanol and tested drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMetro Aviation Operations Manual&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInstrument Training&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the company's operations manual, all pilots were required to go through initial and recurrent training in helicopter operations. The recurrent training required 4 hours of instrument training every year. In addition, its helicopter instrument proficiency program, which could be used for flight crew to maintain instrument proficiency skills and currency under the applicable regulations required quarterly checks during which the pilots would perform a training flight with a safety pilot that could also qualify as an instrument proficiency check in accordance with FAA regulations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nApproved Sources to Obtain Weather Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operations manual, the approved sources that pilots could use to obtain weather information included anything published by the National Weather Service (NWS) or an NWS-approved source. According to another company pilot, he and other company pilots often used the NWS HEMS Weather Tool, terminal area forecasts, ForeFlight, and Weathermeister (an online commercial service) to obtain weather information.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHelicopter Weather Minimums – Precision Approaches&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operations manual, the weather minimums needed for a straight-in category I precision instrument approach for helicopter operations, when a medium intensity approach lighting system with runway alignment indicator lights was present, was 1/4 mile visibility or 1,600 ft of runway visual range when the helicopter reached 200 ft agl while on the glideslope.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAir Traffic Control and Pilot Interactions&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1128, the pilot first contacted Philadelphia (PHL) Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and reported the helicopter was flying at 4,000 ft msl and was headed direct to Cedar Lake (VCN). The radar south arrival (SA) controller issued the current altimeter and advised the pilot that automatic terminal information service information \"tango\" was current at ILG. The pilot acknowledged and said he would advise when he had received that weather information. The controller then provided radar vectors to the helicopter for the ILS approach to runway 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1135, the pilot requested an IFR clearance back to ACY after completion of his instrument approach into ILG. The SA controller advised the pilot that the next controller would be able to accommodate his request.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1139, the SA controller transferred communications with the pilot to the South Departure (SD) controller and advised the pilot the receiving controller had been made aware of his request to pick up his clearance to ACY following the completion of the ILS approach. The pilot acknowledged and established contact with the SD controller.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe SD controller continued vectoring the helicopter for the ILS runway 1 approach until about 1150, when he cleared the pilot for the approach with a restriction to maintain at or above 2,000 ft until established on the approach. The pilot acknowledged. While vectoring the helicopter, the controller instructed the pilot to turn the helicopter to intercept the ILS approach course, which resulted in the helicopter intercepting the approach course at a 30° angle, about 1 nautical mile outside the approach gate (see figure 2). The SD controller then transferred communications with the pilot to the local (LC) controller at ILG ATCT.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Radar flight track of the final segment of the accident flight. Key points along the route of flight have been depicted in order to illustrate the final approach intercept with relation to the final approach fix and approach gate.At 1150, the pilot first contacted the LC at ILG ATCT and reported crossing the HADIN fix at 2,000 ft. The LC issued the current wind and cleared the pilot to land runway 1. The pilot acknowledged with a correct readback.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1151, a position relief briefing (PRB) took place on the LC position. The helicopter was the only traffic being handled by the ILG ATCT and was included in the PRB. Directly following the PRB, at 1152, the pilot reported that he would like to go around, start his missed approach, and come back around for another approach. The on-coming LC asked the pilot if he had previously coordinated the missed approach with PHL ATCT, and the pilot said \"uh, we didn't want to ma'am.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1153, the on-coming LC asked the pilot if he was having trouble getting the airport in sight, and the pilot responded that he had received \"some bad vectors at the very end\" and wanted to \"just line up and come back around again.\" The on-coming LC instructed the pilot to fly the missed approach, and then coordinated the approach with PHL ATCT. There was no response from the pilot, and radar contact was lost at 1153:18. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe on-coming LC attempted to contact the pilot for the next several minutes, and at 1157 stated to the PHL ATCT SD controller that they could see black smoke and could not reach the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAir Traffic Control (ATC) Guidance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA Order 7110.65W, \"Air Traffic Control,\" chapter 5, section 9, paragraph 5-9-2, for final approach course interception, the controller was to assign headings that would permit final approach course intercept on a track that does not exceed a 20° angle if an aircraft intercepts the approach course less than 2 miles from the approach gate, or a 30° angle if an aircraft intercepts the approach course 2 miles or more from the approach gate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPage 2-6-1 and 2-6-2, section 2-6-3, of the order stated, in part, the following regarding air traffic controller requirements to solicit and disseminate significant PIREP information to pilots:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSignificant PIREP [pilot report] information includes reports of strong frontal activity, squall lines, thunderstorms, light to severe icing, wind shear and turbulence (including clear air turbulence) of moderate or greater intensity, volcanic eruptions and volcanic ash clouds, detection of sulfur gases (SO2 or H2S) in the cabin, and other conditions pertinent to flight safety.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\na. Solicit PIREPs when requested or when one of the following conditions exists or is forecast for your area of jurisdiction:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1. Ceilings at or below 5,000 feet. These PIREPs must include cloud base/top reports when feasible.&#x0D;\n2. Visibility (surface or aloft) at or less than 5 miles.&#x0D;\n3. Thunderstorms and related phenomena.&#x0D;\n4. Turbulence of moderate degree or greater.&#x0D;\n5. Icing of light degree or greater.&#x0D;\n6. Wind shear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nd. Handle PIREPs as follows:&#x0D;\n1. Relay pertinent PIREP information to concerned aircraft in a timely manner.&#x0D;\n2. En Route. Relay all operationally significant PIREPs to the facility weather coordinator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the ATC transcripts revealed that the air traffic controllers that interacted with pilot did not solicit or disseminate PIREPs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nChapter 3 section 1, paragraph 3-1-9, \"Use of Tower Radar Displays,\" stated, in part, the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUncertified tower display workstations must be used only as an aid to assist controllers in visually locating aircraft or in determining their spatial relationship to known geographical points. Radar services and traffic advisories are not to be provided using uncertified tower display workstations…local controllers may use certified tower radar displays…to determine an aircraft's identification, exact location, or spatial relationship to other aircraft…to provide aircraft with radar traffic advisories…to provide a direction or suggested headings to VFR [visual flight rules] aircraft as a method for radar identification or as an advisory aid navigation…to provide information and instructions to aircraft operating within the surface area for which the tower has responsibility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the ATC transcripts revealed that the tower controller did not provide approach guidance to the accident helicopter in the form of radar vectors. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWorkload Management&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21A) stated the following regarding workload management:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne component of Single-Pilot Resource Management is workload or task management. Research shows that humans have a limited capacity for information. Once information flow exceeds the person's ability to mentally process the information, any additional information becomes unattended or displaces other tasks and information already being processed [See Figure 3, which depicts task requirements and pilot capabilities in reference to a margin of safety.] Once this situation occurs, only two alternatives exist: shed the unimportant tasks or perform all tasks at a less than optimal level. Like an overloaded electrical circuit, either the consumption must be reduced or a circuit failure is experienced.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. A depiction of task requirements and pilot capabilities in reference to a margin of safety. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSpatial Disorientation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25B) contained guidance on spatial disorientation, which stated the following: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n…under normal flight conditions, when there is a visual reference to the horizon and ground, the sensory system in the inner ear helps to identify the pitch, roll, and yaw movements of the airplane. When visual contact with the horizon is lost, the vestibular system becomes unreliable. Without visual references outside the airplane, there are many situations where combinations of normal motions and forces can create convincing illusions that are difficult to overcome. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe handbook also advised, \"unless a pilot has many hours of training in instrument flight, flight in reduced visibility or at night when the horizon is not visible should be avoided.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirplane Flying Handbook&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AFM stated the following about spatial disorientation:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot must believe what the flight instruments show about the airplane's attitude regardless of what the natural senses tell. The vestibular sense (motion sensing by the inner ear) can and will confuse the pilot. Because of inertia, the sensory areas of the inner ear cannot detect slight changes in airplane attitude, nor can they accurately send the attitude changes which occur at a uniform rate over a period of time. On the other hand, false sensations are often generated, leading the pilot to believe the attitude of the airplane has changed when, in fact, it has not. These false sensations result in the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Advisory Circular 60-4A, \"Pilot's Spatial Disorientation,\" stated the following on spatial disorientation:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe attitude of an aircraft is generally determined by reference to the natural horizon or other visual reference with the surface. If neither horizon nor surface references exist, the attitude of an aircraft must be determined by artificial means from the flight instruments. Sight, supported by other senses, allows the pilot to maintain orientation. However, during periods of low visibility, the supporting senses sometimes conflict with what is seen. When this happens, a pilot is particularly vulnerable to disorientation. The degree of orientation may vary considerably with individual pilots. Spatial disorientation to a pilot means simply the inability to tell which way is 'up.'…Surface references and the natural horizon may at times become obscured, although visibility may be above flight rule minimums. Lack of natural horizon or such reference is common on over water flights, at night, and especially at night in extremely sparsely populated areas, or in low visibility conditions…. The disoriented pilot may place the aircraft in a dangerous attitude… therefore, the use of flight instruments is essential to maintain proper attitude when encountering any of the elements which may result in spatial disorientation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "On the afternoon of the accident, the pilot was scheduled to participate in a fundraising event in which he would drop golf balls from his helicopter. The pilot departed his home airport and flew to a private uncharted airfield with a turf runway, which was about halfway between the departure airport and the fundraising event location but not directly between the departure and destination locations. Radar data for the flight ended when the helicopter was about 800 ft north of the accident site and proceeding along a northwest track away from the accident site. The amount of flight time and the track after the radar data ended could not be determined. A witness reported hearing the engine as the helicopter approached the area; the engine noise continued until he heard the sounds of rotor blades striking trees and a subsequent explosion. The helicopter struck a 60-ft-tall tree at the edge of a tree line surrounding a 2-acre residential lawn, which was located near the runway extended centerline and about 300 ft from the approach end of the runway. The debris path was oriented on a heading of 325°, and the runway was oriented on a heading of about 330°. The runway had not recently been maintained or used, as indicated by the 4-ft-tall grass on the entire runway.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGiven the available evidence, the investigation could not determine why the pilot flew to the private uncharted airfield. The pilot's destination was about 13 miles northwest of the accident site, and it is unknown if or where he intended to stop along the way. No golf ball remnants were found at the accident scene, and there was no indication if the pilot planned to pick up the golf balls along the way to or at the destination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tall grass on the runway made the runway itself an unlikely planned landing location. The pilot was not likely performing a forced landing to the runway (or the residential lawn) because after arriving in the area, he initially flew away from the runway and lawn for an unknown amount of time before apparently lining up with the runway prior to impact. The witness information indicated that the engine was operating, and the fragmentation of the main rotor blades showed that the rotor system was rotating. Also, examination of the airframe and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough postaccident toxicological testing detected tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in the pilot's cavity blood, the blood concentration level at the time of the accident could not be reliably determined due to postmortem redistribution, during which THC levels may rise or fall. Thus, the toxicology results were inconclusive regarding when the pilot's marijuana use occurred and whether it would have had performance-impairing effects during the accident flight.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The four-seat Bell-Carson model 47G Super C4 helicopter was manufactured in 1962. It was assembled by Carson Helicopters primarily from components manufactured by Bell Helicopters. The helicopter was powered by a 235-horsepower, six-cylinder Franklin 6V350A engine. The helicopter's logbooks were consumed by a postcrash fire, so the helicopter's maintenance history and airframe and engine operational times could not be determined. - On April 21, 2017, about 1632 eastern daylight time, a privately owned and operated Bell-Carson 47G Super C-4 helicopter, N865Z, was destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire near a private uncharted airfield in Timmonsville, South Carolina. The private pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was privately owned and operated as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed for the local flight. The flight originated from Huggins Memorial Airport (58J) in Timmonsville about 1628.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's family, the purpose of the flight was to conduct a \"golf ball drop\" at a fundraising event about 13 miles northwest of the accident site. The pilot's family was not aware of the helicopter's planned route of flight, including any possible stops along the way.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of radar data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which did not include altitude data, revealed that, after the helicopter departed 58J (where the helicopter was based), it flew northwest in the general direction of the golf ball drop location. The last recorded radar data point was about 800 ft north of the accident site. At that time, the helicopter was flying northwest, away from the accident site, and its track was not aligned with the turf runway at the private uncharted airfield or the accident site. The remaining flight time and track after the radar data end, and before the helicopter collided with trees and terrain, could not be determine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness at the uncharted private airfield residence, located about ¼ mile from the accident site, was outside at the time of the accident flight, heard the helicopter nearby, and thought it might have been approaching the airfield. The witness was unable to see the helicopter due to a tree line that blocked his view. He reported, \"at first you could hear the rotor blades, then they got quieter and the engine sound got louder.\" Afterward, he heard \"the rotors hitting the trees and the explosion of the crash\" and saw a black plume of smoke rising from his neighbor's yard. - An autopsy of the pilot was performed by Newberry Pathology Associates, Newberry, South Carolina. The pilot's cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA Forensic Sciences Laboratory identified tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the primary psychoactive compound in marijuana) in the pilot's liver specimens (0.0374 µg/ml) and cavity blood specimens (0.0185 µg/ml).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe testing also identified tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid (THC-COOH, an inactive metabolite of THC) in the pilot's liver (0.3438 µg/ml), urine (0.3087 µg/ml), and cavity blood (0.0253 µg/ml) specimens. Cavity blood can be redistributed postmortem from other areas of the body, so the postmortem cavity blood level might be different than the level at the time of an accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Drugs and Human Performance Fact Sheet for marijuana states the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt is difficult to establish a relationship between a person's THC blood or plasma concentration and performance impairing effects. Concentrations of parent drug and metabolite are very dependent on pattern of use as well as dose...most behavioral and physiological effects return to baseline levels within 3-5 hours after drug use, although some investigators have demonstrated residual effects in specific behaviors up to 24 hours, such as complex divided attention tasks. Psychomotor impairment can persist after the perceived high has dissipated. - Florence Regional Airport (FLO), Florence, South Carolina, located about 14 miles east of the accident site, was the nearest weather reporting station. At 1653, the reported weather included wind from 220° at 12 knots, visibility 10 miles, few clouds at 6,500 ft, temperature 31°C, dewpoint 15°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.90 inches of mercury. - According to FAA records, the pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and rotorcraft-helicopter. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on September 26, 2014, at which time he reported 3,600 hours of total flight experience. His medical certificate expired in September 2016. The pilot's logbook was not recovered, so his flight experience in this make and model helicopter, and  the total number of hours that he flew between the time of his medical certificate and the time of the accident could not be determined. - All major components of the helicopter were accounted for at the accident site. The initial impact point was a freshly cut treetop about 60 ft above the ground and at the edge of tree line. The tail rotor personnel guard and left horizontal stabilizer were found near the base of the damaged tree along with several freshly cut branches.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage path was about 100 ft in length and oriented on a magnetic heading of about 325°. Fragments of the main rotor blades were found in all directions from the main wreckage and within a radius of about 300 ft. The initial ground scar was about 90 ft beyond the first tree strike. The main wreckage came to rest on a 2-acre residential lawn about 100 ft to the right of the turf runway extended centerline and about 300 ft from the runway threshold. The turf runway was oriented 330° had not been recently maintained or used; the grass along the entire length of the runway was about 4 ft tall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest inverted and oriented on a heading of about 210°. The helicopter was partially consumed by fire. The tail rotor gearbox was attached to the tailboom, which was separated at the aft center frame and was located about 50 ft southeast of the main wreckage. The right landing skid was separated from both cross-tubes, and the left skid remained attached to the front cross-tube.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine, transmission, and rotor mast remained together and were partially attached to the airframe and rotated about 90° aft. The main rotor hub remained mounted to the mast with both blade grips attached. The two wooden main rotor blades were fragmented with pieces scattered throughout the accident site. The metal spar and a 10-ft-long section of blade forward of the spar remained attached to one of the blade grips. The metal spar and a 1-ft section of blade remained attached to the other blade grip.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor driveshaft was bent upward just forward of the tail rotor gearbox input quill, and tree bark was observed where the driveshaft was bent. The tail rotor driveshaft and gearbox could not be rotated due to impact damage, but, after removal of the bent driveshaft, the tail rotor gearbox rotated freely. Both metal tail rotor blades were fracture separated just outboard of the blade grips. The blades exhibited minor bending damage but were mostly intact. The blades showed no chordwise scratches or leading-edge damage other than those in the area of the separation fractures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth cyclic control pedestal assemblies were damaged and found separated from their mounts. Remnants of the collective control stick were found separated from the structure and mostly consumed by fire. The pilot-side and copilot-side anti-torque pedal assemblies remained connected to one another but were separated from the helicopter structure. Two cables were found attached to the damaged tail rotor quadrant; they were continuous to the overload breaks at the aft center frame. One cable was found attached to the tail rotor pitch control assembly with an overload break near the forward end of the tailboom. The tail rotor pitch control mechanism moved smoothly when the cable was pulled.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine accessory section was damaged, and fragments of the engine case were separated, exposing the accessory gears. The starter, hydraulic pump, and both magnetos were separated from the engine and were fire damaged. The carburetor was partially attached to the engine; the mixture control remained attached; and the throttle control input rod end was fractured, consistent with overload. The carburetor heat plenum was separated from its mount, and the control cable remained attached to the plenum. The engine remained attached to the transmission. The crankshaft could not be manually rotated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMost of the avionics components were partially or completely consumed by fire. The transponder could not be identified in the wreckage, its setting (STBY ON, or ALT) could not be determined. Burned paper consistent with pages of maintenance records were found throughout the main wreckage area. No remnants of golf balls were found. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "As part of a power line construction project, the helicopter was stringing sock line between power line towers. The pilot was in the process of hooking a needle that was attached to a 50-ft long line to the tower structure in order to pull a sock line that was attached to the needle through the center of the tower. The helicopter was equipped with a side pull hook assembly that attached a cargo hook to the left side of the helicopter. The 50-ft long line was attached to the cargo hook, and a grappling hook was attached to the other end of the long line. The grappling hook was connected to the metal needle, which was to be temporarily attached to a horizontal cross-member of the tower. A cell phone video of the accident sequence revealed that the pilot made two unsuccessful attempts to hook the needle to a horizontal cross-member. On the third attempt, the helicopter flew backward until the needle became entangled with the tower's vertical lattice, which tethered the helicopter to the tower via the long line and resulted in the pilot losing control of the helicopter. As the helicopter continued to apply force on the long line, the needle's aft loop impacted the tower and subsequently separated from the needle. When the needle fractured it ended the helicopter's tether to the tower. The helicopter continued backward to a near vertical pitch attitude then rotated about its vertical axis. As the helicopter rotated and descended, the long line became entangled with the main rotor blades, and the main rotor blades impacted the top of the cabin and the tailboom. The tailboom separated about mid span and impacted the ground next to the rest of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the fracture surfaces of the needle showed evidence of ductile overstress separation. There was no evidence of a preexisting fracture or crack in the needle. The fracture of the needle was most likely the result of the needle impacting the tower. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe side pull system was certified for a maximum side pull load of 1,900 lbs., which was to be safeguarded by a breakaway swivel and shear pin. The video of the accident sequence revealed that the long line remained attached to the helicopter even after the needle became entangled with and impacted the tower. The breakaway swivel did not appear to separate before the long line became entangled in the helicopter's rotor blades. The breakaway swivel, its shear pin, the two carabiners that hooked to either side of the barrel swivel, and the upper portion of the long line were not found during the investigation. It is likely that the swivel was forcibly disconnected from the side hook when the long line became tightly wrapped around the rotor hub, and then the missing components were ejected from the rotor hub when the long line broke. An examination of these components was not possible; therefore, the investigation could not verify the type of swivel and shear pin that were installed during the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA study of the accident video revealed that shortly before the needle became entangled with the tower, the helicopter initiated a rearward movement. As the helicopter flew backward the needle rotated/rolled about its longitudinal axis from a vertical orientation to a more horizontal orientation, which moved the leading edge of the needle laterally toward the tower until it became entangled with the tower. The helicopter continued to move backward and pulled the needle's aft hook into contact with the tower, which tethered the helicopter to the tower via the long line. The long line force applied on the helicopter before the accident sequence started was calculated to be about 875 lbs, which was less than half the rated force of the side pull hook assembly. Therefore, it is unlikely that the long line force applied on the helicopter before the needle contacted the tower contributed to the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe force required to fracture the needle's aft loop was calculated to be 73,790 lbs., which is nearly 40 times greater than the load required to shear the breakaway swivel shear pin. Since the breakaway swivel could not be located the investigation was unable to determine why it did not separate as designed during the event when the helicopter was tethered to the tower. In the absence of the breakaway swivel and shear pin, there is no evidence that system did not function as designed and certified relevant to the certification basis of the STC. Based on the evidence, the system should have separated due to tensile loads transmitted to the shear pin at the time the helicopter became tethered then moved away from the tower.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Side Pull Hook Assembly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a Colorado Helicopters, Inc., Side Pull Hook Assembly (figure 3) per supplemental type certificate (STC) SH5230NM. According to the STC holder, the purpose of the assembly is to quickly rig a helicopter for pulling a sock line on power line construction projects. The assembly featured mechanical and electric cargo hook release mechanisms. The system is certified for a maximum side pull load of 1,900 lbs., which is safeguarded by a breakaway swivel; the two-piece breakaway swivel is held together with a calibrated shear pin. The STC holder noted that if the airframe is about to be overloaded, the shear pin is designed to break and allow for the long line to fall away from the helicopter; no unusual attitudes will result, and the helicopter should easily come to a hover.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3 – Side Pull Hook Assembly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNeedle&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe frame of the needle was made of steel tubing; the forward and aft sections of the needle were connected in the middle by a hinge bracket. Each section of the needle featured a closed loop with a straight open hook extending aft; the straight hooks (see figure 4) allowed the pilot to temporarily attach the needle to a horizontal cross-member of the tower and then reposition the helicopter. The aft end of the needle was connected to the metal sock line via metal carabiners and a non-breakaway swivel. The weight of the needle was about 200 lbs. Figure 4 shows the multicolored needle connected to the long line via the grappling hook. The photo depicted in figure 4 was captured a few minutes before the accident and is indicative of the exact configuration during the accident sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4 – Needle with Notations - On March 14, 2017, at 1546 eastern daylight time, an MD Helicopters 369FF, N530KD, impacted terrain during a power line construction flight near Chalmers, Indiana. The commercial pilot was fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to a private individual and operated by Rogers Helicopters, Inc., under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 as an external load operation. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan had been filed. The helicopter departed from a staging area near the accident site about 1530 for the local flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flight was to thread a braided metal sock line through the center of a tower structure and pull the sock line to the next tower. The helicopter was equipped with a side pull hook assembly that attached the cargo hook to the left cabin step position on the helicopter. A 50-ft blue nylon long line with a protective sheath was attached to the cargo hook, and a grappling hook was attached to the other end of the long line. The grappling hook was connected to a large metal needle that enabled the pilot to thread the sock line through the tower structure. The needle was equipped with two hooks that were used to attach it to the tower structure. To thread the sock line, the pilot hooked the needle to the tower, released the grappling hook, moved the long line to the opposite side of the tower, and picked up the needle with the grappling hook.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tension on the sock line was controlled by a triple drum puller located about 2 miles (and 10 towers) north. Each of the three drums contained sock line for one of the three phases of the tower as seen in figure 1. The puller featured a manual brake that was operated by a power line construction employee. The employee and the pilot communicated via radio as the pilot would announce his operational intentions. The employee stated that the pilot had threaded the sock line through nine towers. The pilot announced over the radio that he was slowing and approaching the tenth tower. The employee later heard yelling over the radio and then silence. The amount of brake applied on the sock line at the time of the accident was not determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness provided a 3-minute cell phone video of the events leading to the accident and the entire accident sequence. The video revealed that the pilot was attempting to attach the needle's forward hook to the tower structure (figure 1) when the accident occurred.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 – Image from Accident Video with Notations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the video showed that the pilot attempted twice to hook the needle to the tower and was unsuccessful each time. Before the third attempt, the helicopter wobbled several times. On the third attempt, the helicopter flew backward until the needle impacted the tower. The helicopter continued a backward motion, pitched up, then descended with the tailboom pointed at the ground (figure 2). The needle's aft loop, which the grappling hook was attached to, separated from the needle and was thrown to the south. While still airborne, the helicopter made a descending 180° clockwise rotation, as viewed from above, with the long line still attached. The rotation stopped as the helicopter faced north then rolled left about 80°. The long line became entangled with the main rotor blades, and then the blades impacted the top of the cabin and the tailboom. The tailboom separated about mid span, and both the tailboom and the rest of the helicopter descended and impacted the ground. There was no evidence of a post-crash fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 – Image from Accident Video with Notations - Central Indiana Forensic Associates, LLC, Fishers, Indiana, completed an autopsy on the pilot and determined that the cause of death was blunt force trauma. The FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, conducted toxicology testing, which revealed no drugs or other substances. - Evidence from the accident video and witness statements revealed that the weather conditions consisted of an overcast cloud layer, light and intermittent snow, and wind gusts of unknown speeds reported by witnesses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne witness reported that he was sitting in his truck facing west at the intersection of the adjacent county roads. His windows were down, and he felt a gust of wind at the time of the accident. - The pilot's personal logbooks were not found during the investigation. A review of the pilot's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate application indicated that, as of October 12, 2016, the pilot had accumulated 14,975 hours of flight experience, all of which were in rotorcraft. The company duty log sheets revealed that the pilot flew 336.7 hours in 2016 and 12.8 hours in 2017. - Needle Testing&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPortions of the damaged needle assembly were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for examination and testing; photos of the as-received portions are shown in figure 7.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 7 – Needle Damage&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe needle assembly contained closed loops at the center and the forward end. The top portion of each closed loop also contained an open hook portion that faced aft. A visual examination of the needle assembly revealed that the aft closed loop (the point of attachment of the grappling hook) fractured at two locations. The fractures were through the round solid bar portion and intersected a portion of the weld at the frame portion. A bench binocular microscope examination of the fracture faces revealed rough texture features on slant planes consistent with ductile-bending overstress separation, with no evidence of a preexisting crack, such as fatigue crack. The welds at the fracture face showed no evidence of defects such as porosity.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA metallurgical section was made through the loop portions in the areas indicated by arrows 1 and 2 in figure 7 to obtain a 0.3-inch-thick disc portion from the 1-inch diameter solid round bar. Rockwell hardness (HRB) testing of the flat cut faces, perpendicular to the length of the solid round bar, produced average hardness values of 93 HRB, which converted to a tensile strength of about 94,000 lbs. per square inch. The load required to fracture the 1-inch solid round bar from the needle assembly was calculated by multiplying the approximate tensile strength by the cross-sectional area of the solid round bar. The load required to fracture the 1-inch solid round bar under constant tensile load was calculated to be 73,790 lbs., which is nearly 40 times greater than the load required to break the side hook's breakaway swivel shear pin.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVideo Study&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe video study estimated the orientation of the helicopter during the accident sequence and the orientation and magnitude of the force vector that the long line was applying on the helicopter before the helicopter became tethered to the tower.  The maximum amount of force that the long line applied to the helicopter before the helicopter became tethered to the tower was 875 ±130 lbs. The helicopter orientation and the orientation of the long line force vector were documented graphically in the video study, which is available in the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe video study showed that shortly before the needle first contacted the tower, the helicopter moved backward, and the helicopter yaw angle was about 45° with respect to the tower. In normal operation before the accident, the needle was oriented vertically with the grappling hook attached near the top center of the needle. As the helicopter moved backward, the needle rotated/rolled about its longitudinal axis to a more horizontal orientation. The rotation moved the leading edge of the needle closer to the tower until it contacted the tower and became entangled in the tower's vertical lattice. The helicopter continued to move backward and pulled the needle's aft hook into contact with the tower, which tethered the helicopter to the tower via the long line.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe video study revealed that the long line remained attached to the helicopter after the needle impacted the tower. The side hook's breakaway swivel did not appear to separate before the long line became entangled in the helicopter's rotor blades. - The helicopter's fuselage came to rest on its left side (figure 5), the same side as the pilot's seat. The aft section of the tailboom came to rest about 5 ft to the north of the fuselage. The main rotor blades separated from the rotor hub and came to rest to the south of the fuselage. The tailboom exhibited blue transfer marks, and the long line sheath was entangled in the tail rotor assembly. The horizontal and vertical stabilizers separated from the end of the tailboom. The lower portion of the blue long line was entangled in the main rotor hub and extended over the right side of the fuselage and right skid toward the tailboom. The grappling hook remained attached to the long line and was partially embedded in the soil.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5 – Main Wreckage&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe long line was separated in tension overload near the top of the line, a few feet from the cargo hook. Figure 3 shows the top portion of the long line still attached to the helicopter before the accident and figure 6 shows the postaccident condition of the long line. The cargo hook was found open at the accident site. The breakaway swivel, its shear pin, the two carabiners that hooked to either side of the swivel, and the upper portion of the long line were not found during the investigation. The aft end of the needle remained connected to the sock line via a non-breakaway swivel. The needle's fractured aft loop was found about 50 yards south of the accident site. Except for the fracture after loop, the rest of the needle remained intact with ground impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 6 – Long line, Sheath, and Grappling Hook&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident test confirmed mechanical and electrical continuity to the cargo hook. The mechanical switch on the cyclic was actuated, and the hook opened as expected. An electrical source was applied to the hook wiring, and the hook opened as expected.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe trim switch was fractured from the cyclic stick. The trim switch wires were exposed where they fractured from the trim switch, and electrical continuity was confirmed from the trim switch wires to the trim actuator motors and trim circuit breaker. Physical continuity between the wires was also confirmed, and no electrical shorts were found. A portion of the airframe electrical wiring was damaged due to ground impact and did not allow for a complete examination. Extensive examination and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the helicopter's trim system did not reveal any preimpact anomalies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMultiple postaccident examinations of the wreckage conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigators with technical assistance provided by representatives from the operator, the helicopter manufacturer, and the engine manufacturer did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or failures with the engine or airframe that would have precluded normal operation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was repositioning the helicopter from an offshore oil platform to the operator's home base in visual meteorological conditions. When the helicopter did not return as expected, the operator initiated a search; the helicopter wreckage was found in a shallow marsh area just off shore. No radio distress calls were received from the pilot, and the skid-mounted emergency float system was not deployed. Onboard flight-following equipment recorded a straight flight path tracking directly to the intended destination with a gradual descent just prior to impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccident flight data extracted from the helicopter's engine control unit did not show any faults with the engine. Detailed examinations of the helicopter's airframe, drive system, and flight controls did not reveal any preimpact anomalies. Examination and full teardown of the engine did not reveal any anomalies and indicated that the engine was operating at the time of impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe deformations were consistent with a slightly nose-low and left-skid-down attitude at the time of impact; therefore, it is unlikely that the pilot experienced a loss of control. Given the absence of mechanical anomalies, the fact that the pilot did not make a distress call or activate the emergency float system, and the helicopter's relatively straight recorded flight path, it is likely that the helicopter was operating normally at the time of impact. Further, toxicology testing and autopsy findings did not indicate any evidence of pilot impairment. It could not be determined why the pilot failed to recognize the helicopter's descent and maintain a proper altitude above the water.",
    "FactualNarrative": "After the accident, the operator implemented a Flight Operational Quality Assurance (FOQA) program to install Flight Data Management (FDM) equipment in all company aircraft to capture flight data, cockpit audio, and imagery on all flights. - Westwind Helicopters leased the helicopter, serial number (S/N) 53182, from GM Leasing in April 2015.  It had a total airframe time of 9,146.8 hours at the time of the accident. The helicopter was equipped with an Allison 250C47B turbo shaft engine (S/N CAE847222) with a total time of 15,510.6 hours. According to maintenance records provided by the operator, the most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on February 16, 2017, at 9,125.5 airframe hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMaintenance records indicated compliance with all required scheduled maintenance inspections, applicable service bulletins, and applicable airworthiness directives. A review of the maintenance logbooks by the NTSB IIC did not reveal any uncorrected scheduled or unscheduled maintenance actions. - On February 27, 2017, about 1033 central standard time, a Bell 407 helicopter, N1371, was destroyed when it impacted marshy water 15 miles southwest of Houma, Louisiana (HUM). The commercial pilot was fatally injured. The repositioning flight was operated by Westwind Helicopters under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Regulations (CFR) Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed throughout the area and a company flight plan was activated. The flight originated at 1014 from offshore oil platform South Timbalier ST37, Gulf of Mexico.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBefore the accident flight, the helicopter had completed a 14 CFR Part 135 passenger flight from HUM to ST37, dropping off 2 passengers. The passengers reported that the flight to ST37 was normal. According to the operator, the pilot was to return the helicopter to HUM for a minor repair of an engine cowling fastener. The pilot was the only person on board for the approximate 30-minute flight to HUM.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an on-board flight tracking system (Sky Connect). After takeoff from ST37, six flight path data points were recorded at 2-minute intervals and showed the helicopter on a northwest heading. Sky Connect data showed the flight path of the helicopter flying direct toward HUM on a northwest heading. Sky Connect Flight Path Data Points:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1  Heading 207 degrees, altitude 108 feet, ground speed 8 knots (ST37 Departure)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n2  Heading 337 degrees, altitude 728 feet, ground speed 148 knots&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n3  Heading 336 degrees, altitude 699 feet, ground speed 144 knots&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n4  Heading 336 degree, altitude 486 feet, ground speed 144 knots&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n5  Heading 336 degrees, altitude 548 feet, ground speed 150 knots&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n6  Heading 336 degrees, altitude 374 feet, ground speed 148 knots (Last Recorded Point)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Figure. Sky Connect Flight Path&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe figure shows the helicopter's altitude, heading, and ground speed; ST37 is located at the right of the figure. The last Sky Connect data point was at 1024, indicating an altitude of 374 ft and ground speed of 148 knots. Sky Connect issued an \"Overdue\" alarm at 1033. At 1103, company flight monitoring personnel dispatched a search helicopter, and the wreckage was found at 1135 about 15 miles south-southeast of HUM.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no reported witnesses to the accident. There were no radio or distress calls heard from the helicopter, and the helicopter's Sky Connect emergency button was not activated. - The Terrebonne Medical Examiner's Office, Houma, Louisiana, performed an autopsy of the pilot on February 28, 2017. The cause of death was blunt trauma.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology testing of the pilot. No drugs, ethanol, or carbon monoxide were detected. - At 0950, the weather observation at HUM included wind from 150° at 12 knots gusting to 17 knots, visibility 5 statute miles with haze, scattered clouds at 1,000 ft and a broken ceiling at 2,200 ft, temperature 24°C, dew point 21°C, and an altimeter setting of 30.12 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe search pilot reported that the conditions in the area of the accident site included 5-7 miles visibility with ceilings above 700 ft about 1130. - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument ratings. He was hired by Westwind Helicopters on July 17, 2016. His total flight time as of February 27, 2017 was 2,266 hours, all of which was in light helicopters. His total flight time in the accident helicopter make and model was 120 hours. He had flown 140 flight hours in single-engine helicopters in the 90 days before the accident. According to pilot training records provided by the operator, the pilot was current and qualified in offshore Part 135 flight operations. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second-class medical certificate was issued in June 2016 with no limitations. - The ECU was transported to Triumph Engine Controls in West Hartford, Connecticut, for data extraction. The accident fight data did not show any faults with the engine. The operator reported that the normal airspeed for a return flight from offshore is typically about 120 knots. The Sky Connect data showed ground speeds between 144 and 148 knots. - General&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was found in shallow marsh waters south of Timbalier Bay, about 15 miles south-southeast of HUM. The wreckage was recovered and transported to a salvage facility in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The recovered portions included the main fuselage, tailboom, the main rotor drive system, main rotor blades, engine, tail rotor blades and tail rotor gearbox, and landing gear with skid-mounted float assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDetailed examinations of the recovered components were conducted under the supervision of the NTSB investigator-in-charge. The FAA, Westwind Helicopters, Rolls Royce, and Bell Helicopter participated in the airframe examinations at Southern Aircraft Recovery on March 2-3, 2017. The Rolls-Royce engine was examined under the supervision of the FAA on March 3, 2017, at Arrow Aviation, Broussard, Louisiana. The Engine Control Unit (ECU) was transported to Triumph Engine Controls in West Hartford, Connecticut, for data extraction. The following are summaries of the examinations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe was destroyed by impact forces upon water contact, breaking into several pieces. Airframe deformations were consistent with a slightly nose low and left skid down orientation at the time of impact. The left forward Dzus fastener on the engine cowling that was reported loose at the ST37C platform was missing, and the cowling mounting hole was found fractured. The left side of the helicopter exhibited more damage than the right side, including doors, landing gear, and cockpit and nose area. The tailboom remained connected to the aft fuselage and the aft fuselage was separated from the aft engine firewall bulkhead. The tailboom was relatively intact with two slight bends to the left. The vertical fin exhibited a tail rotor strike to its bottom surface, consistent impact forces occurring after the tail rotor gearbox departed its mounting location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe skid-mounted float system was not deployed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotors&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll four main rotor blades exhibited spar and afterbody damage consistent with impact forces, but no spar fractures were observed. The top blade surface balance pocket weights located near the blade tips' leading edges were all intact, remaining firmly attached to the blade spars. The bottom blade surface balance pocket weights located near the blade tips' trailing edges had all departed from their mounting pockets in the blades afterbody surfaces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll four main rotor yoke arms were significantly damaged from impact forces, exhibiting delamination and fractures of the composite yoke flexure structure. All hub bearings were damaged consistent with overtravel. Up-stops and down-stops were significantly damaged, consistent with impact forces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth tail rotor blades remained connected to their respective yoke arms. Both blades were relatively intact with one blade exhibiting trailing edge blade tip skin delamination consistent with impact forces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo pre-impact anomalies were found in the main or tail rotor systems and the damages found were consistent with rotation at impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight Controls and Hydraulics&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit area was destroyed by impact forces. The helicopter was equipped with single controls at the pilot's station. The vertical tunnel where four vertical flight control tubes transit was found fractured consistent with impact at top and bottom surfaces. All four control tubes exhibited overload fractures at the top of the vertical tunnel and the right cyclic pitch control tube was found fractured in overload about 1 ft from the bottom of the tube. The cyclic was intact and remained connected to the control system. Cyclic movement revealed corresponding movement of the vertical control tubes. The collective was fractured at its cast base, consistent with impact forces. The collective jackshaft was intact but displaced due to extensive cockpit damage. Control linkages to the main rotor servos were found intact. All three main rotor servos and mounting support structures were intact, including intact nut and locking tabs at the spool valve wire drive to spool control lever connections.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTail rotor control system fractures were found at various locations due to airframe impact damage. The tail rotor pitch control was found intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic manifold was found intact and the hydraulic reservoir was full of hydraulic fluid. Both the pressure line to the manifold and the rotor brake hydraulic line were found fractured, consistent with overload forces. The bypass pop-out buttons for both the pressure and return lines were not extended. The hydraulic pump remained attached to the main transmission, but the elbow pressure fitting was found fractured consistent with impact forces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo pre-impact anomalies were found in the flight control or hydraulic systems.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDrive System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mast was intact and the chip detectors were clean. The main KaFlex driveshaft exhibited flexure fractures at both forward and aft locations consistent with overload at impact. The KaFlex outer diameter exhibited minimal rotational signatures. The transmission end KaFlex coupling could not be rotated by hand. The top case of the transmission was removed, revealing significant magnesium corrosion from the transmission case between the planetary and ring gear teeth, preventing rotation of transmission gearing. All observed gears were intact. Transmission mounting to the airframe was secure. The fore/aft pylon elastomeric restraints were both damaged. The left restraint was found fractured consistent with overload impact forces and the right restraint was bent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward steel short shaft under the engine remained connected to the engine end, but the aft spline coupling separated from the oil cooler shaft due to airframe impact deformations just forward of the oil cooler. The tail rotor driveshaft was found intact from the oil cooler to the most aft tail rotor driveshaft segment. Rotation of the driveshaft was inhibited due to crushing of the oil cooler fan shroud against the oil cooler fan. The last tail rotor driveshaft segment exhibited a fractured coupling attachment ear, consistent with overload impact forces on the tail rotor gearbox. Three of the four gearbox studs were found fractured. The right forward stud was found intact and a small piece of tail rotor gearbox casting material was found fractured, consistent with overload forces. The mounting spot faces on the gearbox support casting did not exhibit fretting, consistent with instantaneous fracture of the three studs. The tail rotor gearbox rotated by hand with moderate resistance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo pre-impact anomalies were found with the drive system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe fuel filter canister contained water and fuel with a heavy fuel smell, consistent with water immersion. The paper filter was relatively clean with water droplets in the paper element folds. The main fuel cell exhibited breaches consistent with airframe impact damage. Several fuel line breaks were observed, consistent with impact damage. The fuel valve was found in the closed position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter had been submerged in salt water for about 3 days before examination and was torn away from the airframe during the impact sequence. Both engine mounts had torn away at the airframe end and remained attached to the engine case. A section of airframe material remained attached to the engine by interface fuel and oil lines. Overall, the engine exhibited minimal impact damage with all modules and engine accessories in their normal respective positions. The fuel filter bypass button was found extended. Beginning corrosion was noted to the accessory gear box, consistent with salt water submersion. The exhaust stack remained attached to the engine and displayed minor impact damage. The stack was impacted with extending down and into the fourth stage turbine wheel area. The mud was removed from the stack. A small bag containing chip detector removal tools was found in the mud. Following a visual examination, the engine was given a fresh water rinse to remove the mud. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Disassembly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBefore disassembly, neither the N1 nor N2 drive trains could be rotated by hand. The compressor module was externally normal in appearance. One impeller blade leading edge exhibited foreign object debris impact damage, with a tear about ¼-inch inboard from the tip and deflection of the blade tip in the direction opposite rotation. Multiple impeller blades displayed deflection and slight bending of the blades in the direction opposite of rotation. The impeller shroud displayed areas of rotational scoring from contact with the impeller, with corresponding rub damage noted to the impeller blades near the knee area. The diffuser vanes were in position and undamaged. The scroll was undamaged. The bleed valve remained in position but displayed a fracture in the center port of the bypass line, consistent with impact forces near the port.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accessory gearbox displayed corrosion; however, no visible impact damage was noted. Separation of the gearbox case and cover revealed heavy internal corrosion of both the case and the cover.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "While performing a dark night, cross-country flight, the helicopter cruised towards its destination. The helicopter impacted a marshy area of a lake. Impact signatures were consistent with the helicopter colliding with trees and terrain in a nose low attitude. Weather information for the time of the accident showed that the helicopter was operating in an area favorable for instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions due to precipitation and mist, cloud ceilings between 1,000 to 1,600 ft above ground level, and possible moderate turbulence. Due to cloud cover, it is likely that the Moon was not visible. There is no evidence that the pilot obtained a weather briefing prior to takeoff. The pilot's log books were not recovered during the investigation and the pilot's total time, and night experience is not known. While the pilot held a rating for instrument airplane, it is not known how much training the pilot obtained, if any, for an instrument helicopter rating. It is likely that the pilot had no more than 30 hours in make and model.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nData downloaded from onboard avionics found that the flight was uneventful until 4 minutes before the accident when the helicopter made a right turn and began flying to the southwest. As the helicopter tracked southwest, the altitude dropped to about 600 ft msl (500 ft above ground level [agl]). A minute later, the helicopter turned left turn and descended in the turn to about 420 ft agl before it pitched up to 40° nose high, resulting in a 2,500 ft per minute (fpm) climb. The helicopter momentarily stabilized on a 55° heading. At this time, the pilot armed the airspeed hold mode but did not turned on the force trim, so the autopilot would not engage. It is likely that the pilot expected the autopilot to engage, and when the helicopter began a left bank, he turned on the force trim but did not re-engage the autopilot. Shortly thereafter, the helicopter exceeded a 45° left bank and the pitch exceeded 40° nose low. The helicopter rapidly descended and impacted terrain. An examination of the avionics data, airframe, and engine did not identify any preimpact anomalies. While several substances were found in the pilot's toxicology, their use did not appear to contribute to the accident. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot's inadvertent encounter with instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in in spatial disorientation, loss of control, and subsequent impact with terrain.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Spatial Disorientation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge, chapter 16, \"Aeromedical Factors,\" stated, \"Under normal flight conditions, when there is a visual reference to the horizon and ground, the sensory system in the inner ear helps to identify the pitch, roll, and yaw movements of the aircraft. When visual contact with the horizon is lost, the vestibular system becomes unreliable. Without visual references outside the aircraft, there are many situations in which normal motions and forces create convincing illusions that are difficult to overcome…Unless a pilot has many hours of training in instrument flight, flight should be avoided in reduced visibility or at night when the horizon is not visible. A pilot can reduce susceptibility to disorienting illusions through training and awareness and learning to rely totally on flight instruments.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of this report's creation, the FAA's Helicopter Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-21A, dated 2017, does not contain a section on spatial disorientation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInadvertent Entry into IMC&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Helicopter Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-21A, dated 2017, chapter 12, page 4, states, \"Deteriorating weather is even harder to detect at night…\". In addition, 5 basic steps \"that every pilot should be ultimately familiar with and should be executed immediately after inadvertently entering IMC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1. Attitude—level the wings on the attitude indicator, both pitch and bank.&#x0D;\n2. Heading—pick a heading that is known to be free of obstacles and maintain it. This may be 180° from your current heading.&#x0D;\n3. Power—adjust to a climb power setting.&#x0D;\n4. Airspeed—adjust to a climb airspeed.&#x0D;\n5. Trim—maintain coordinated flight so that an unusual attitude will not develop.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWorkload Management&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Helicopter Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-21A, dated 2017, chapter 14, \"Effective Aeronautical Decision-Making,\" states, \"Another important part of managing workload is recognizing a work overload situation. The first effect of high workload is that a pilot begins to work faster. As workload increases, attention cannot be devoted to several tasks at one time, and a pilot may begin to focus on one item. When a pilot becomes task saturated, there is no awareness of additional inputs from various sources, so decisions may be made on incomplete information, and the possibility of error increases. A very good example of this is inadvertent IMC. Once entering into bad weather, work overload becomes immediate. Mentally, the pilot must transition from flying outside of the aircraft to flying inside the aircraft. Losing all visual references can cause sensory overload and the ability to think rationally is gone. Instead of trusting the aircrafts instruments, pilots try to hang on to the little visual references that they have and forget all about the other factors surrounding them. Instead of slowing the helicopter down they increase airspeed. Because they are looking down for visual references they forget about the hazards in front of them and finally, because they are not looking at the flight instruments, the aircraft is not level. All of this can be avoided by proper training and proper planning. If going inadvertent IMC is your only course of action, pilots must commit to it and fly the helicopter using only the flight instruments and not trying to follow what little visual references they have.\" - The Bell 429 intermediate helicopter is an eight-seat twin engine, Category A, single pilot IFR certified rotorcraft. It is equipped with autopilot and force trim systems. The force trim system uses a spring force to hold the flight controls to a detent position. The detent position can be moved anywhere in the control range by either releasing the fight control from the spring mechanism and re-engaging it in a different position, or by driving it to a new position using a motorized actuator. The pilot can also fly the controls without releasing the force trim, but in this case the pilot must work against the spring force to make control inputs. Force trim is required for the autopilot to couple to the flight director.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nComplete maintenance logbooks were not recovered. Of the records located, a listing of scheduled maintenance inspections completed on October 31, 2016, reported the helicopter had accrued 12.1 total hours. The last annual inspection was performed on October 27, 2016, at a total time of 10.0 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot purchased the helicopter on July 1, 2016. The helicopter had accrued approximately 30 hours. - About 0017, an air traffic controller from KSHV contacted the pilot since the helicopter had entered Class C airspace. The controller informed the pilot of the Class C airspace and the pilot proceeded on course to F17. No radar services were provided, and no distress call was recorded. - On February 15, 2017, at 0023 central standard time, a Bell 429 helicopter, N598PB, impacted terrain and water at Wallace Lake near Shreveport, Louisiana. The private rated pilot and passenger were both fatally injured. The helicopter was substantially damaged. The helicopter was registered to and operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Dark night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed for the flight, which operated without a flight plan. The flight originated from a field in Bossier City, Louisiana, and was en route to Center Municipal Airport (F17), Center, Texas.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was in contact with air traffic control. When the helicopter disappeared from radar unexpectedly and did not respond to radio communications, it was the subject of an alert notice and was located on the afternoon of February 15. The wreckage was located at the southern end of Wallace Lake. - Due to the condition of the remains, the De Soto Parish Coroner's Office, Mansfield, Louisiana, was not able to perform an autopsy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology testing on samples from the pilot. Testing was negative for ethanol. Testing detected amphetamine, dihydrododeine, nordiazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAmphetamine is a Schedule II controlled substance available by prescription that stimulates the central&#x0D;\nnervous system available by prescription for the treatment of attention deficit disorder (ADD) and narcolepsy. Dihydrocodeine is an active metabolite of hydrocodone, a Schedule II opioid medication.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to records obtained from the pilot's primary care physician, he had a longstanding diagnosis of attention deficit disorder and had been treated with Vyvanse since before April 2015, (the first available visit record). He also had a history of joint pain for which he intermittently used hydrocodone. In 2015, he had an obstructing kidney stone and had been given a prescription for diazepam. His last visit was on January 24, 2017, for a review of his attention deficit disorder and mildly elevated blood pressure. No comment was made in the physician's record regarding any symptoms from the ADD or the effectiveness of the medication. - A weather study was conducted by a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Meteorologist. At 2356, an automated weather reporting station located at Shreveport Municipal Airport (KSHV), Shreveport, Louisiana, 10 nautical miles north of the accident site, reported wind from 320° at 11 knots, visibility 4 statute miles with light drizzle and mist, a broken ceiling at 700 ft, overcast at 1,300 ft, temperature 45° F, dew point 45° F, and a barometric pressure of 29.93 inches. There was a remark that drizzle began at 2251, and the ceiling varied between 500 ft and 900 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0049, the same station reported a wind from 320° at 9 knots, visibility 7 miles, a broken ceiling at 1,000 ft, overcast at 1,400 ft. There was a remark that drizzle ended at 0047.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of data from the closest National Weather Service Surveillance Radar-1988, Doppler, located at KSHV, found that near the accident site at the accident time, conditions were conducive for IMC and drizzle. There were no lightning strikes around the accident site at the accident time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo Airmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) were issued at 2045 CST on February 14, for forecasted instrument flight rules (IFR) conditions due to precipitation and mist, and possible moderate turbulence below 8,000 ft. Both AIRMETs were valid until 0900 on February 15.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe phase of the Moon was waning gibbous with 78% of the Moon's visible disk illuminated. With the extensive cloud cover above the accident site at the accident time, the Moon would not have been visible.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA search of official weather briefings sources did not locate a pilot's request for weather prior to the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe complete weather study report is located in the docket of this report. - The pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for helicopter, airplane single-engine land, multi-engine land, and instrument airplane. His log books were not recovered during the investigation and the pilot's total time, and night experience is not known. While the pilot held a rating for instrument airplane, it is not known how much training the pilot obtained, if any, for an instrument helicopter rating.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 26, 2015, the pilot was issued a third-class medical certificate with the limitation that he \"must wear correct lenses for near and distant vision.\" He reported no medication use.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot attended the Bell Training Academy at the end of October 2016. During his training, he logged 9.2 hours of flight instruction of the Bell 429 to include operation of the auto pilot. In addition, he logged 5.2 hours of flight instruction in a flight training device which included Auto Pilot Operation, use of the on-board flight planning devices, and inadvertent flight into IMC. All maneuvers performed were evaluated to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Practical Test Standards Test tolerances. - Damage to several trees and a large crater were consistent with the helicopter's impact with terrain. The debris field fanned out about 20° either side of a 320° magnetic heading for about 80 yards in a marshy area of Wallace Lake. There was evidence of a post-impact fire in the debris field. The helicopter was fragmented in multiple location and scattered throughout the debris field. The main wreckage consisted of the fuselage and main rotor hub which came to rest near the end of the debris field.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was removed from the marsh and transported to the shore for documentation and examination. The examination did not reveal any preimpact anomalies with the helicopter. The helicopter's display unit (DU) retains non-volatile memory and was sent to Bell Helicopter, Fort Worth, Texas, for download.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDisplay Unit Download&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUnder the auspices of the NTSB and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the DU was downloaded and the information plotted. A review of the information revealed that the helicopter lifted off and departed a field near the Horseshoe Casino, Bossier City, Louisiana, at 0015. The helicopter departed to the southwest and then flew near the Red River, as it headed to the southeast, and maintained an altitude between 800 to 1,000 ft mean sea level (msl). At 0019, the helicopter made a right turn and flew to the southwest. As the helicopter tracked southwest on a 230° heading, the altitude dropped to about 600 ft msl or 500 ft above ground level (agl). At 0022, the helicopter turned 30° bank left turn. The helicopter descended in the turn to about 420 ft agl, before it pitched up to 40° nose high, resulting in 2,500 ft per minute (fpm) climb to 1,470 msl (1,386 agl). The helicopter momentarily stabilized on a 055° heading. At 0023:00 then exceeded a 45° left bank and the pitch exceeded 40° nose low. The time of the last capture was 0023:13, with the helicopter traveling 167 knots and descending more than 8,800 fpm. Control inputs were performed by the pilot up to and including the last capture.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the flight, no problems with airframe or engine control inputs were detected. Data captured revealed that the pilot flew a majority of the accident with the Force Trim off. He also did not select any flight director modes. At 0022:46 (27 seconds prior to impact), the pilot armed the airspeed hold mode. The pilot's action would have presented him flight director commands, but due to the Force Trim being off, the autopilot could not engage to hold this mode. At 0022:56 (18 seconds prior to impact), the pilot turned on the Force Trim. However, the pilot did not reselect an attitude mode for the autopilot to engage to a mode. The manufacturer recommends turning on Force Trim shortly after takeoff. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The non-scheduled passenger helicopter flight departed from an oil tanker ship that was anchored in a bay. The pilot reported that the departure had been delayed, but, when the helicopter did depart, the weather was \"good.\" He said he had more than 6 miles visibility, that and he could see the moon above and the water below, and that his en route altitude was between 700 and 800 feet. He added that as the flight approached the shore at 500 feet, he could see the city lights and lights off the water. The next thing he remembered was being in the water. He and the two passengers were subsequently found by the US Coast Guard about 1hour later. The nearest weather observation station, located 8 miles east of the accident site, reported an overcast ceiling of 400 feet and 5 miles visibility in mist about 17 minutes before the accident. TAFs and AIRMETs issued about 1.5 hours and 1 hour before the accident, respectively, forecast instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Postaccident examination of the helicopter wreckage was consistent with a relatively level impact, and no pre-impact mechanical anomalies were noted that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely that the flight encountered IMC at night and that the pilot did not properly gauge the distance of the helicopter from the water, which led to its collision with the water.",
    "FactualNarrative": "N978RH, serial number 4075, a model 206B-III, was manufactured by the Bell Helicopter Corporation in 1989. It was powered by an Allison (now Rolls-Royce) 250-C20J turboshaft engine, serial number CAE 270491, rated at 450 shaft horsepower.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe last airframe annual inspection was performed on August 31, 2016, at 15,138.9 total hours. At the time of the accident, the airframe had accrued 15,287.2 total hours. The transponder and pitot-static system were IFR-certified on September 30, 2016 (FAR 91.413 and 91.411). At the last 100-hour inspection, the engine had accumulated 13,645.4 total hours and 24,394 cycles. The last compressor and turbine overhauls were accomplished at 11,872.8 and 13,118.3 hours, respectively. - On February 6, 2017, at 1906 central standard time, a Bell 206B-III, N978RH, impacted the waters of West Bay near Galveston, Texas. One passenger was fatally injured. The pilot and a second passenger were seriously injured. The helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Republic Helicopters, Santa Fe, Texas, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 as a non-scheduled domestic passenger flight. Instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the time of the accident. Company flight following was being utilized. The flight originated from the oil tanker Eagle Vancouver, anchored in Galveston Bay, at 1837, and was en route to Republic's Helicopters, Inc., Heliport (2TE1), Santa Fe, Texas.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, this was the helicopter's third flight of the day. It departed 2TE1 at 1404 and flew to the Eagle Vancouver, landing at 1457. The pilot shut down and the two passengers, both employees of Societe Generalde Surveillance (SGS), disembarked and began their work on the tanker. The helicopter had originally been scheduled to depart at 1600 but was delayed. The helicopter finally took off at 1837. Official sunset was at 1802. It was scheduled to arrive at 2TE1 at 1910. The last radio communication Republic Helicopters Operations had with the helicopter was at 1906 when the pilot reported, \"I have the lights of the shore.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a GPS SkyRouter fast tracking system that reports the helicopter's position every 2 minutes. The last data point received from the GPS SkyRouter system was at 1906, when the helicopter was about 0.27miles from the Galveston Island coastline at 494 feet and 127 mph. Republic Helicopters An \"Inactive\" signal was received from the Blue Sky GPS by Republic Helicopters Operations 10 minutes after this last contact, or 1916, and the U.S. Coast Guard was alerted. Based on time and distance from the last data point to the accident location with an approximate helicopter speed of 120 mph, the time of the accident was computed to be 1909.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 22, 2017, at 1100, two Federal Aviation Administration inspectors from the Houston Flight Standards District Office interviewed the pilot at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Also present was Republic's Director of Safety and the pilot's wife. The pilot confirmed there had been a delay in departure, but when they did depart, the weather was \"good.\" He said he had more than 6 miles' visibility and he could see the moon above and the water below.  He contacted Republic Operations, established his flight plan, received a weather update and got the current altimeter setting. His en route altitude was between 700 and 800 feet. He said that as he approached Galveston Island State Park, he had visual reference with the lights from Galveston and lights off the water. The next thing he remembered was being in the water.&#x0D;\nhe didn't. They had to throw the line again. When they got me to the deck, I just flopped down on the deck. I was so cold. I just don't understand why it took so long for someone to rescue us.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was at N29°14.39' W94°59.44' -- 4.3 miles from the last Blue Sky data point at an azimuth of 326.95° and 8 miles, or 283° from Scholes International Airport (KGLS), Galveston. It was 6.96 miles on a heading of 325.73° from 2TE1. The accident site was in an area with little or no ground lights. - The pilot and right rear seat passenger were both seriously injured and were found by the U.S. Coast Guard approximately one hour after the accident, clinging to a section of fuselage.  The pilot had sustained stomach and intestinal trauma, several lumbar fractures, and abrasions on his shoulders, consistent with rubbing of the shoulder harness. The left front seat passenger was fatally injured and was found about 100 meters from the wreckage. - According to Meteorology Group Chairman's Factual Report, AIRMET (Airmen's Meteorological Information) Sierra was issued at 1445 CST, well before the accident flight departure time, and valid at the accident time for the accident site. The AIRMET forecast IFR conditions due to mist developing between 1500 and 1800 CST. The Area Forecast (FA) issued at 1345 CST and valid at the accident time and departure time forecasted a broken ceiling at 2,000 feet with tops at 5,000 feet. The KGLS Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF), valid at the time of the accident, was issued at 1906 CST and was valid for a 23-hour period beginning at 1900 CST. It forecasted the wind to be from 150° at 10 knots, 5 statute miles visibility, mist, and an overcast ceiling at 400 feet agl. The KGLS TAF valid before the departure time was issued at 1726 CST and was valid for a 24-hour period beginning at 1800 CST. It forecasted the wind to be from 150° at 14 knots, 6 statute miles visibility, haze, and scattered clouds at 1,000 feet agl. The 1726 CST KGLS TAF forecast did not forecast L (low) IFR conditions until 2000 CST.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe report noted the phase of the moon was \"Waxing Gibbous with 78% of the Moon's visible disk illuminated. The moonlight would have likely been visible above the cloud tops. Below 3,000 feet near the accident site at the accident time would have been instrument meteorological conditions with no moonlight visible.\" - The 30-year-old pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating, and private pilot privileges with airplane single-engine land and instrument ratings. He was hired by Republic Helicopters on March 31, 2015. His first-class airman medical certificate, dated March 16, 2016, contained no waivers, limitations, or restrictions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Republic Helicopters records, as of September 7, 2016, the pilot had logged a total of 1,702 flight hours, of which 1,552 hours were in rotorcraft, 1,452 hours were in the Bell 206, and another 600 hours in Bell models 222, 230, and 430. He had also logged 220 hours were under simulated instrument conditions, and 4 hours were in actual instrument conditions. He had also logged 150 hours in single-engine airplanes. No night flying time was noted in any category. His last FAA and company proficiency check was accomplished on March 1, 2016, in the Bell 206. - The helicopter was recovered from West Bay on February 8, 2017, by T&amp;T Marine Salvage, Inc, and was examined at their facilities at Teichman Point, Galveston, on February 8 and 9, 2017. T&amp;T Marine Salvage reported the water depth at the accident site was approximately 7 to 8 feet, and all recovered wreckage was found in a radius of 80 to 100 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDamage was consistent with a relatively level water impact. The fuselage was separated into several sections. The cabin and cockpit area was extensively damaged. The main rotor had departed the helicopter. There was evidence of mast bumping. The mast fracture was consistent with the rotating main rotor blades striking the water. Three main rotor blades strikes to the fuselage were noted. Both main rotor blades bore impact damage, with one blade missing two-thirds of its span to the tip.  The other main rotor blades had an intact spar, but the spar was bent forward -- consistent with sudden stoppage. Transmission continuity was observed. The last two tail rotor driveshaft segments on the tail boom were missing and evidence indicated that the driveshaft was struck by a main rotor blade at impact. The tail rotor gearbox rotated freely.  The helicopter was equipped with STC (supplemental type certificate) Van Horn tail rotor blades. They turned freely , and the hub and blades were relatively intact. Free T/R pitch change was present through the T/R hub.  The flight controls exhibited much damage in the cockpit and vertical tunnel areas. No pre-impact anomalies were observed in any airframe systems.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the instrument panel revealed the following: altimeter, 900 feet; Kollsman window, 29.92 inches of mercury; heading indicator, 220°; Hobbs meter, 4,143.8. Examination of the annunciator panel revealed no stretching of any of the bulb filaments. Examination of the position lights revealed no filament stretching of the red or white lights. The green light and landing lights were destroyed. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The purpose of the flight was to take nighttime aerial photographs of several cruise ships in a nearby harbor. The helicopter with the commercial pilot and the passenger/photographer aboard departed from the operator's ramp area, and proceeded to the harbor where it made numerous orbits. Following the orbits, the helicopter flew toward a jetty, and witnesses on one ship reported that the helicopter started spinning as it went straight down into the water. The helicopter came to rest upright in about 18 ft of water. All major components of the helicopter were recovered except the outboard 3/4 of one main rotor blade. The fracture surface at the separation point was jagged and angular consistent with an overstress failure at impact. The intact main rotor blade exhibited coning, which was indicative of low rotor rpm at impact. There were no rotational signatures between the cooling fan and scroll or the upper sheave and the airframe, which indicated that the engine was not operating at impact. Examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor heat control knob in the cockpit was in the full down or \"OFF\" position and unlocked. The slider on the carburetor heat airbox was in a midrange position; the airbox was deformed, and the slider cable was displaced. At impact, if the airbox moves out of position, it will likely stretch the cable, which will move the slider valve. The helicopter was equipped with a carburetor heat assist device; lowering the collective mechanically added heat and raising the collective reduced heat. If the pilot was not manipulating the collective, the assist device would not have an effect. Carburetor heat would only be controlled by the pilot's manipulation of the carburetor heat control knob. If the control knob had been up in an \"ON\" position, it likely would have been bent and still up.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe manufacturer has issued safety notices regarding carburetor ice and low rotor rpm blade stall. One safety notice stated that failure to maintain rotor rpm can result in low rotor rpm stall, and the helicopter can fall at an extreme rate. Another safety notice stated that main rotor blade stall due to low main rotor rpm caused a very high percentage of helicopter accidents. If the pilot had maintained main rotor rpm, he might have been able to make a successful autorotation and touch down less violently on the water, which might have allowed the occupants to egress the helicopter. However, performing an autorotation to water on a dark night would be a difficult maneuver.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe meteorological conditions at the time of the accident were conducive for the formation of carburetor ice, but the carburetor heat control knob was in the \"OFF\" position. It is likely that the pilot's failure to apply carburetor heat resulted in a loss of engine power due to carburetor ice. During the ensuing forced landing, the pilot did not maintain adequate main rotor rpm, and the helicopter descended rapidly to impact.",
    "FactualNarrative": "RHC Safety Notice (SN) SN-10 stresses the importance of instantly adding throttle and lowering the collective to maintain main rotor rpm in an emergency. It states that failure to do so can result in low rotor rpm stall, and the helicopter can fall at an extreme rate. It notes that failure to maintain main rotor rpm is a leading cause of fatal accidents in light helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSN-18 states that flying a helicopter in obscured visibility or even on a dark night can be fatal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSN-19 notes that flying over water is very hazardous. It recommends that a pilot maintain 500 ft above ground level (agl) whenever possible, and avoid maneuvers over water below 200 ft agl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSN-24 emphasizes that rotor stall due to low rpm causes a very high percentage of helicopter accidents, both fatal and non-fatal. It states that when rotor stall occurs above 40 to 50 ft, it will most likely be fatal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSN-25 discusses carburetor ice. It stated that carburetor ice could cause engine stoppage, and was most likely to occur when there was high humidity or visible moisture, and the air temperature was below 70° F. It stated that even in generally dry air, local conditions such as a nearby body of water could be conducive to carburetor ice. It stated that during descent or autorotation, the pilot should ignore the carburetor air temperature gauge, and apply full carburetor heat. RHC published a revision to SN-25 in July 2012 stating that carburetor heat may be required on takeoff, and the carburetor heat control knob should be left unlatched unless it was obvious that conditions were not conducive to carburetor ice. It also noted that carburetor ice could form at outside air temperatures as high as 30° C (86° F).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSN-29 states that there have been a number of fatal accidents involving experienced pilots with many hours in airplanes, but limited experience flying helicopters. The ingrained reactions to an emergency could have fatal results. All of the pilot's helicopter time was attained in the current year and was just over 10% of his total time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSN-31 notes that the governor can mask carburetor ice. With the throttle governor on, carburetor ice will not become apparent as a loss of either rpm or manifold pressure. The governor will automatically adjust throttle to maintain a constant rpm, which will also result in a constant manifold pressure. It states that when in doubt, the pilot should apply carburetor heat as required to keep the carburetor air temperature out of the yellow arc during hover, climb, or cruise, and apply full carburetor heat when the manifold pressure is below 18 inches.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSafety Notice 34 emphasizes that aerial survey and photography flights are high risk.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe R22 Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH) stated that a carburetor heat assist device was installed on the helicopter. The device correlated application of carburetor heat with changes in the collective setting. Lowering the collective mechanically added heat and raising collective reduced heat. The system included a latch at the control knob to lock the carburetor heat off when not required. The system contained a friction clutch that allowed the pilot to override the system. It instructed the pilot to readjust carburetor heat as necessary following any change in power. The POH included \"set as required\" for the carburetor heat line of the starting engines and run-up checklist, and \"adjust carb heat as required\" to the takeoff procedure in the normal procedures section of the POH. - Fueling records established that the helicopter was last fueled on January 3, 2017, with the addition of 11.9 gallons of 100-octane aviation fuel. The owner flew the helicopter just before the accident flight, and said that 15 gallons of fuel remained at the conclusion of that flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators drained the fuel tanks. Clear fluid was in the bottom of the buckets with blue fluid on top, and investigators estimated that the 5 gallons of blue fluid looked and smelled like 100-octane aviation fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot and passenger recorded their weights before takeoff. Based on these weights, the operator determined that the helicopter was within both longitudinal and lateral weight and balance limitations at takeoff and at the time of the accident. RHC computations concurred with this determination. Using weights provided by the coroner, RHC determined that the helicopter was slightly out of longitudinal limits at takeoff and at the time of the accident. - On January 4, 2017, about 1736 Pacific standard time, a Robinson Helicopter Company (RHC) R22, N702JJ, collided with the water near San Pedro, California. The commercial pilot and the passenger sustained fatal injuries; the helicopter sustained substantial damage. JJ Helicopters was operating the helicopter under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The local photography flight departed Torrance Municipal Airport, Torrance, California, about 1635. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan had been filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that the purpose of the flight was to take aerial photos of several cruise ships in a nearby harbor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecorded radar data showed that the helicopter departed from Torrance Municipal Airport and proceeded toward the Los Angeles harbor area. The helicopter made numerous circles, and the last portion of the track showed the helicopter on a southeasterly course crossing perpendicular to a jetty that terminated at a lighthouse marking the west side of the harbor mouth. When the helicopter was southwest of the lighthouse, it made a sweeping left 270° turn that went past the lighthouse and then began a slightly curved course parallel to the ocean side of the jetty. The last few targets indicate a sharp turn to the right and terminated on the inland side of the jetty. The data points for the last 11 minutes recorded mode C altitudes that varied between 100 ft and 700 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNumerous witnesses on a cruise ship that was exiting the harbor mouth at the time of the accident reported that the helicopter started spinning as it descended straight down into the water. One witness commented that it was \"just dark enough to make it difficult to see the helicopter, all you could see clearly were the [spinning] lights.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral local agencies initiated a search, and the wreckage was located about 1015 on January 5, 2017. The wreckage was on the inland side of the jetty, and southwest of the lighthouse at the end of the jetty. - The Los Angeles County Coroner, Los Angeles, California, completed an autopsy on the pilot and determined that the cause of death was drowning.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing of specimens from the pilot by the FAA's Bioaeronautical Science's Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, were negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol and tested drugs. - FAA Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin CE-09-35 contains a graph that illustrates the probability of carburetor icing for various temperature and relative humidity conditions. The conditions encountered in this accident (ambient temperature 55° F / dew point 52° F, 88% relative humidity), were in the area of serious icing at cruise power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe passenger's camera was examined by the National Transportation Safety Board's Recorders Division. Most of the photographs were of Los Angeles harbor and several cruise ships in the area. The last photograph was an aerial shot of a cruise ship leaving the harbor area and depicted dark light conditions. The helicopter's location was outside of the breakwater and lighthouse at the entrance to the harbor. - The pilot had 90 hours total time in rotorcraft, and 45 as pilot-in-command in the accident make/model. His initial training was in fixed wing airplanes, and all helicopter flight time had occurred during the current year. - The local agencies that recovered the helicopter reported that the helicopter came to rest upright in about 18 ft of water. The first responder dive team noted that the pilot was in the right seat, and the passenger was in the left seat; both victims still had their seat belts fastened. The pilot was wearing a helmet and an inflated life vest. All major components of the helicopter were recovered except the outboard 3/4 of one main rotor blade. The fracture surface at the separation point was jagged and angular. Multiple searches did not locate the missing portion of the main rotor blade.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe throttle, mixture, and carburetor heat controls were connected at both ends; the airframe structure was collapsed around the controls, and they would not move. The throttle arm at the carburetor was about 3/4 open. The mixture was in the full rich position. The carburetor heat control knob in the cockpit was in the full down or \"OFF\" position and unlocked. The slider on the carburetor heat airbox was in a midrange position; the airbox was deformed, and the slider cable was displaced.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no holes in the crankcase or cylinders that indicated a catastrophic failure of the engine. The tail pipe coloration was light gray with no oil residue. There were no rotational signatures between the cooling fan and scroll or the upper sheave and the airframe.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators left the engine in place, and removed the valve covers. They manually rotated the crankshaft by turning the fan wheel. The crankshaft rotated freely, and the valves moved about the same amount of lift in firing order. The gears in the accessory case turned freely. Investigators obtained thumb compression on all cylinders in firing order.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA borescope inspection revealed no mechanical deformation on the valves, cylinder walls, or internal cylinder head.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth main rotor blades were bent down at the hub, and then bent upward about 2 ft out from the hub. One blade separated at that point along a jagged angle. The other main rotor blade coned upward at that point; it retained its full length but had a tear at midspan from the trailing edge to the back of the spar. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The airline transport pilot and passenger departed on an expected 30-minute visual flight rules flight that was destined for the pilot's private helipad and residence on the southeast side of a neighboring Hawaiian island. Before the flight, the pilot's mechanic asked the pilot not to fly due to the weather at the intended destination, but the pilot insisted on flying. The National Weather Service forecast products that were available before the flight indicated a trade wind pattern that would bring bands of rain, low visibility, and mountain obscurations to the eastern slopes of the islands, but it is unknown if the pilot reviewed these products or any other forecast of expected weather conditions along the flight route. One witness stated that the pilot routinely flew at night to his helipad and that she had previously seen the pilot's helicopter operating in dark adverse weather conditions. Several witnesses reported seeing the helicopter fly over their locations in dark conditions with wind and rain. Two witnesses reported that they saw the helicopter make an approach to a ridgeline near the pilot's helipad, but then the helicopter disappeared from view because of a cloud or terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMeteorological data revealed that a line of rain showers moved over the accident site at the accident time. The reduced visibility and ceiling as the line of rain showers moved east to west over the rising mountain terrain likely resulted in instrument meteorological conditions and mountain obscuration conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n The helicopter wreckage was discovered 0.75 mile upslope of the intended destination. Tree and ground impact marks indicated a relatively level descent to the ground at an approach angle of about 18° on a 310° heading, which is indicative of impact with terrain in controlled forward flight. The helicopter was destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions of the engine, drive train, main rotor, tail rotor, or structure of the helicopter. Damage to the mast support structure, main rotor hub, main rotor blades and upper flight controls is consistent with power-on main rotor blade impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGiven the weather conditions and witness observations, the pilot encountered dark instrument meteorological conditions and rain while flying in an area of rising terrain as he likely searched for the helipad at his residence, which was outfitted with various lights that would have been difficult to see in reduced visibility. The pilot did not have the visual cues necessary to maintain clearance above the ground, resulting in geographic disorientation, which subsequently led to controlled flight into terrain.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Helipad&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe private helipad was located upslope of the pilot's residence at an elevation of about 750 ft on a ridgeline that runs along a 330° magnetic heading up the southeast face of Kamakou Mountain. The helipad had four red A650 automatic solar-powered perimeter lights on 14 inch mounting pads, and four red vertical exterior lights were attached to an 18 foot ladder on the south side of the hangar facility that faced to the southeast. The vertical lights were a rudimentary approach lighting design with compact fluorescent lamp (CLF) and light emitting diode (LED) bulbs. The lights were controlled by a mechanical pin timer that exhibited extended pins from time 2000 to 0600. The face of the timer had no current time dial, so set time could not be correlated to actual time. The property caretaker reported that the pilot routinely used the vertical red lights to find the helipad during dark night conditions and that the lights should have been on the night of the accident. It is unknown if the vertical lights were illuminated at the time the pilot was searching for the helipad. Red lights were also installed on the perimeter of the roof of the pilot's residence, which was located near the coastline at an elevation of about 200 ft, to assist with navigation up the ridgeline to the helipad. Witness No. 3, who resided on the adjacent ridgeline, stated that electrical power was not interrupted on the night of the accident and that the perimeter lights on the pilot's home were on. - The helicopter, serial number 100634D, was manufactured in 1979 as a Hughes 369D helicopter. The type certificate at the time of the accident was held by MD Helicopters, Inc. (MDHI) The helicopter was powered by a Rolls-Royce (Allison) 250-C20B turboshaft engine. The helicopter was controlled by a single pilot from the left seat.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's maintenance records revealed that its last annual inspection occurred on September 17, 2016. According to a maintenance tracking report dated November 17, 2016, the airframe total time was 9,640.1 hours, and the engine total time was 8,371.1 hours. An emergency locator transmitter was not installed or required to be installed. - On November 15, 2016, about 1841 Hawaii standard time, a turbine-powered Hughes (MDHI) 369D helicopter, N81GG, impacted mountainous tree-covered terrain about 1 mile north of Pukoo, Hawaii. The airline transport pilot and the passenger were fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire. The helicopter was registered to the pilot who was operating it under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. No flight plan was filed for the visual flight rules (VFR) personal flight. Night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at the accident site at the time of the accident. The flight departed from Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Honolulu, Hawaii, at 1756 and was destined for a private residence near Pukoo, located on the island of Molokai.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's mechanic, who helped load and fuel the helicopter, the purpose of the flight was to transport the pilot's friend from HNL to Molokai. The pilot lived and worked in Honolulu and had another residence on the east side of Molokai that included a private helipad. The residence was located on the southeast side of Kamakou Mountain. The flight distance was about 65 nautical miles (nm), and the expected flight time was 30 minutes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanic reported that he advised the pilot not to fly given the weather conditions, but that the pilot insisted on flying because he had to tend to business. About 1730, the mechanic sent a text message to the property caretaker of the pilot's home on Molokai to check the weather. According to statements provided to the Maui County Police Department, the caretaker replied, \"mountain is a little wet and the clouds are low out East near the house,\" but the pilot had already departed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nArchived FAA voice communications from Molokai air traffic control tower, (MKK), Kualapuu, Hawaii, indicated that the pilot reported \"2 miles southwest of the mudflats 1 mile off shore at 700 feet transition to the east,\" at 1823. The control tower approved the transition through class D airspace and provided an altimeter setting of 3003. The pilot repeated the altimeter setting. This last reported position was about 20 miles from the destination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanic reported that he called the pilot after the helicopter's expected arrival time on November 15 but was unable to reach him. Early on November 16, the mechanic asked the caretaker to check for the pilot at his residence, but the caretaker did not find the pilot or his helicopter. The US Coast Guard and Maui County Police Department were notified, and a coordinated land and sea search was conducted. At 0852, the FAA issued an alert notice for the helicopter. According to Maui County Police Department records, the crew of a Maui fire and rescue helicopter discovered the wreckage about 1331 in Pukoo, about 0.75 mile north of the pilot's helipad.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Maui County Police Department interviewed six ground witnesses who observed the helicopter flying overhead in the Pukoo vicinity on the night of the accident. The witnesses stated that the weather conditions were dark with rain and wind and that the helicopter had its searchlight on. One of the witnesses (witness # 1 in figure 1), who lived 1.2 miles southwest of the helipad, stated that he saw the helicopter fly from the coastline to the mountain ridge and perform an approach toward the pilot's helipad, but this witness then lost sight of the helicopter when it entered a cloud.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Location of accident site, helipad and witnesses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) interviewed four ground witnesses. One of the witnesses, (witness #2 in figure 1) who lived with another witness about 1 mile southwest of the helipad and 2 miles from the accident site, observed the helicopter flying \"surprisingly low\" and slow over their property with its searchlight on. The witness recognized the accident pilot's helicopter because she was accustomed to seeing that helicopter fly over her property. She stated that the pilot had flown in \"horrific conditions\" before and reported that, when she observed the helicopter, it was \"very dark\" and \"very windy\" with clouds and rain higher up on the mountain. The witness photographed the helicopter with her iPhone. The time stamp on the iPhone photograph was 1836, and it revealed that the helicopter was flying in dark night conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness who lived 0.2 mile east of the pilot's property (witness #3 in figure 1) stated that the weather on the night of the accident was \"very windy and rainy\" and \"as bad as I've ever seen.\" The witness observed the helicopter perform a controlled approach to the ridgeline above her house, and not the ridgeline to the west where the pilot's helipad was located, and then the helicopter descended behind terrain and disappeared from view. She stated that the rain appeared to fall at a 45 to 90° angle to the ground in the illumination of the helicopter's searchlight. She observed a bright orange illumination in the clouds sometime after that. - Pan Pacific Pathologists, Wailuku, Hawaii, performed an autopsy of the pilot. The autopsy report stated that the pilot's cause of death was undetermined with probable multiple blunt force injuries. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed forensic toxicology on specimens from the pilot with negative results for ethanol and drugs. Carbon monoxide and cyanide testing were not performed. - The National Weather Service (NWS) area forecast for Hawaii, issued at 1734 and valid at the time of the accident, indicated the following conditions for Oahu and Molokai: scattered clouds at 2,500 ft, scattered to broken ceiling at 5,000 ft; temporary conditions of broken ceilings at 2,500 ft and visibility between 3 and 5 miles with rain showers; and isolated conditions of broken ceilings at 1,500 feet with visibility below 3 miles in rain showers. The NWS area forecast discussion (AFD) at 1604 (the closest AFD to the accident time) indicated that an area of showery low clouds was moving toward the islands in the trade wind flow (west) and was expected to continue to promote the development of marginal VFR conditions (visibilities and ceilings) over windward (east) portions of the Big Island…and appear poised to move ashore over windward portions of the smaller islands (Molokai) overnight. AIRMET Sierra was issued at 1731, before the flight departed, and was valid at the accident time and for the area near the accident site. AIRMET Sierra advised of mountain obscuration on the north- through east-facing slopes of Molokai due to clouds and rain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest official weather station to the accident site was an automated surface observing system (ASOS) at MKK, which was about 17 miles west of the accident site. The ASOS recorded the following conditions at 1854 (13 minutes after the accident): wind from 030° at 15 knots with gusts to 21 knots, visibility 10 miles, a broken ceiling at 4,800 ft, a broken cloud layer at 5,500 ft, temperature 24°C, dew point 21°C, and altimeter 30.04 inches of mercury. The surface observations surrounding the accident time indicated VFR conditions on the leeward side of mountainous terrain with periods of rain and gusty wind from the east to the northeast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of archived radar data from the Molokai NWS Weather Surveillance Radar-1988, Doppler (WSR-88D,) which was located 17 miles west of the accident site, showed that, between 1834 and 1845, a line of rain showers moved from east to west over the accident site, likely with reduced visibilities and ceilings. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. WSR-88D Doppler Radar at 1840.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA search of official weather briefing sources, such as Lockheed Martin Flight Service and Direct User Access Terminal Service, indicated that the accident pilot did not request an official weather briefing. The pilot's mechanic stated that the pilot normally checked the Molokai radar images on the NWS website before his flights to Pukoo.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording the US Naval Observatory astronomical data, sunset at the accident site on the day of the accident was at 1746, and the end of civil twilight was at 1809. The moon was not visible during the accident flight; moonrise occurred at 1925.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor further weather information, see the weather study in the public docket for this accident. - The pilot, age 70, held an airline transport pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating issued on December 29, 2009. Additionally, he held a commercial pilot certificate with airplane multiengine land and instrument airplane ratings and a private pilot certificate with an airplane single-engine land and sea rating. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on May 17, 2016, with the limitation to have available glasses for near vision. According to a family member, the pilot was in excellent health. On his most recent medical certificate application, the pilot reported 4,210.7 hours of total flight experience, 45.2 hours of which were within the last 6 months.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's logbook was not located, so his instrument and night flight experience and the number of hours in the accident helicopter make and model could not be determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's workplace personal assistant, the pilot flew to Molokai about every other week, often after work at night. A family member recalled that, during one flight, the pilot diverted to MKK due to deteriorating weather conditions near Pukoo. The family member also stated that the pilot used GPS to navigate at night. - The pilot's cyclic grip was one of the few flight control sections that survived the postcrash fire. The cyclic grip was examined for any signs of missing or damaged parts, contamination or any other anomalies. The NTSB documented the cyclic grip using x-ray radiograph and computed tomography (CT) scanning, which was conducted at Varex Imaging, Chicago, Illinois. The CT scans revealed multiple cracks, displaced trigger switch interior mechanisms, splayed core electrical wire strands, a nose-down trim wire that appeared closer to the trim switch ground contact solder than the thickness of the wire insulation, where the solder composing the junction of the nose-down trim wire and its corresponding trim switch contact appeared to be distorted. The splayed core wire strands, the wire-solder proximity, and the distorted nose down trim wire contact solder joint appeared to be consistent with a tension load applied to the wires during the impact sequence. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the CT scans were completed, the NTSB's Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC. disassembled the cyclic grip to determine the component's integrity and electrical continuity. The four-position trim switch was removed from the cyclic grip and examined using a stereo microscope. Four of the five soldered connections between the signal wires and switch contacts exhibited varying levels of disbonding, and the fifth connection (for nose-down trim) was completely disbonded and remained attached due to mechanical interference. These results were consistent with wires separating under tension during the impact sequence. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor more information about these findings, see the CT Specialist's and the Materials Laboratory factual reports in the public docket for this accident. - The accident site was located on the southeast side of Kamakou Mountain, which has a peak of 4,970 ft, in a remote area on a 25° southeast slope of a rising ridge at 1,389 ft. The wreckage came to rest about 0.75 mile north of the helipad at the pilot's residence. An aerial view of the wreckage site indicated a confined wreckage field, about 80 ft long and 25 ft wide, of burned and fragmented components on a heading of about 310° and a ground brush fire pattern that continued northwest for 50 ft upslope. Postimpact fire damage was observed throughout the wreckage field. All major components were found. Tree strike marks and broken tree limbs were observed on the south end of the wreckage field, starting at tree tops located about 100 ft from the initial ground impact. The tree strikes indicated a descent angle of about 18° from the tree tops to the landing skids, which made the first ground impact. The transmission, main rotor head, rotor blades, engine, and tail rotor drive shaft were spread upslope through the burned area and showed thermal and impact damage. The tail rotor section was found intact near the southwest portion of the site. No thermal damage was observed, but the tail rotor section was completely fractured forward of the tail rotor gear box.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing skid tubes had separated from the airframe and were located at the southern end of the wreckage field among broken canopy windscreen pieces. The left skid was imbedded almost 30 inches into the dirt, consistent with forward flight and the initial impact point. The fuselage and cockpit sustained extensive thermal damage with only the engine firewall intact. The cabin and cockpit were completely consumed by the postimpact fire, but a few instruments were recovered at the scene. The altimeter indicated 913 ft with a setting of 30.00 inches of mercury. The dual tachometer gauge was found on the ground with an NR (rotor speed) reading of 340 rpm and an N2 power turbine speed reading of 78 percent. The pilot's cyclic grip was fractured and separated from the control stick about 1 inch below the grip, with wires from the switches extending outward from the fracture. The GPS unit was not located. The pilot's watch was recovered at the scene; the pointers had stopped when the time was 1841. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe support structure with the mast, main transmission, upper controls, main rotor hub, and five main rotor blades separated from the main fuselage near the upper fuselage attach areas. Two of the five main rotor blades remained attached to the main rotor hub; the others had separated at the steel strap sets and were found near the rotor head. Each main rotor blade showed signs of impact damage, bending, span-wise splitting along bond joints, and thermal damage. Two of the five blade tips were located. Damage to the mast support structure, main rotor hub, main rotor blades and upper flight controls is consistent with power-on main rotor blade impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft section of the tailboom, which consisted of the vertical and horizontal stabilizer, tail rotor gearbox, and the tail rotor assembly, had separated from the rest of the tailboom. A long section of the tail rotor drive shaft was found near the center of the wreckage and showed evidence of torsional twisting. The two tail rotor blades remained attached to the tail rotor hub. Both blades exhibited impact damage, with one blade fractured outboard of the root fitting. The tail rotor gearbox and tail rotor swashplate operated smoothly when rotated manually. The tail rotor blades were also manually manipulated, and control linkages and mechanisms responded appropriately. The tail rotor gearbox remained attached to the mounting frame on the aft section of the tail boom section. The upper and lower sections of the vertical stabilizer leading edge and the horizontal stabilizer were crushed and deformed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine had significant damage from the postcrash fire. Most of the attached lines were consumed, as were the accessory section and support structure. The engine drive shaft had fractured at the flex couplings at both ends. The outer combustion case exhibited extensive crush damage. The engine mounts had fractured in overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB, Boeing, MD Helicopters, and Rolls-Royce performed a detailed wreckage examination at a secure hangar at Kahului Airport, Maui, Hawaii. The engine was partially disassembled. The gas generator rotor spun freely, and no damage was noted on the guide vanes and blades. The power turbine rotated only about 20° due to binding near the exhaust collector support. Engine control continuity could not be established due to thermal and impact damage. Drive continuity of the main transmission was verified by rotating the input shaft manually. The main rotor gearbox rotated smoothly and resulted in the corresponding rotation of the main rotor head and tail rotor output shaft. Flight control continuity of the collective and cyclic systems could not be established due to extensive postcrash fire damage. Flight control components located above the mast rails were fractured in numerous areas. The anti-torque control system was destroyed in the fire except for the aft tail rotor section, which functioned appropriately. No evidence of a mechanical anomaly or malfunction was found that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The airline transport pilot was conducting a local flight with one passenger. The accident flight was the pilot's third flight in the helicopter on the day of the accident; before that day, he had not flown the helicopter in nearly one year.  One witness stated that he saw the helicopter rocking back and forth before it \"spun sideways\" and \"a bunch of parts\" departed the airframe. Some reported hearing a \"clunk\" sound, and others reported hearing a \"pop\" sound. Another witness saw the main rotor blades \"seize,\" then \"snap off,\" followed by the tail rotor departing the helicopter. The witness stated that the helicopter then \"dropped out of the sky.\" The fuselage impacted in an open field, and a postcrash fire erupted. The separated main rotor blades and hub were found in a pond about 500 ft south of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the rotor mast showed deformation and fractures consistent with overstress under bending and torsion loads but no evidence of preexisting cracks or corrosion. The observed deformation of the mast was consistent with a mast bumping event. Mast bumping can occur in low acceleration of gravity (G) flight conditions, causing the rotor blade to exceed its flapping limits and resulting in the main rotor hub bumping into the rotor shaft. This often results in structural failure of the rotor shaft and a subsequent separation of the main rotor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to the extensive thermal damage to the wreckage, only a limited examination could be conducted; however, no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies were noted that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had accumulated about 15,000 flight hours in airplanes but only had about 55 hours flight time in helicopters, most of which were accumulated more than 1 year before the accident. Although the pilot had received instruction on how to avoid mast bumping, given his low helicopter experience relative to his airplane experience, it is possible that he made a large, abrupt flight control input that resulted in a low-G flight condition and led to the observed mast bumping. However, the pilot's control inputs are unknown, and the initiating event for the mast bumping could not be determined.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The NTSB database was queried for previous mast bumping accidents with Fairchild-Hiller FH 1100 helicopters. The FTW68A0085, NYC83FA102, LAX83FA362, IAD98FA049, and DFW07FA198 investigations listed occurrences of mast bumping findings and their reports are appended to the docket material associated with this investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB database also contained the CHI00FA266 investigation. Internal corrosion was observed within the main rotor mast on that helicopter. This previous investigation report is also appended to the docket material associated with this investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21A), in part, stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLow-G Conditions and Mast Bumping&#x0D;\nLow acceleration of gravity (low-G or weightless) maneuvers create specific hazards for helicopters, especially those with semirigid main rotor systems because helicopters are primarily designed to be suspended from the main rotor in normal flight with only small variations for positive G load maneuvers. Since a helicopter low-G maneuver departs from normal flight conditions, it may allow the airframe to exceed the manufacturer's design criteria. A low-G condition could have disastrous results, the best way to prevent it from happening is to avoid the conditions in which it might occur.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLow-G conditions are not about the loss of thrust, rather the imbalance of forces. Helicopters are mostly designed to have weight (gravity pulling down to the earth) and lift opposing that force of gravity. Low-G maneuvers occur when this balance is disturbed. An example of this would be placing the helicopter into a very steep dive. At the moment of pushover, the lift and thrust of the rotor is forward, whereas gravity is now vertical or straight down. Since the lift vector is no longer vertical and opposing the gravity (or weight) vector, the fuselage is now affected by the tail rotor thrust below the plane of the main rotor. This tail rotor thrust moment tends to make the helicopter fuselage tilt to the left. Pilots then apply right cyclic inputs to try to correct for the left. Since the main rotor system does not fully support the fuselage at this point, the fuselage continues to roll and the pilot applies more right cyclic until the rotor system strikes the mast (mast bumping), often ending with unnecessary fatal results. In mast bumping, the rotor blade exceeds its flapping limits, causing the main rotor hub to \"bump\" into the rotor shaft. The main rotor hub's contact with the mast usually becomes more violent with each successive flapping motion. This creates a greater flapping displacement and leads to structural failure of the rotor shaft. Since the mast is hollow, the structural failure manifests itself either as shaft failure with complete separation of the main rotor system from the helicopter or a severely damaged rotor mast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn situations like the one described above, the helicopter pilot should first apply aft cyclic to bring the vectors into balance, with lift up and gravity down. Since helicopter blades carry the helicopter and have limited motion attachment, care must be given to those attachment limits. Helicopter pilots should always adhere to the maneuvering limitations stated in the [rotorcraft flight manual]. There may be more than one reason or design criteria which limits the helicopter's flight envelope. Heed all of the manufacturer's limitations and advisory data. Failure to do so could lead to dire, unintended consequences. - The accident helicopter was issued an FAA standard airworthiness certificate on October 20, 1982, and was certificated for normal category operations. The Allison (Rolls Royce) model M250-C20B engine powered a two-bladed, teetering main rotor system. The engine manufacturer indicated that the rated horsepower for the M250-C20B engine is 420 shaft horsepower. According to the helicopter's type certificate data sheet, the engine had a takeoff power rating of 274 shaft horsepower (hp) for a maximum of 5 minutes, and a maximum continuous power rating of 233 shaft hp. The helicopter had a maximum gross weight of 2,750 lbs and could be configured to accommodate a pilot, another pilot or passenger in the cockpit, and three passengers in the cabin. The helicopter's flight manual had limitations to prohibit acrobatic flight and to avoid abrupt control movements when flying in turbulence. The helicopter's most recent annual inspection was completed on June 18, 2015, at a total time in service of 501.7 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn January 2004, the helicopter manufacturer issued Alert Service Letter 23 - 5. The letter indicated that several instances of internal and external mast corrosion had been discovered even when the mast was properly sealed. The corrective action was to remove the transmission top case, with the mast attached, and ship the assembly to the factory for non-destructive inspections. A special coating was to be applied on the interior surfaces. This process is only approved at the factory and cannot be performed in the field. Subsequent to the initial inspection, this process must be done at each overhaul of the transmission or every 10 years whichever comes first. - On October 6, 2016, about 1645 central daylight time, a Fairchild Hiller FH-1100 helicopter, N4035G, was destroyed when it impacted the ground near Lino Lakes, Minnesota, following an in-flight separation of the main rotor assembly. The airline transport pilot and passenger sustained fatal injuries, and the helicopter was destroyed.  The helicopter was registered to Helicopter Connection LLC, and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as personal flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local flight, which originated from the Anoka County-Blaine Airport (ANE), near Minneapolis, Minnesota, about 1620.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a pilot-rated passenger who had flown with the accident pilot in the helicopter earlier in the day, the accident pilot had not flown the helicopter for about a year and wanted the passenger to \"ride along\" as a safety pilot. Both the pilot and passenger performed a preflight inspection of the helicopter, which revealed no anomalies. About 1000, they departed on a 5-minute flight then returned and went to lunch. After lunch, they departed on a local flight, which lasted about 45 minutes. After the flight, the passenger asked the pilot if he wanted help moving the helicopter into the hangar, and the pilot indicated that he may fly the helicopter later.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLater that day, several witnesses saw the helicopter flying in a northerly direction. One witness stated that he observed the helicopter rocking back and forth before it \"spun sideways\" and \"a bunch of parts\" departed the helicopter. Some reported hearing a \"clunk\" sound, and others reported hearing a \"pop\" sound. One witness saw the main rotor blades \"seize,\" then \"snap off,\" followed by the tail rotor departing the helicopter. The witness stated that the helicopter then \"dropped out of the sky.\" Several of the witnesses saw parts departing the helicopter as it descended to ground contact. - An Anoka County Coroner arranged for the Midwest Medical Examiner's Office, Ramsey, Minnesota, to conduct an autopsy on the pilot. Toxicological samples were taken during the autopsy. The cause of death was listed as multiple blunt force injuries and the manner of death was indicated as an accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology testing on the pilot. Testing was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and all tested-for drugs. - At 1645, the recorded weather at ANE, about 4 miles southwest of the accident site, included wind from 010° at 6 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, overcast clouds at 6,000 feet; temperature 15°C, dew point 6°C, and an altimeter of 29.95 inches of mercury. - The 48-year-old pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with an airplane multi-engine land rating. He held commercial pilot privileges in airplane single engine land, airplane single engine sea, and rotorcraft-helicopter. The pilot also held a flight instructor certificate with airplane single- and multi-engine and instrument airplane ratings. He held a flight engineer certificate with a turbojet rating. The pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) special issuance first class medical certificate, dated August 16, 2016, with limitations for corrective lenses and not valid for any class after February 28, 2017. The pilot reported that he had accumulated 15,000 total hours of flight time and 400 hours of flight time during the six months before the medical exam. The last entry in the pilot's logbook was dated September 4, 2015, which was the date he passed his commercial rotorcraft-helicopter checkride. The pilot accumulated 55.5 hours of total flight experience in helicopters at the time of that entry, of which about 38 hours were in the accident helicopter make and model.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's helicopter flight instructor reported that, from April 15, 2015, to August 4, 2015, he provided instruction to the pilot in the accident helicopter to prepare him for his checkride to obtain a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. The flight instructor stated that the pilot had some trouble at first in the transition from fixed wing to helicopter and that this is fairly common for high-time fixed-wing pilots, such as the accident pilot. After some time, the accident pilot seemed to handle the transition as well as any other of his students that had previous fixed-wing time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instructor stated that he gave the pilot ground instruction on teetering rotor systems. When asked how the pilot responded during training situations that could precipitate mast bumping, the instructor stated that the pilot responded correctly to flight in turbulent conditions. He added that, during power loss simulations, the pilot initially was slow to lower the collective and would allow the nose to drop. Eventually, the pilot demonstrated proper entry into and proficiency in autorotations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's helicopter flight instructor reported that all the instruction he provided to the pilot took place near Lake Charles, Louisiana, and, after passing his rotorcraft-helicopter checkride, the pilot trailered the helicopter to the Minneapolis area. During the trip, one of the doors of the helicopter came open and cracked the windshield of the helicopter. According to the flight instructor, the pilot had just completed replacement of the windshield a short time before the accident. - The retained sections of rotor mast were examined by the NTSB Materials Laboratory. The mast showed deformation and fractures on slant angles consistent with an overstress fracture under bending and torsion loads. Deformation to the mast associated with impact marks adjacent to the fracture were consistent with mast bumping. No evidence of preexisting cracks or corrosion was observed. - The main wreckage came to rest on its right side about 4 nautical miles and 52° magnetic from ANE, on a heading about 20° magnetic. The area around the main wreckage was discolored and charred, consistent with a postaccident ground fire. The remaining sections of wreckage did not exhibit any evidence of pre- or postimpact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe initial piece of wreckage was a section of composite material located about 1,675 ft south of the main wreckage. A debris path extended to the main wreckage and contained the floor mats, a section of white interior material, an exhaust stack, exhaust duct, a section of the tailboom, the engine cowl, a section of exterior metal with the rotating beacon, a seat cushion, and a section of the tail, including the tail rotor and its gearbox. The separated main rotor blades and hub were found east of this debris path in a pond about 500 ft south of the main wreckage. All major components were accounted for at the scene.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage, consisting of the cockpit and cabin, was destroyed by impact and postimpact fire. Cyclic, collective, and tail rotor control continuity could not be established due to substantial damage to the cockpit and cabin areas. However, all observed control discontinuities were consistent with overload or thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine, transmission, and tail rotor driveshafts exhibited separations. All observed separations were consistent with torsional overload and overload. Circumferential witness marks were observed on the exterior of the tail rotor driveshaft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main transmission exhibited sections with thermal melting damage, soot-colored discoloration, and deformation. The separation surface at the top of the mast exhibited overload fractures. The mast could not be rotated by hand.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blades and hub exhibited overload fractures on the separation surface. Examination of the main rotor system and components found outside the main wreckage site did not exhibit soot colored discoloration or thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that several compressor blades were missing. The remaining compressor blades were found bent opposite the direction of rotation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA section of the transmission's main rotor mast and the section of mast from the main rotor hub were removed and were sent to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Materials Laboratory for detailed examination. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter flight crew, consisting of a pilot, copilot, and maintenance crewmember, was performing 20-knot rearward flight about 200 ft above ground level as part of a post-maintenance functional check flight (FCF). While the pilot was flying and recovering from the first rearward flight maneuver, unusual sounds were heard, which the flight crew identified as a compressor stall. The pilot then told the maintenance crewmember that they were returning to their home airport; however, after discussing compressor stalls and engine exhaust gas temperatures with the copilot, the pilot changed his mind and told the maintenance crewmember that they were going to try the maneuver again in a different direction relative to the wind (with the wind off the nose). While the pilot was recovering from the second rearward flight maneuver, there was a change in background noise, which the maintenance crewmember identified as a compressor stall. About 2 seconds later, there was another change in background noise, consistent with a decay in drivetrain rpm, which was followed by the helicopter descending and impacting the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the crew identified the sounds and loss of power as compressor stalls, a sound spectrum study could not characterize the gas generator speed (Ng) behavior, due to overdriven audio on the CVR, to determine the engine anomaly the crew identified as a compressor stall. It is likely that the cause of the overdriven audio is related to an engine anomaly. At the same time the engine anomaly occurred, the sound spectrum revealed Nr quickly decayed due to a dual loss of engine power coupled with a high collective setting. Because main rotor speed (Nr) decayed at the same time the overdriven audio occurred, it is likely both engines lost power nearly simultaneously. No anomalous damage to the engines was found that would have explained the dual loss of engine power and the main rotor drive system did not exhibit evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction. Fuel exhaustion was unlikely given the estimated fuel load at the time of the accident. After the overdriven audio, the rate of Ng decay for each engine appeared similar to engine Ng decay when at a lower power setting. Due to a lack of a flight data recorder or a cockpit image recorder, the behavior of the engines as well as the position of the cockpit engine control levers at the time of the anomaly could not be determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring postaccident examination, the left (No. 1) freewheeling unit (FWU) was found to rotate freely in both directions of rotation instead of rotating freely in only one direction as it was designed to do. Had the left FWU failed in flight resulting in a loss of drive between the No. 1 engine and the main gearbox, the No. 1 engine power turbine would have experienced an overspeed due to the sudden loss of load. A No. 1 engine power turbine overspeed would also have resulted in an overspeed of the AC generators due to a through shaft connecting the left FWU and the AC generators. However, during the accident loss of power event, the frequencies of the main gearbox planetary mesh and the AC generators did not diverge but remained synced, which is not consistent with a left FWU overspeed. Therefore, the anomalous finding of rotation in both directions for the left FWU is likely a postaccident artifact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the rotorcraft flight manual (RFM) emergency procedures revealed, \"2. If an abnormal engine conditions occurs such as engine stall, flame-out, or overtemperature, transition to single engine flight or landing….\"",
    "FactualNarrative": "The 41-seat capacity, tricycle-gear helicopter, serial number 61717, was manufactured in 1974. It was powered by two 1,500-horsepower General Electric CT58-140-2 turboshaft engines. The helicopter was maintained under a continuous airworthiness program. Its most recent inspection was a phase five check, which was completed on August 25, 2016. At that time, the airframe had accumulated 40,296.2 total hours of operation. The No. 1 engine had accumulated 708.9 hours since major overhaul (23,235 hours since new), and the No. 2 engine had accumulated 4,520.2 hours since major overhaul (26,259 hours since new). Following the phase five check, the helicopter had flown about 1.2 hours during the two previous FCFs. At the end of the second flight, prior to the accident flight, the flight crew reported total fuel onboard was 2,200 lbs. - The helicopter was equipped with a Universal CVR-120 solid-state CVR that recorded 120 minutes of digital audio. Specifically, it contains a two-channel recording of the last 120 minutes of operation and a four-channel recording of the last 30 minutes of operation. The four channels that should have been recorded during the last 30 minutes of operation were; one for the pilot, one for the copilot, one for the maintenance crewmember, and one for the cockpit area microphone (CAM). However, only two channels were recorded on the accident CVR during the last 30 minutes, with one channel being the CAM and the other channel a mix of pilot, copilot, and maintenance crewmember. The helicopter was not equipped with a flight data recorder nor was it required to be.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe CVR exterior sustained heat and fire damage, but the interior crash-protected case did not sustain damage. The memory board did not exhibit heat damage; however, the ribbon cable that connected the memory module to the main circuit board sustained heat damage and was replaced. Also, several electronic components were replaced to get the memory to playback successfully. The digital audio was downloaded, and a transcript was prepared for the accident flight. Additionally, about 9 minutes preceding the accident flight was transcribed; during this time, the helicopter was on the ground, and the pilot was calculating the weight and balance and center of gravity for the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA sound spectrum study was performed on recorded audio from the CVR. The study revealed that engine frequency could be correlated to Ng, and both the main gearbox planetary mesh and the AC generator electrical bleed-through noise frequencies could be correlated to main rotor speed (Nr). Additionally, CVR frequencies were compared to frequencies obtained from the witness video and provided a time correlation between the video and CVR. Plots were prepared to depict Nr and Ng through the two rearward flight maneuvers of the accident flight. The plots revealed that during the recovery from the first rearward flight maneuver, Nr decayed from about 102% to 100% and then oscillated between 104% and 101% before steadying near 102%. The Ng for both engines (average between both engines) increased from about 95% to 96% and then oscillated between 94% and 89% before returning to 95%.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe plots for the recovery from second maneuver revealed an increase in Nr from about 100% to 101%, followed by a linear decay to about 32% over a span of 9 seconds (the end of recorded data). Just before this Nr decay began, the Ng for each engine was about 95 to 97%. The Ng could not be characterized for a 3-second portion of overdriven audio, after which the Ng for each engine decayed linearly from about 83 to 88% to 71 to 76% over a span of 6 seconds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine manufacturer provided the National Transportation Safety Board with historical data of Ng reduction rates following a loss of engine power on CT58-series and CT7-series engines. The Ng reduction rate for the accident helicopter was slower compared to all but one of the previous events, which involved a CT7-9 engine where a fire handle was pulled while the engine was running at high power on the ground. Although the engine manufacturer did not have historical compressor stall data for the CT58-series engines, their compressor stall data on the CT7-series engines were not consistent with the data recorded during the two events. Lastly, the Ng reduction rate for the accident helicopter appeared comparable to that seen in an accident involving G-BBHM that the United Kingdom (UK) Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) investigated. In the accident involving G-BBHM, which was equipped with a flight data recorder (FDR), the No. 2 engine Ng decay was based on the crew retarding the cockpit engine control lever to \"flight idle\" after an engine fire warning light illumination, and subsequently to the \"cut-off\" position. Based on historical data of compressor stalls from the engine manufacturer, the plotted Ng data was not consistent with a compressor stall. (For more information, see the Spectrum Study in the public docket for this accident.) - On September 6, 2016, about 1340 eastern daylight time, a Sikorsky S-61N, N805AR, was destroyed when it impacted a field after experiencing a dual loss of engine power while in a hover near Palm Bay, Florida. The airline transport pilot, the commercial-rated copilot, and the maintenance crewmember were fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to EP Aviation LLC and was being operated by AAR Airlift Group under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a post-maintenance flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a company visual flight rules flight plan was filed for the local flight that departed Melbourne International Airport (MLB), Melbourne, Florida, at 1324.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the helicopter's fore/aft pitch servo had recently been removed and replaced. Subsequently, three functional check flights (FCF) were required to be completed. Two FCFs were completed uneventfully the day of the accident, and the crewmembers were conducting the final FCF when the accident occurred. One of the maneuvers to be performed during the final FCF was rearward flight at a computed airspeed of 20 knots. According to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the flight crew performed two of these rearward FCF maneuvers during the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVideo taken by a ground witness recorded the helicopter performing the first rearward maneuver about 200 ft above ground level. Correlation of the video to the CVR showed the helicopter flying rearward at 1337:25, when the copilot stated the rear speed was 15 knots. At 1337:40, the helicopter continued to fly rearward as the copilot stated the rear speed was 20 knots. Two thumping sounds were recorded on the CVR at 1337:42 and 1337:44, when the rear speed was about 31 knots, but corresponding sounds could not be identified in the ground witness video. The ground witness video then showed the nose of the helicopter pitch down as the helicopter transitioned from rearward flight to a forward left 90° turn and continued forward in straight and level flight. During the recovery maneuver, an event occurs which caused a 2-second region of overdriven audio to be recorded on the CVR. This occurred during the left pedal turn and while the helicopter was approaching 90° to the rearward flightpath. The helicopter then flew an orbit in increasing altitude, and the video ended.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the CVR, the pilot took over control of the helicopter at 1336:41 and the copilot, who was receiving flight training on the day of the accident, identified the thumping sounds as a compressor stall, and the pilot agreed. The pilot then told the maintenance crewmember that they were returning to MLB. At 1338:02, the flight crew discussed the perceived compressor stall and engine exhaust gas temperatures. Then at 1338:26, the pilot told the maintenance crewmember that they were going to try the maneuver again in a different direction relative to the wind (with the wind off the nose), and the maintenance crewmember stated that it was okay with him. At 1339:46, the pilot was recovering from flying rearward when there was a change in background noise, which the maintenance crewmember identified as a compressor stall. The audio for the cockpit area microphone was overdriven again from about 1339:45 to 1339:48. At 1339:48, the copilot stated that the \"AFCS is back on\" while there was another change in background noise consistent with a decay in drivetrain rpm. The recording ended at 1339:55.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no known witnesses to the impact. - The State of Florida District 18 Medical Examiner's Office, Rockledge, Florida, performed autopsies on all three crewmembers. The cause of death for all three crewmembers was noted as multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Science Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological testing on all three crewmembers. The results were negative for alcohol and drugs for the copilot and maintenance crewmember. Review of the toxicology report for the pilot revealed detected diphenhydramine in urine and heart blood and ibuprofen in urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIbuprofen is an anti-inflammatory analgesic available over the counter. Diphenhydramine is a sedating antihistamine available over the counter. The level of diphenhydramine detected in the pilot's blood was below the therapeutic range and not reported. - At 1353, the recorded weather at MLB, which was located about 8 miles north of the accident site, included wind from 070° at 11 knots, visibility 10 miles, and few clouds at 5,000 ft. - The pilot in the left seat held an airline transport pilot certificate with a rating for rotorcraft helicopter and commercial privileges in airplane single- and multi-engine land and instrument airplane. In addition, the pilot held a flight instructor certificate with ratings for rotorcraft helicopter and instrument rotorcraft. The pilot's most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) first-class medical certificate was issued on December 5, 2015. According to the operator, the pilot was hired in 2012 and completed all required company training. At the time of the accident, he had accrued a total flight experience of about 6,347 hours of which 5,743 hours were in helicopters and 1,780 of those hours were in the same make and model as the accident helicopter. The pilot had flown 114 hours and 25 hours during the 90-day and 30-day periods preceding the accident, respectively; all of these hours were flown in the same make and model as the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe copilot in the right seat held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft helicopter and instrument helicopter. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on May 16, 2016. According to the operator, the copilot was hired on July 31, 2016. He had completed company-required ground training and was in the process of completing flight training at the time of the accident. The copilot had accrued a total flight experience of 4,090 hours, all of which were in helicopters. Before the day of the accident, he did not have any flight experience in the same make and model as the accident helicopter but was qualified to act as second-in-command. - Regarding engine failures, the rotorcraft flight manual (RFM) emergency procedures stated, in part, \"if an abnormal engine condition occurs such as engine stall, flame-out, or overtemperature, transition to single engine flight or landing, confirm the malfunctioning engine has been correctly identified, and retard that engine to ground idle while proceeding as follows:…\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no published height velocity diagram for a dual-engine loss of power in the RFM. The RFM contained a height velocity diagram for a single-engine loss of power. Review of the diagram revealed instructions to avoid hovering below 300 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe RFM did not contain procedures for a loss of dual-engine power in either a hover or during rearward flight, and according to the operator, the company's training did not include loss of dual-engine power in a hover.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the FCF instructions in the maintenance manual revealed that one of the maneuvers was to fly rearward at 20 knots. The instructions allowed the maneuver to be completed at a \"0 – 1000 feet altitude…\" - The helicopter came to rest upright in a field with no debris path noted. The wreckage was oriented on a magnetic heading of about 190°. A postcrash fire consumed the cockpit and cabin. The tail boom transition section exhibited partial thermal damage, and the tail boom remained intact. The five main rotor blades and the five tail rotor blades remained attached to their respective rotor hubs. The main and tail rotor blades exhibited signatures consistent with low rotational energy at ground impact. Four of the five main rotor blades exhibited partial thermal damage, and one main rotor blade exhibited thermal damage along its entire span. One tail rotor blade was fractured about 1 ft outboard of the attachment bolt; the outboard section of the separated blade was found on the ground next to the tailrotor. Another tail rotor blade was partially separated about 1 ft outboard of the attachment bolt, and its tip was embedded in the ground. Drivetrain continuity was confirmed between the main transmission and the tail rotor gearbox.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth engines remained attached to the airframe and exhibited fire damage. Examination of the engines revealed that the first stage compressor blades of both engines exhibited little or no leading-edge damage. Both engine fuel control units were found with their respective control shafts in the \"FLIGHT\" position. Both engines were separated from the main gearbox at the aft end of the high-speed shaft. A boresope inspection of the helicopter's main gearbox was performed. No evidence of thermal damage was observed on the internal components of the main gearbox, and the interior coatings appeared in good condition. The gear teeth exhibited normal wear patterns consistent with typical service wear. No anomalous damage was observed with the gears and bearings. Additionally, the main rotor drive system was evaluated for continuity and all components operated normally. Manual rotation of the rotor brake disk resulted in corresponding movement of the main rotor head, tail takeoff pinion, No. 1 tail rotor drive shaft, and the two input pinion splined couplings (normally attached to the aft end of the high-speed shafts).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFreewheeling Units (FWU)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left and right FWUs were subsequently examined at the manufacturer's facility. The ramp-roller clutch engaged on the right FWU when rotated in the drive direction and disengaged when rotated in the freewheeling direction. No anomalous damage was observed on the right FWU.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the left FWU was rotated, the ramp-roller clutch remained disengaged and freewheeled in both directions of rotation. The splined nut was removed and exhibited no anomalous damage. Additionally, the ramps, roller elements, bearing cage, and bearing outer race did not exhibit anomalous damage. Further examination of the left FWU revealed that both bearing cage pins were observed to be in the retracted position. The bearing cage pin housings were labeled \"A\" and \"B\" for identification purposes. When both pin assemblies were removed from the bearing cage, each pin remained contained (and retracted) within its sleeve. Circumferential scoring was observed within the inner diameter of the bores that housed the bearing cage pin sleeves. Pin \"A\" was removed from the sleeve by pushing an Allen key through the hole at the rear end of the sleeve. Resistance was felt when pushing the pin out of the sleeve. Once the pin was pushed out, the spring exited the sleeve. The pin and spring were reinstalled into the sleeve, and subsequent compression of the pin resulted in normal operation of the pin-and-spring mechanism. Pin \"B\" was not disassembled and remained in its compressed position for X-ray examination. Circular contact marks were seen on the bearing cage tangs, consistent with bearing cage pin contact with the tangs during impact forces. The circular contact marks were more pronounced compared to those observed on the right FWU.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo. 1 Engine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA teardown examination of both engines was performed at an independent helicopter facility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nApplication of 25 foot-pounds (ft-lbs) of torque on the No. 1 engine starter dog (jaws) did not result in any movement of the engine core. Removal of the stator vane actuator (SVA) pilot valve cover revealed that the feedback cable remained connected to the pilot valve arm. The pilot valve exhibited no anomalous damage. The SVA pilot valve internal housing exhibited witness marks consistent with contact with the helical exterior of the feedback cable. The feedback cable could not be manually actuated and was found in a position consistent with the SVA in the closed position. The SVA housing was melted off from its piston, and remnants of the melted actuator housing were observed below its normally installed location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter removal of the accessory gearbox (AGB), application of 25 ft-lbs of torque on the starter dog did not result in any movement of the engine core. Attempting to manually rotate the AGB using the radial drive shaft was unsuccessful. The centrifugal fuel purifier (CFP) was removed from the AGB, and its external drive splines exhibited no anomalous damage. After removal of the CFP, manual rotation of the AGB resulted in minimal rotation with evidence of binding. The lubrication pump was removed, and both its internal and external splines exhibited no anomalous damage. The lubrication pump was not able to be manually rotated. The fuel control was removed, and the splined connection between the fuel control and fuel pump exhibited no anomalous damage. Thermally degraded O-rings were observed when the fuel control was removed from the fuel pump. After removal of the fuel control, manual rotation of the AGB resulted in limited rotation and a corresponding rotation of the drive splines to the lubrication pump and the CFP but not to the fuel pump-to-fuel control drive splines. During removal of the fuel pump from the AGB, one of the six studs separated and was retained in its mounting flange. The fuel pump could not be manually rotated. After fuel pump removal, manual rotation of the AGB was successful and resulted in a corresponding rotation of the drive splines for the fuel pump, lubrication pump, and CFP. The fuel pump external splines exhibited no anomalous damage. The front frame accessory drive gears did not exhibit anomalous damage. At this point in the engine disassembly, manual rotation of the starter dog was successful and resulted in corresponding rotation of the accessory drive internal spline (normally mating to the AGB radial drive shaft).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe second stage turbine rotor was removed, and its blades exhibited no anomalous damage or erosion. All blades were present, and both sides of the blades exhibited evidence of soot deposits. The first stage turbine rotor was removed, and its blades exhibited no anomalous damage or erosion. All blades were present, and both sides of the blades exhibited evidence of soot deposits with heavier soot deposits observed on the blades around the 12 o'clock position. Separation of the compressor case halves revealed all 10 stages of the compressor rotors, after which the compressor spool (with the front frame and rear frame still attached) could be manually rotated. All compressor blade surfaces exhibited soot deposits. The compressor blades did not exhibit evidence of damage consistent with hard or soft body foreign object debris ingestion or severe erosion. The six compressor stator stages exhibited no evidence of anomalous damage. Soot deposits were observed on the inlet guide vanes (IGV), all three stages of variable guide vanes (VGV), and the six stages of stators. From the 3 o'clock to the 6 o'clock region, the VGV tips were scored in the area between the second, third, and fourth stages. Impressions of the stator vanes were observed on the soot deposits on the compressor spool surfaces. Very light impressions of the last two stages of the VGV were observed on the soot deposits on top of the spool surfaces but impressions of the first stage of VGV and IGV were not observed on the soot deposits on the compressor spool surfaces. The power turbine blades did not exhibit evidence of anomalous damage or severe erosion; the blades exhibited discoloration, and the surfaces exhibited a rough appearance in areas that were not coated with soot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel pump cover was removed, revealing a thermally degraded gasket underneath the cover. The front coupling external and internal splines exhibited no evidence of wear. The internal splines exhibited a rust-colored residue on a portion of its outer diameter. The front (muff) coupling adapter splines exhibited no anomalous damage. Removal of the front cover revealed white-colored deposits consistent with corrosion; however, all components were subject to postcrash firefighting efforts and then stored in an open hangar before examination. A thermally degraded gasket was observed underneath the front cover. Two small, metallic globules were found underneath the front cover. A plug covering a port normally used for testing was removed, and a thermally degraded O-ring was found underneath the head of the plug.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rear cover was removed, revealing corrosion and thermal discoloration within the interior surfaces of the pump. Red-colored deposits were seen on the boost drive gear outer surfaces and about half of the gear web surfaces. The three shear posts were intact. The internal splines of the rear coupling, connected to the boost drive gear, exhibited no anomalous damage. The rear coupling was removed, and the retaining ring was still in its installed position. The driveshaft splines mating to the rear coupling exhibited no anomalous damage. Red-colored deposits were observed on the contact surface of the boost driven gear teeth, but none were observed on the non-contact side of the gear teeth. The booster driven gear bearing support contained white-colored deposits consistent with corrosion. The pump drive gear and driven gear teeth contained red-colored deposits. Small, metallic globules were found throughout the inner surfaces of the drive and driven gear body and cover bearings (where the gear face contacts its bearings). Removal of the drive and driven gear resulted in axial scoring of the pump housing. The drive gear splines exhibited no anomalous damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe impeller, with the boost driven gear still attached, could not be removed from the pump housing. A borescope was inserted through the fuel inlet port to examine the impeller. The leading edge of an impeller blade was visible along with red-colored deposits adjacent to the visible impeller blade.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo. 2 Engine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter removal of the AGB, the application of 25 ft-lbs of torque on the No. 2 engine starter dog did not result in movement of the engine core.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lubrication pump was removed and the internal and external pump drive splines exhibited no anomalous damage. The lubrication pump was not able to be manually rotated. The fuel control was removed, and the fuel pump-to-fuel control drive splines (both internal and external splines) did not exhibit anomalous damage. Thermally degraded O-rings were found when the fuel control was removed from the fuel pump. The fuel pump drive splines did not exhibit anomalous damage. A gasket on the fuel pump flange of the accessory gearbox exhibited impressions that mirrored the contact surface of the fuel pump. After removal of the fuel pump, neither the fuel pump nor the accessory gearbox were able to be manually rotated by hand. The front frame accessory drive gears did not exhibit anomalous damage. At this point, the starter dog was able to be manually rotated and exhibited continuity of drive to the accessory drive internal splines (which mates to the AGB radial drive shaft).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe second stage turbine blades exhibited no evidence of anomalous damage. The first stage turbine case was removed, and the shroud did not exhibit evidence of rubbing or blade contact marks. Staining of the shroud, in the shape of turbine blade airfoils, was observed around the circumference of the shroud. The second stage nozzle was removed and exhibited cracks near the leading edge root end of the nozzle vanes. The cracks were more extensive on three vanes centered about the 12 o'clock position. A crack was also observed on the trailing edge tip end of the nozzle vane. The cracks were measured to be about 3/8 inch in length. The first stage turbine blades did not exhibit anomalous damage. Separation of the compressor case halves revealed all 10 stages of the compressor rotors. Slight bending deformation in the direction opposite of normal rotation was observed on several compressor blades from various stages. Corrosion was observed on the vanes of the IGV and all three stages of the VGV. The spool face for the third stage VGV, between compressor stages 3 and 4, exhibited evidence of rubbing; corresponding rub marks were observed on seven of the vanes on the third stage VGV. The rubbing on the spool face was of negligible depth and could not be measured with calipers. Additionally, the spool face between compressor stages 5 and 6 exhibited evidence of rubbing of negligible depth. The remaining six stages of stators did not exhibit anomalous damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe front coupling splines and muff adapter did not exhibit anomalous damage. Remnants of a thermally degraded gasket and bellows were observed after removal of the front coupling from the fuel pump housing. After the pump cover was removed, a thermally degraded O-ring as well as small metallic globules on the cover bearings were found. The O-rings around the pump cover bearings were thermally damaged and exhibited a tackiness when touched. The rear cover was removed from the pump housing. The booster drive and driven gears showed no anomalous damage. All three shear posts on the booster drive gear remained intact. The drive gear hub exhibited areas of red discoloration. The driveshaft exhibited no anomalous damage. No evidence of blockage was found on the pressurized fuel outlet. Small metallic globules were found on the pump gears and bearings. The pump gears and the impeller exhibited no anomalous damage, but the gear teeth exhibited an iridescent coloration.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo.1 Fuel Control&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSoot was present on the exterior of the fuel control housing. There was no evidence of cracks, fractures, or melting of the housing. The retaining clip for the pressure regulating valve (PRV) housing was fractured at one of its ends, but lockwire remained attached to the fractured retaining clip end. Lockwire was present on the bolts securing the PRV housing to the fuel control. The fuel density adjustment dial tab was bent upward, and the tab was offset from the dial hard stop by about 40°. The PRV dial was at the JP-5 setting.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe gas generator speed (Ng) governor splines remained intact and the shaft exhibited axial and radial play when manipulated by hand. The disassembly technician noted that the shaft play was typical for the fuel control. When the power turbine speed (Nf) tachometer drive cable was manually rotated, the rotation was limited to twisting of the drive cable, and the drive cable would not rotate freely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe SVA rod protrusion from the housing was measured to be about 0.883 inches. The position of the emergency throttle was measured to be about 1.695 inches in depth. The flattened surface between the two emergency throttle rack gears was observed between the rack gear housings. The rack gears remained pinned together. The rack and pinion gears exhibited corrosion on its surfaces, but their gear teeth exhibited no other anomalous damage. Additionally, the cam did not exhibit anomalous damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe end cap was removed, revealing the minimum flow stop. The metering valve support was able to be rotated by hand; the metering valve support is normally torqued to 110 inch-pounds (in-lbs) at overhaul. The metering valve support inner diameter surfaces exhibited corrosion. The metering valve support was removed, revealing the metering valve. The metering valve surfaces exhibited corrosion. The position of the metering valve relative to the housing was about 3.56 inches, consistent with a lower power setting or engine spooldown. An attempt was made to move the metering valve by hand, but the metering valve appeared seized. Removal of the metering valve revealed the flow window opening was consistent with the metering valve being at the minimum flow stop. The spool and sleeve of the metering valve exhibited corrosion on its surfaces, and the spool was seized within its sleeve.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cover of the fuel control was removed, revealing the internal components of the fuel control. Generally, corrosion was visible throughout the surfaces of the internal components, but the visible components did not exhibit fractures or disconnection. All components exhibited freedom of movement except for the three-dimensional (3D) cam and the Ng governor gear. According to the disassembly technician, the internal configuration and condition of the fuel control appeared typical aside from the corrosion and thermal damage. The 3D cam was about at the ground idle position. The rack gear that rotates the 3D cam was found positioned to the end of the rack gear consistent with elevated ambient temperatures. The compressor discharge pressure (P3) bellows was vacuum tested and successfully held a vacuum for 1 minute.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo. 2 Fuel Control&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSoot was present on the exterior of the fuel control housing. There was no evidence of cracks, fractures, or melting of the housing, but several of the external bosses exhibited small dents. The retaining clip for the PRV housing was intact, and lockwire was present on the bolts securing the PRV housing to the fuel control. The fuel density adjustment dial tab was not bent, and the tab was offset from the dial hard stop by about 40° to 45°. The PRV dial was at the JP-5 setting.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Ng governor splines remained intact, and the shaft exhibited axial and radial play when manipulated by hand. The disassembly technician noted that the shaft play was typical for the fuel control. When the Nf tachometer drive cable was manually rotated, the rotation was limited to twisting of the drive cable, and the drive cable would not rotate freely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe SVA rod protrusion from the housing was measured to be about 0.965 inches. The SVA rod could be manually pushed downward. The SVA feedback arm was free to move and exhibited continuity to the rocker within the pilot valve assembly. On the fuel control throttle, the gap between the throttle maximum stop and throttle pad surface was measured. That measurement was replicated on an exemplar fuel control on a test bench, and the throttle position was found to be about 85°. The position of the emergency throttle was measured to be about 1.698 inches in depth. The flattened surface between the two emergency throttle rack gears was observed between the rack gear housings. The rack gears remained pinned together. The rack and pinion gears did not exhibit anomalous damage. Additionally, the cam did not exhibit anomalous damage. The pinion gear and cam rotated freely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe end cap was removed, revealing the minimum flow stop. Based on the relative position of the pin to the minimum flow adjustment screw stop, the metering valve appeared to be at the minimum flow stop. The maximum flow stop was removed and exhibited thermal distress and corrosion on its surface. Remnants of thermally degraded packing and the backup ring were observed in the grooves in which they are normally installed. The sleeve and boss were removed and exhibited thermal distress and corrosion on its surfaces. The metering valve support was able to be rotated by hand; the metering valve support is normally torqued to 110 in-lbs at overhaul. The metering valve support was removed, revealing the metering valve. The metering valve surfaces exhibited corrosion, but relatively less corrosion compared to the No. 1 fuel control metering valve. The position of the metering valve relative to the housing was about 3.615 inches, consistent with a low power setting or engine spooldown. The spool and sleeve of the metering valve did not exhibit corrosion to the extent observed on the spool and sleeve of the No. 1 fuel control metering valve. The packing was present on the valve but was hard to the touch. The metering valve spool was seized within its sleeve.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cover of the fuel control was removed, revealing the internal components of the fuel control. Generally, the surface condition of the internal components did not exhibit corrosion to the extent observed on the No. 1 fuel control. The internal components did not exhibit fractures or disconnection. All components exhibited freedom of movement. According to the disassembly technician, the internal configuration and condition of the fuel control appeared typical to those seen at overhaul. The 3D cam was at a relatively higher axial position compared to the 3D cam of the No. 1 fuel control. The 3D cam was also positioned about mid-travel on its rack gear. The P3 bellows was vacuum tested and successfully held a vacuum for 1 minute.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n(For more information, see the Airworthiness Group Chairman's Factual Report in the public docket for this accident.) -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The flight instructor and student pilot were flying the helicopter near dusk about 1,100 ft above ground level (agl) when the instructor initiated a practice autorotation, by reducing the throttle to idle. The engine subsequently experienced a total loss of power; the instructor attempted to restart the engine, but, was unsuccessful. The student provided conflicting statements regarding who was controlling the helicopter during the autorotation and landing, but stated that he started the landing flare about 25 ft agl. He further stated that he did not think that the helicopter's descent had been sufficiently slowed before the helicopter impacted the ground. Upon impact, the tail boom partially separated and the helicopter rolled over, coming to rest on its right side.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter and engine did not reveal any mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Impact damage precluded any functional testing of the engine and its components, and the reason for the reported loss of engine power could not be determined. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's flight manual stated that an engine restart should not be attempted below 2,000 ft agl, and that, below that altitude, the pilot should conduct a normal autorotation to landing. The manual also stated that the fuel boost pump should be activated before a practice autorotation. The fuel boost pump switch was found in the OFF position. The manual also states that rapid throttle reductions to full idle during flight shall not be conducted at any altitude to minimize the possibility of engine stoppage.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The Pilot's Flight Manual found at the accident site was last updated in June 2000. According to the manufacturer, there had been nine revisions since that date, with the latest revision November 19, 2014. A complete re-issue was published December 7, 2012, which included new warnings on practice autorotations and throttle management. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Pilot's Flight Manual (revised July 5, 1996) that was located at the accident site, Emergency Procedures, page 3-1, Section 3-1 Engine Failure – Altitude Above 450 Feet, stated in part: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     \"Lower collective pitch. Enter normal autorotation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Establish a steady glide of 52 knots (60 mph) IAS approximately. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     At an altitude of 50 feet, begin steadily to apply back cyclic stick to decreased forward airspeed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     At approximately 10 feet, coordinate collective pitch with forward movement of cyclic stick to level ship and cushion      landing. Make ground contact with ship level.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Pilot's Flight Manual (revised July 5, 1996) Emergency Procedures, page 3-7, Section 3-11 Air Restart stated in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     \"Pick out landing spot. If less than 2000 feet above terrain, proceed with autorotation landing. Pull mixture control to IDLE      CUTOFF when time permits to stop flow of fuel from nozzles.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Pilot's Flight Manual (revised June 15, 1994) Normal Procedures pages, 4-20 to 4-22, Pilot's Check of Idle Mixture, Idle Speed, and Fuel Boost Pump, stated in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     \"NOTE: This check of idle mixture, idle speed, and fuel boost pump shall be accomplished at the end of the last flight each      day, prior to engine shutdown.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Accomplish the engine idle mixture check as follows:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Land from a hover with engine cylinder head temperature and oil temperature as near to in-flight conditions as possible,      friction on the collective and cyclic controls, governor disengaged, and engine speed at operational rpm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Ensure MIXTURE is set to FULL RICH.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Rapidly rotate throttle to CLOSED position. (Set at normal idle stop, do not override.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     NOTE: Engine speed with immediately decrease to idle level. Rotor speed, however, will decline gradually. The next step      must be performed before rotor tachometer needle superimposes with engine tachometer needle. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Observe engine tachometer need and smoothly move mixture control toward IDLE CUTOFF position. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Return mixture control to FULL RICH before the rpm decreases to a point where the engine will stop. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     NOTE: Engine rpm rise is required to be between 25 and 100 rpm for this check.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     If rpm rise is not within the required limits, notify the appropriate maintenance personnel to perform proper idle speed and      mixture adjustments. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Accomplish an idle speed check as follows:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Operate helicopter at operational rpm with rotor system engaged, friction on the collective and cyclic controls, and governor      disengaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Rapidly rotate throttle closed and into full override position. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Read and record engine idle rpm to engine and rotor tachometer needles superimposing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     With engine head temperature near 300 degrees F, but not above, repeat the three preceding steps, without going into full      override (set throttle at normal idle stop).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     NOTE: The first check (throttle into full override) should produce an idle speed no less than 1400 rpm. The second check      (throttle at normal idle stop) should produce an idle speed no greater than 1600 rpm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     If engine idle speed is not within the required limits, notify the appropriate maintenance personnel to perform adjustments      in accordance with the Basic HMI.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe November 2014 revision of the Pilot's Flight Manual Normal and Emergency Procedures sections included the following warnings and instructions:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     \"Engine idle speeds at high density altitude may be less than those set at sea level conditions. Do not rapidly reduce throttle      to idle stop in flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     WARNING – To minimize possibility of engine stoppage, rapid throttle reductions to full idle during flight shall not be      conducted at any altitude.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     \"WARNING – During power recovery from practice autorotations, airspeed and altitude combinations that are inside the      height velocity curve shall be avoided. High rates of descent may develop from which recovery may be difficult or not      possible.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     WARNING – Practice autorotations shall be conducted in an area with a suitable landing site available to minimize hazards      associated with inadvertent engine stoppage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     WARNING – To reduce the chance of engine stoppage when initiating practice autorotations or simulated forced landing      training the throttle shall not be abruptly retarded to the idle position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     CAUTION – At high power settings an overspeed might occur if throttle is not reduced slightly when collective is lowered.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     Ensure fuel boost pump is activated prior to commencing autorotation training. Split the needles by reducing throttle      slightly and lowering the collective. The throttle correlation will establish a high idle rpm (approximately 2500 rpm) which      will aid in preventing the engine from loading up or stalling during recovery. Conversely, for recovery, increase throttle      slightly when the collective is raised, the correlation is such that only minor throttle adjustments will be required to perform      a smooth recovery without exceeding 3200 rpm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n     If engine stops make a touchdown auto landing.\" - The helicopter's most recent annual inspection (which included an annual, 100, 200, 400 and 24-month inspections) was completed on August 10, 2015, at a total airframe time of 5,624 hours and a Hobbs meter time of 13.0 hours. At the time of the inspection, the engine had accumulated 3,664.6 total hours and 392.6 hours since overhaul. The Hobbs meter time at the accident site was 52.7 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of maintenance records revealed no entries or comments related to idle/mixture adjustments or settings. - On August 9, 2016, at 2035 central daylight time, a Hughes 269C helicopter, N9277R, impacted terrain following an autorotation near Howe, Texas. The flight instructor was fatally injured, the student pilot sustained serious injuries, and the helicopter sustained substantial damage. The helicopter was privately owned and operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed. The local instructional flight departed the Sherman Municipal Airport (SWI), Sherman, Texas, at an unknown time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe student pilot reported to a law enforcement officer who responded to the accident that he and the flight instructor were flying about 1,100 ft above ground level (agl) when the instructor initiated a practice autorotation which included reducing the throttle to idle to simulate an engine failure. When the engine power was reduced, the engine experienced a total loss of power. The flight instructor attempted to restart the engine, but was unsuccessful. The student stated that the autorotation was initially controlled, but then the helicopter impacted terrain in a high-speed descent. During the impact, the tail boom partially separated, and the helicopter rolled over, coming to rest on its right side.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a written statement, the student reported that he and the instructor had completed some landings and other operations at SWI, and were returning to his residence at an altitude about 1,200 ft agl. While en route, the instructor \"slowly rolled down the throttle to simulate [an] engine failure.\" After noticing the throttle reduction, the student lowered the collective and looked for an appropriate place to land. The student and instructor then noticed the engine rpm gauge was reading zero. The student stated that both he and the instructor were \"on the controls\" during the autorotation. The student recalled starting to flare about 25 ft agl, and did not recall any details after the flare. The student reported, \"I feel we didn't slow the descent enough before contacting the ground...\" The student exited the helicopter and attempted, unsuccessfully, to extricate the instructor. He then went to search for assistance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, who spoke with the student after the accident, the student stated that the instructor never touched or manipulated the flight controls during the flight and during the accident sequence. - The instructor died in the hospital on August 10, 2016. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Dallas County Office of the Medical Examiner, Dallas, Texas, performed an autopsy on the instructor. The autopsy report stated that the cause of death was blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed forensic toxicology on specimens from the flight instructor. The results were negative for carbon monoxide and ethanol. Testing identified Acetaminophen (31.2 (ug/ml) in the urine, glucose (160 mg/dl) in vitreous, glucose (18 mg/dl) in urine, and the blood sample was unsuitable for analysis of Hemoglobin A1C.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAcetaminophen is a pain and fever reliever commonly sold under the trade name Tylenol. - Review of sun and moon data from the U.S. Naval Observatory revealed that, on the day of the accident, sunrise was at 0644, sunset was 2018, and the end of civil twilight was 2045. - According to the FAA inspector who spoke with the student, the student had accumulated 25 flight hours with a local helicopter flight school before flying with the accident instructor. He'd stopped flying with the local flight school in October 2012. Since October 2015, the student had flown several flights with the instructor and had accumulated 63.7 total flight hours at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to law enforcement, on July 12, 2014, the student had been involved in a previous accident in the same make/model helicopter. The student stated to the FAA inspector that he was moving the helicopter when the helicopter \"got away from him.\" The accident was not reported to the NTSB. - The helicopter impacted down sloping grassy terrain adjacent to wooded areas and residential structures. The main wreckage consisted of the fuselage, a portion of the tail boom, and the main rotor system. The landing gear skids were spread apart and bent up into the fuselage. The instrument panel was partially separated from the fuselage. The fuel boost pump switch was found in the OFF position. The right seat anti-torque pedals were separated from the pedal supports. Both the left and right seat bottom panels were crushed downward about 4 inches. Flight control continuity was established from the cockpit to all flight controls in the main rotor and tail rotor systems. The three main rotor blades were bent and deformed, and remained attached to the rotor head.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUpon their arrival to the accident site, first responders noted that fuel was draining from the fuel tanks. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was recovered to a secure storage facility for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn August 30, 2016, the helicopter was examined by the NTSB investigator-in-charge, a representative from the FAA rotorcraft directorate, representatives from Sikorsky Aircraft, and a representative from Lycoming Engines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe revealed the mast was intact and three support struts were straight and attached. The transmission was intact and remained attached to the steel center frame. The steel tube support frame exhibited bending, buckling, and fractures. The two forward cockpit floor support struts were fractured. The cockpit floor was separated from the base of the seat deck. The door frames were fractured and separated. The aft cabin wall was distorted and wrinkled at bottom attach area to the seat deck. The canopy frame was fractured and separated with all Plexiglas broken and separated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blades remained attached to the rotor head, and the blades were intact. The yellow blade was bent up at the root end doubler, bowed down at mid-span, and upward at the blade tip. Chordwise crushing and trailing edge wrinkles were noted about mid-span. White paint transfer, consistent with contact with the airframe, was noted on the bottom leading edge. The blue blade was bent downward at the root end doubler, bowed upward near mid-span, and downward at the tip. White paint transfer was present near the blade tip. The red blade was bent downward at the root end doubler. The blade was relatively straight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor head was intact and attached to the drive shaft. The rotor head turned freely in the mast bearing with continuity through the main gear box. The three upper main rotor hub attach bolts exhibited compression damage. The compression damage was consistent with contact from the pitch bearing shaft from a high upward blade movement. The blade up-flapping/coning was consistent with blade to ground contact. The droop stop ring was not present.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom was fractured at the center bulkhead rivet line, and the forward section was separated from the steel tube frame and strut at the forward bulkhead. Both tail boom support struts were fractured at the lower tabs in a downward direction. A main rotor blade contact dent was noted aft of the center attach fitting, at the internal damper location. The left support strut remained attached to the tail boom and exhibited a long black mark on the outside lower portion of the tube, consistent with main rotor blade contact. The horizontal stabilizer displayed downward bending damage and skin buckling at the forward attachment to the tail boom. The lower vertical stabilizer sustained crush damage consistent with ground contact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor blades remained attached to the hub. Both blades displayed minor airfoil damage. One blade was intact and straight, and one blade was fractured at the end of the hub. The tail rotor driveshaft was separated at the forward end from the main gear box pinion drive spline. The driveshaft remained in one piece, but was buckled and folded aft at the boom separation point. The driveshaft exhibited torsional twisting near the forward end with twisting in the direction of rotation, consistent with tail rotor contact prior to separation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left landing gear skid remained attached to the forward cross beam at the strut and damper. The left aft skid was separated at the strut to cross beam, with the fracture consistent with overload failure. The right landing gear skid forward strut remained attached to the crossbeam, and the aft strut separated at the crossbeam. The skid was bent between the forward and aft strut attach points, and fractured forward of the forward strut.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained partially attached to the airframe. The exhaust pipes were crushed, deformed, and displaced, consistent with ground contact. The fuel injector body exhibited impact marks consistent with forward landing gear crossbeam contact. The throttle bellcrank linkage was fractured and separated from the bottom of inlet adapter mount.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine control continuity was established from the cockpit controls to the engine components; however, full motion was restricted due to airframe deformation. Thumb compression and valve motion was noted on all cylinders. The magnetos were removed and rotated with a portable drill, and all eight spark plug leads produced spark. The fuel injector nozzles were removed and all nozzles exhibited some carbon on the orifice tips. The fuel injector body bore exhibited carbon deposits. The drained oil from the crankcase was black in color. The engine could not be functionally tested due to damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBlue fuel stains were noted from the filler caps on both the main (left) and auxiliary (right) fuel tanks. A puncture was noted in the bottom of the auxiliary tank, and no fuel was present in the fuel tanks. Fuel was found in the fuel injector and fuel pump. -",

When the helicopter failed to arrive as scheduled, a search was initiated. The helicopter was located partially submerged in a remote, thickly wooded cypress swamp. The damage to the helicopter and to surrounding trees indicated that the helicopter was in a near-vertical descent with a nose-down attitude at impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact discrepancies or anomalies, and damage to the main rotor blades was consistent with the engine producing power at impact. Review of weather information revealed that there was a large thunderstorm complex in the area, but it did not extend over the accident site. The closest weather station, located about 18 miles from the accident site, was reporting visual flight rules to marginal flight rules conditions due to light rain and a broken-to-overcast cloud layer. Due to an overcast layer of high cirriform clouds over the accident site, it was not possible to determine if any low clouds were in the immediate vicinity of the accident site. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with a loss of control by the pilot. The reason for the pilot's loss of helicopter control could not be determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter, serial number 0219, was manufactured by the Schweizer Helicopter Corporation in 2005. It was powered by a Lycoming HIO-360-G1A engine (serial number RL-29952-51E), rated at 180 horsepower. Power from the engine was transmitted through eight drive belts and two drive shafts to the three-bladed main rotor and the two-bladed tail rotor. The helicopter had a gross weight of 1,750 pounds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the maintenance records, the helicopter's last annual inspection was on September 20, 2015, and the last 100-hour inspection was on July 28, 2016, when the helicopter had accrued 5,595.4 flight hours. The engine was remanufactured by Lycoming on March 6, 2013, and it had accrued 4,199.2 flight hours at that time. - On August 3, 2016, about 1047 central daylight time, a Schweizer 269C-1 helicopter, N1549W, was destroyed when it impacted trees in swampy terrain near Jeanerette, Louisiana. The commercial pilot was fatally injured. The flight was being operated by Gulf Coast Helicopters, Inc., as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 pipeline patrol flight, and no flight plan had been filed. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the low-altitude cross-country flight. The flight originated from the Louisiana Regional Airport (L38), Gonzales, Louisiana, about 0730 and was destined for the Harry P. Williams Memorial Airport (PTN), Patterson, Louisiana.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was completing a scheduled biweekly patrol of a series of intersecting pipelines. When the helicopter failed to arrive at PTN, the operator notified the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). An alert notice was issued, and a search was initiated. The helicopter wreckage was found the next day partially submerged in the Atchafalaya Basin, a remote, thickly wooded cypress swamp, about 15 miles east of Jeanerette, Louisiana. - According to the Louisiana Forensic Center's autopsy report, the pilot's cause of death was \"blunt force injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the toxicology screen performed by the FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, no carbon monoxide or drugs were detected in the pilot's blood. A cyanide test was not performed. The pilot tested positive for ethanol: 71 mg/dL in brain tissue, 60 mg/dL in muscle tissue, and 54 mg/dL in blood. N-butanol was detected in blood, and N-propanol was detected in muscle, brain tissue, and blood. According to the laboratory, the ethanol, N-butanol, and N-propanol were most likely the byproducts of postmortem putrefaction. - The National Weather Service forecast chart indicated that scattered rain showers and thunderstorms were expected over southeastern Louisiana with summer air mass type convection. The surface analysis chart with a satellite composite image overlaid for 1000 depicted a large circular area of enhanced clouds associated with convective clouds or thunderstorms over southeastern Louisiana; the accident site was located adjacent to the eastern edge of this area. The area indicated an anticyclonic or clockwise wind flow. Cloud cover ranged from clear skies over the northern and western portions of Louisiana to overcast skies over the New Orleans area with thunderstorms and rain being depicted in that area. The national composite radar mosaic for 1045 depicted a large area of intense-to-extreme intensity echoes over southeast Louisiana with the strong portion of the echoes between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Only very light intensity echoes were depicted bordering the accident site eastward.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest weather reporting facility was the destination, PTN, located about 18 miles south of the accident site. At 1056, PTN reported visibility 5 miles in moderate rain and mist, a few clouds at 8,000 ft, ceiling overcast at 10,000 ft, and lightning distant northeast, east, and southeast. A thunderstorm began at 0957 and ended at 1019. Another thunderstorm began at 1021 and ended at 1049. Rain began at 1002, ended at 1012, and began again at 1029. Visual flight rules (VFR) to marginal VFR (MVFR) conditions prevailed at the station due to the light rain and broken to overcast cloud layer. The next closest weather reporting facility was Acadiana Regional Airport (ARA), New Iberia, Louisiana, located about 25 miles west of the accident site. At 1053, ARA reported VFR conditions with clear to partly cloudy skies with no thunderstorms reported. The next closest weather reporting location was the departure airport, L38, located about 26 miles north-northeast of the accident site. At 1035, L38 reported thunderstorms with light rain and lightning distant in all quadrants.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1045, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite number 13 depicted a large cluster of cumulonimbus clouds over southeast Louisiana with cloud tops near 45,000 ft. The enhanced cloud centers were located northeast through east and southwest of the accident site. The accident site was under the anvil outflow or cirrostratus clouds from the cumulonimbus cloud system. Strong active convection was noted in the system to the east of Baton Rouge and off the Louisiana coast with overshooting cloud tops. The overcast cloud cover over the accident site was associated with high cirriform clouds. Due to the extensive cloud cover, it was not possible to determine if any low clouds were in the immediate vicinity of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was on the border between the forecasts for southwestern and southeastern Louisiana. The forecast for the southwestern portion of the state expected scattered clouds at 3,000 ft, light winds, and no convective activity. The forecast for the southeastern portion expected scattered to broken clouds at 4,000 ft with tops to 14,000 ft with isolated thunderstorms and light rain. The cumulonimbus clouds tops were expected to reach 45,000 ft. The quantitative precipitation forecast indicated a chance of precipitation between 0.01 to 0.10 inches over the accident site. - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. He was not instrument rated although he had logged 5 hours in simulated instrument meteorological conditions. His second-class airman medical certificate, dated April 24, 2015, contained the restriction: \"Must wear corrective lenses.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's logbook was recovered from the submerged wreckage. It contained entries from August 8, 2012, through August 2, 2016. The pilot had successfully completed the practical test for a commercial pilot certificate on March 29, 2015, and according to the FAA, this met the biennial flight review requirements of 61.56 (d). At that time, the pilot had accumulated about 427 hours of flight experience.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Gulf Coast Helicopters, the pilot was hired on June 8, 2015. At that time, he had logged a total of about 488 hours of flight experience. The operator reported that most of the pilot's activity in the past year was pipeline patrol with most of that flying about 500 ft above ground level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on a review of the pilot's logbook, his most recent FAA airman medical certification application, information provided by the operator, the helicopter's daily logs, and other records, the pilot's flight experience on August 2, 2016, was estimated to be 1,611 total flight hours, all of which were in helicopters and more than 800 hours of which were in the Schweizer 269. The pilot had logged 1,069 hours in the last 12 months, 225 hours in the last 3 months, 72 hours in the last 30 days, and 8 hours in the last 24 hours. - The helicopter was partially submerged in the swamp in a nose-down attitude. There was a hole in the overhead trees, consistent with a steep descent. There were also blade strike marks on the tree trunks. The wreckage was recovered and transported to Air Salvage of Dallas, Lancaster, Texas, where it was further examined on August 31, 2016.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom was intact but separated from the steel tube frame. The main rotor blades were bent and separated. There was impact damage to the aft cabin wall, bulkhead, and forward side of fuel tanks. The seat deck assembly was compressed and folded back toward the aft cabin wall. The aft cabin wall was deformed and pushed aft. The forward sides of both fuel tanks were compressed and deformed, and the aft portions were intact and remained relatively in their original shapes. The mast was intact. The forward bulkhead mount tabs were fractured. The canted horizontal stabilizer was not present. The forward attach fitting remained attached to the tailboom. The lower vertical stabilizer was crushed and deflected to the right with a large rounded dent, which deformed the boom and was oriented about 90° to the longitudinal centerline of the tailboom.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing gear was damaged. Neither of the forward skids were present for examination. The left side forward strut was not recovered. All remaining struts and damper attach points exhibited damage consistent with the landing gear assembly being pushed aft. The aft crossbeam was intact and relatively straight. The forward crossbeam was bowed aft in the center section but remained straight in the outer ends. The right hand drag strut was straight and fractured at the aft rod end bearing threads. The left drag strut was bent in the middle nearly 90° with the forward end remaining attached to the crossbeam and aft end to the aft strut.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe yellow and red main rotor blades were bent in a spanwise downward direction. The blue blade separated near the root and exhibited minor downward bending, trailing edge wrinkles, and peeled upper skin near the tip. The red blade was bent up at the root with tearing and separation, and bent down about 90° midspan and down again about 90° near the tip. The yellow blade was bent down about 90° midspan and down about 30° near the tip. Both tail rotor blades were intact, straight, exhibited only minor damage, and remained attached to the hub. The main rotor head was intact and attached to the drive shaft. The swashplate was intact. The rotating scissors links were intact. The rotor head turned freely in the mast bearing. All three pitch housings remained attached to the main rotor hub. The pitch shaft droop stop lugs were intact and appeared straight. All three pitch housings rotated smoothly, flapped smoothly, and exhibited signs of contact with the upper hub, indicative of full-up flapping motion. All three main rotor dampers were attached at the pitch housings and the blade roots. The pitch change links were intact. The droop stop assembly was intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor fork and teetering bolt were intact. The assembly teetered properly. The pitch control unit was intact, rotated freely, and slid in and out on the pinion. It was attached to the pitch links, which were straight. The control bell crank was engaged in the pitch control housing and attached to the tail gearbox and the control rod. The tail rotor gearbox remained attached to the tailboom adapter, rotated, and exhibited continuity. The tail rotor drive shaft was bent at the forward bulkhead, and the drive adapter splines were intact. The main gearbox housing was intact, rotated freely, and exhibited continuity. The belt drive assembly was intact and did not exhibit damage. The upper pulley rotated and engaged the overrunning clutch properly. All pulleys were intact, all bearings turned, and the belts were intact. The engine drive shaft was undamaged. There was no evidence of preimpact discrepancies or anomalies with the airframe.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was generally intact. The fuel servo, engine-driven fuel pump, and the right magneto were still attached. Both magnetos were installed on a magneto test bench and rotated up to 2,000 rpm but no sparks were observed. The technician stated that the magnetos were probably not functioning due to internal corrosion caused by water submersion. The spark plugs were removed, and the engine rotated, producing thumb compression on all cylinders. Valve motion was noted on all cylinders. Fuel was found in the servo fuel screen, and no water was present. The electric boost pump was seized; the engine-driven fuel pump operated and pumped liquid; the gascolator was intact with some gas and water present; and the screen was not blocked. The fuel injector and the inlet fuel screen were clear. Fuel injector nozzles 1 and 3 were plugged with a foreign substance. Cylinder nozzle 2 was impact damaged. The remainder of the nozzles were clear and unobstructed. All fuel lines were secure, and the fittings were tight. Fuel and water was observed throughout the engine fuel system. Oil was observed in and around the engine during the engine examination. The oil system was complete and intact with no preimpact defects noted. The oil suction screen was contaminated with carbon deposits and plant material. Nothing was observed during the examination that would have precluded the engine from operating normally before impact. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The purpose of the flight was for an emergency response team to complete recurrent rescue hoist training from the helicopter. The three-person team included a rescue specialist, a system operator, and a safety officer. Each crewmember needed to complete 3 evolutions in each position to complete the recurrent training. During an evolution, the system operator would be positioned on the helicopter's skid while the rescue specialist would be lowered from, then picked up and brought back into, the helicopter as it hovered about 100 ft above ground level. After three evolutions, the pilot would land the helicopter; the crew would rotate positions and restart the process. According to a rescue checklist, the security of each member's safety harness was checked before each takeoff.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident flight was the seventh evolution of the day, and the first flight where the fatally-injured crewmember acted as the system operator. The safety officer and rescue specialist reported they  checked and verified that the restraints were secure. The helicopter then lifted off the ground, moved to the practice area, and the system operator requested and was granted permission by the pilot to move to the helicopter skid. The system operator stepped onto the skid and fell from the helicopter. The pilot stated that throughout the accident sequence, the crew was not rushing while they completed the checklists.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the system operator's equipment did not reveal any failures or malfunctions that would explain the fall. Additionally, examination of the tether to the helicopter did not reveal any abnormalities. In the absence of any equipment failure, it is likely that the system operator was not fastened to the helicopter.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The following items were listed in the Essential Hoist Operations Checklists used by the crew and were relevant to how the crew was tethered to the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSafety Checklist #1&#x0D;\n\"8.

RS 1 &amp; 2 on restraint.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the accident, the operator modified the Rescue Checklist # 2, to include an additional check that the Safety Officer and System Operator are tethered and anchored to the helicopter. - According to FAA records, the helicopter was issued an airworthiness certificate on January 14, 2014, and registered to the government in November 2014. It was equipped with two Pratt and Whitney Canada PW207D1, 610 shaft horsepower engines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe system operator wore an Aerial Machine and Tool Corp. H1037-BL/M full body harness rated to 2,900 pounds. It incorporated 4 tether points; 2 on the front of the harness and 2 on the back. Each tether point incorporated a D-ring that could attach to a carabiner connected to the interior of the helicopter. - On July 11, 2016, about 1850 eastern daylight time, a hoist system operator was fatally injured after falling from a Bell 429 helicopter, N1SP, while performing external hoist operations at Delaware Coastal Airport (GED), Georgetown, Delaware. The commercial pilot and two other crewmembers were not injured, and the helicopter was not damaged. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local public flight, which was operated by the Delaware State Police.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flight was for an emergency response team to complete recurrent rescue hoist training. The three-person team included a rescue specialist, a system operator, and a safety officer. During an evolution, the rescue specialist would be lowered from the helicopter. The system operator, located on the helicopter's skid, would retract the hook back into the helicopter, and the pilot would then return the helicopter to the original hover position in flight. Then, the rescue specialist would cue the crew to return to the target area (where the rescue specialist was located). The system operator would extend the hook, the rescue specialist would connect himself to the hoist, and the system operator would raise the rescue specialist back into the helicopter. Each crewmember was required to perform 3 evolutions as a rescue specialist and a system operator to complete the training. After completing three evolutions, the pilot would land the helicopter; the crew would rotate positions and restart the process. The system operator wore a full body harness and was tethered to the interior of the helicopter through a strap with a carabiner that attached to a D-ring on the harness. The security of each member's safety harness was to be checked before each takeoff during the performance of the second rescue checklist.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to each of the crewmembers, the accident flight was the seventh evolution of the day, and the first flight where the fatally-injured crewmember acted as the system operator. After the restraints were checked and verified secure, the helicopter lifted off the ground and flew to the practice area on the airfield. As the helicopter hovered about 100 ft above ground level, the system operator requested and was granted permission by the pilot to move to the helicopter skid. The system operator stepped onto the skid and subsequently fell from the helicopter. The pilot stated that throughout the accident sequence, the crew was not rushing while they completed the checklists.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot landed the helicopter immediately and the rescue specialist and safety officer initiated patient care on the system operator. - The FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological testing of the fatally injured crewmember. Fluid and tissue specimens tested negative for ethanol and other drugs. - The 1854 recorded weather observation at GED included wind from 060° at 6 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear skies below 12,000 ft above ground level, temperature 28°C, dew point 16°C, and an altimeter setting of 30.07 inches of mercury. - According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, rotorcraft helicopter, and instrument helicopter. His most recent second-class medical certificate was issued in August 2015. He reported 766 total hours of flight experience, of which 200 hours were in the accident helicopter make and model. His most recent flight review was dated March 14, 2016, and his most recent Hoist Class D External Load Designation Certification was completed on June 15, 2016.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rescue specialist, safety officer, and system operator were all qualified both as system operators and rescue specialists. All three individuals had most recently completed hoist operation training on June 15, 2016. - Examination of the system operator's full body harness by an FAA inspector revealed no evidence of failure or suspicious marks. No webbing, hardware, or stitching damage was noted on the harness. In addition, an examination of the restraint system secured to the interior of the helicopter revealed no anomalies, and all hooks and carabiners operated without anomaly. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was performing a visual approach to a landing zone to board an additional crewmember. A witness reported that there were no abnormalities in the helicopter's sound or position, until it was approximately 75 to 100 feet above the ground. Suddenly, the main rotor tilted to the right. Immediately after, the entire helicopter banked to its right and fell to the ground on its right side, where it came to rest. The main rotor blades broke apart during the impact sequence. The engine continued to run after the accident, and was subsequently shut down by responding personnel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of the wreckage revealed that the collective lever, located at the front and bottom of the swashplate support, was disconnected from the pivot sleeve. The collective lever was designed to move the pivot sleeve vertically on the swashplate support, via direct linkage from the cockpit collective control, to change the pitch on all the main rotor blades simultaneously. The collective lever pins and screws that attached the collective lever to the pivot sleeve  were missing; they were later found loose, near the main rotor area. The safety wires intended to secure the screws to the pins were missing. Examination of the hardware at the NTSB Materials Laboratory revealed that the safety wires not present, and the screws backed out over time, resulting in the complete loss of collective control in flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMaintenance on the helicopter was performed about 38 flight hours prior to the accident. The maintenance included a 24-month inspection that required examination of the flight control bolts and nuts. The collective lever pins were not specifically included in that inspection. Two mechanics and a maintenance foreman, all employees of the operator, performed the maintenance, and all reported during postaccident interviews that they did not recall removing the safety wire or examining the pins. However, the foreman added, \"I could see why it [examination of the collective lever pins] could have been done. The 24-month flight control bolt inspection was being performed, why not pull them and look at them too. I've done it before.\" Two of the mechanics reported that they would occasionally be \"pulled off\" one aircraft to work on another, and there was no work interruption policy in place. Thus, given that the safety wires were missing, it is likely that they were removed and not replaced during the most recent maintenance and that maintenance personnel did not recall taking that action due to possible work interruptions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSubsequent to the accident, the operator implemented numerous safety initiatives to prevent recurrence, including two independent safety audits, a formal fatigue risk management program, a Safety Management System, a formal tool/material accountability program, new work interruption policies, creation of a formally-trained Safety Officer position, and a formal process for the communication of safety-critical information.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Subsequent to the accident, the operator implemented numerous safety initiatives to prevent recurrence, including two independent safety audits, a formal fatigue risk management program, a safety management system, a formal tool/material accountability program, new work interruption policies, creation of a formally-trained safety officer position, and a formal process for the communication of safety-critical information. - The helicopter was a Bell Helicopter model 407, serial number 54106, built in 2012 and purchased new by the TVA. It was a single-engine helicopter of conventional construction and equipped with a four-blade, soft-in-plane design, composite hub, main rotor system, a full monocoque aluminum-skinned tail boom, and a conventional two-blade tail rotor system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was powered by a Rolls-Royce model 250-C47B turboshaft engine, serial number CAE-848434, with maximum takeoff and maximum continuous power ratings of 650 and 600 shaft horsepower, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was issued a normal category standard airworthiness certificate and was maintained under an approved aircraft inspection program. Between May 31, 2016, and June 20, 2016, the helicopter was at the TVA maintenance facility at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, and the following inspections were accomplished: annual/50hr/100 hr, 150hr, 300 hr, 300hr/12 month, 600hr/12 month, 1200 hr/2 year, 12-month and 24-month inspections. From June 20, 2016, until the time of the accident, the helicopter was operated about 38.4 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe collective lever was located at the front and bottom of the swashplate support. The collective lever and collective control link were designed to move the pivot sleeve vertically on the swashplate support to change the pitch on all the main rotor blades simultaneously. The collective lever was attached to the pivot sleeve with screws, washers, and pivot pins (see figure 1). Once attached, the and the specified torque was applied, locking wire would typically be affixed to the screw.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 - Swashplate support assembly, with collective pitch lever attaching hardware outlined in red.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe maintenance tasks performed during the inspections between May 31, 2016, and June 20, 2016, did not require the removal of the collective lever or the disconnection or inspection of the collective lever pins or screws. Although an inspection of the condition of the flight control bolts and nuts was one of the maintenance tasks performed, an inspection of the collective lever pins, screws, and corresponding lockwire was not included in that inspection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe maintenance and inspections of the helicopter's flight controls, including the collective control, were performed by two TVA airframe and powerplant mechanics and one TVA foreman, who assisted in the work and supervised the operation. All three employees were interviewed by FAA inspectors following the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne of the mechanics re-installed an anti-drive lever assembly. He did not recall removing the lockwire on the collective lever pin screws or removing the pins. He stated that the other mechanic performed the 24-month inspection of the flight control bolts and nuts. He further stated that the collective lever pins were not part of that inspection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe other mechanic performed the 24-month inspection of the flight control bolts and nuts. When asked if he removed the collective lever pins, he responded, \"No, I don't remember doing it. If anyone would have done it, it would have been me, but I don't remember doing it.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe foreman inspected the work performed in the area of the flight controls. He reported that the removal of the collective lever pins \"…was not part of the required maintenance performed.\" He was not aware that the pins were removed or that any lockwire was removed. He added further, \"I could see why it could have been done. The 24-month flight control bolt inspection was being performed, why not pull them and look at them too. I've done it before.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth mechanics reported that they would occasionally be \"pulled off\" an aircraft to perform work on another project. One mechanic stated that there was a lack of documentation of what parts were removed, such as a continuation sheet. - On July 11, 2016, at 1123 central daylight time, a Bell 407, N427TV, collided with terrain during the approach to landing at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Mayfield Customer Service Center, Hickory, Kentucky. The commercial pilot was fatally injured, and the helicopter was substantially damaged by impact forces. The helicopter was registered to and operated by the TVA under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a business flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Outlaw Field Airport (CKV), Clarksville, Tennessee at 1048.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to TVA personnel, the pilot flew the helicopter from Knoxville, Tennessee, to CKV, refueled, and then flew to the TVA Customer Service Center to pick up a maintenance lineman for the purpose of inspecting power lines and equipment.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a TVA lineman who witnessed the accident, there was a light wind from the south/southeast, and the helicopter appeared to be making its final approach from the north. The witness stated that there were no abnormalities in the helicopter's sound or position, until the helicopter was about 75 to 100 ft above the ground. He then observed the main rotor abruptly tilt to the right. Immediately after, the helicopter banked right, fell to the ground, and came to rest on its right side. The witness stated that he never lost sight of the helicopter and described the impact as very hard with no sliding or bouncing. He saw the rotor blades break apart. The witness then ran into the building to get help. The helicopter's engine continued to run after the accident and was subsequently shut down by responding personnel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInitial examination of the wreckage revealed that the collective lever, which connected the cockpit collective controls to the main rotor, was disconnected from the pivot sleeve. The attaching hardware for the lever was subsequently found loose in the wreckage near the main rotor hub. - The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Commonwealth of Kentucky, Louisville, Kentucky, performed an autopsy of the pilot. The cause of death was blunt impact injuries of the head, neck, and torso with traumatic/positional asphyxia, and the manner of death was accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Bioaeronautical Research Sciences Laboratory performed toxicology testing on specimens from the pilot. The specimens tested negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and major drugs of abuse. - Mayfield - Graves County Airport (M25), Mayfield, Kentucky, was the closest official weather station, which was 8 miles from the accident location. The M25 weather at 1135 included wind from 120° at 5 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, scattered clouds at 1,000 and 2,200 ft, overcast ceiling at 10,000 ft, temperature 26°C, dew point 22°C, and altimeter setting 30.06 inches of Mercury. - The pilot, who was seated in the right cockpit seat, held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commercial pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land, rotorcraft-helicopter, instrument airplane, and instrument helicopter ratings. He held an FAA second-class medical certificate with a restriction to wear corrective lenses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported 18,430 total hours of flying experience on his latest medical certificate application, which was dated March 31, 2016. TVA personnel reported that his flight experience in the Bell 407 was about 850 hours. He completed a flight review in a MD Helicopters MD530 helicopter on February 12, 2016, and a flight review in the Bell 407 on January 5, 2016. - The helicopter's front seats were equipped with 4-point restraints. The outboard (right side) restraint attachment point for the pilot's lap belt was separated from the airframe wall. The rivets were pulled through and attached on one side, and the rivets were sheared on the other side. The sheared rivets were not located; however, the rivet holes were elongated from shear forces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was not wearing a helmet at the time of the accident, nor were helmets required or provided for helicopter operations at the TVA. - The collective lever and attachment hardware were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for further examination. The collective lever, collective lever pins, collective lever pin screws, and washers were examined visually and by optical microscopy. All components were intact. Threads on the collective lever pin screws and the mating threaded holes in the collective lever were intact with no evidence of stripping. Holes for attaching lockwire were present in the heads of the screws and at an adjacent area on the collective lever, but no lockwire was observed attached at either location. Deformation at the edges of the lockwire holes was noted. Circumferential scoring was present across the entire face on one side of one of the washers. On one of the screws, thread peaks were flattened near the middle of the shank on one side of the screw consistent with contact with the collective lever pin hole bore with the screw partially threaded into place. - General&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on its right side, about 220 ft west of the intended landing zone (LZ). The LZ was a level, open, gravel-covered storage area for power transmission equipment. All four main rotor blades separated from the main rotor hub during the impact sequence. The aft section of the tail boom severed from the fuselage, and the tail rotor assembly remained attached to the aft section of the tail boom.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel and Hydraulic Systems&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's fuel system was not compromised and contained about 695 pounds of fuel. No fuel leaks were observed, and all fuel hoses and lines were secure. The airframe-mounted fuel filter was clean, and the fuel inside was clear with no particulates noted. Hydraulic fluid was observed in the hydraulic system reservoir. All lines and hoses were secure, and there were no leaks noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLanding Gear&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right skid of the landing gear was fractured fore and aft, above the saddle. The right step was separated due to fractured brackets. There was an impact mark on the aft portion of the right skid that matched the general size and shape of a ground scar at the point of initial ground impact. The front cross tube remained attached to the fuselage by one bracket, and the rear cross tube was not attached to the fuselage due to fractures at the support brackets.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuselage&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward fuselage exhibited crushing damage on its right side along the bottom of the fuselage. The center post of the windscreen was fractured at the bottom. The battery cover on the nose was damaged near the hinged area near the bottom of the center post. The transmission deck exhibited minor damage to its right side.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain and Tail Rotor Systems&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the main rotor blades revealed that all four rotor blades were fractured. The yoke exhibited fracturing near all four inner elastomeric shear bearings with \"strawing\" signatures on the flexures. The blue pitch link was bent outward towards the top with all pitch link hardware present and all cotter keys installed. The red and orange pitch change links were undamaged with pitch link hardware present and all cotter keys installed. The green pitch change link was bent and fractured from impact forces and was found near the main wreckage. Each blade exhibited bending and delamination. All blades exhibited ground impact marks on the leading edges.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain rotor continuity was confirmed by rotating the drive shaft by hand. Movement was confirmed from the drive shaft through the transmission to the mast. The transmission was visually inspected and no pre-impact anomalies were observed. The chip detectors were removed and visually inspected with no ferrous particulate matter observed. No abnormal sounds were heard when the transmission was rotated by hand. The transmission was not disassembled.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom was fractured near the aft bulkhead, just aft of the intercostal support and the fracture surfaces were consistent with a counter-clockwise main rotor strike to the ground. The vertical fin displayed scraping damage on its lower, outboard side, and the anti-collision light remained intact. The tailskid remained attached. Both the left and right finlets on the horizontal stabilizer were fractured and missing from the stabilizer from impact forces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth tail rotor blades exhibited minor ground impact damage; however, no rotational scoring was observed on either blade. The tail rotor was easily rotated in both directions with no abnormal binding or noises. The pitch of the tail rotor blades was manipulated by hand with appropriate control movement noted forward to the aft end of the fractured control tube. The flapping stops exhibited compression signatures with corresponding impact marks on the yoke.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward end of the forward short shaft remained attached to the output end of the freewheel unit. The aft end of the forward short shaft remained attached to the forward end of the oil cooler blower shaft. The oil cooler blower shaft was rotated by hand with slight binding due to shifting of the forward end of the aft short shaft. The forward end of the aft short shaft remained coupled with the aft end of the oil cooler blower shaft. The aft end of the aft short shaft remained connected to the hanger bearing. Rotational scoring was observed on the aft short shaft with signatures indicative of contact with the engine oil tank bracket. The forward end of the #4 tail rotor drive shaft segment was separated. The #3 and #2 tail rotor drive shaft segments were separated from the tail boom and were found adjacent to the main wreckage. The forward end of the #1 tail rotor drive shaft segment was connected to the hangar bearing with the aft end of the #1 tail rotor drive shaft segment connected to the input shaft of the tail rotor gear box at the Thomas coupling. Oil was evident in the tail rotor gear box. No chips were observed on the gear box chip detector.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight Controls&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left collective control was not installed. Collective control continuity was confirmed through the right collective and up through the servo actuators to the disconnected collective lever. The two collective lever pivot pins and screws that attached the collective lever to the pivot sleeve were not installed. The pivot pins and screws were found on the transmission deck and on the ground underneath the right side of the helicopter. The flat washers and lockwire were missing; the washers were later found during a subsequent examination of the wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left cyclic control was not installed. Cyclic control continuity was confirmed through the right cyclic and up through the servo actuators to the inner, non-rotating swashplate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left anti-torque pedals were intentionally locked in place by the operator before the accident flight. The right anti-torque pedals were fractured at the outboard bell crank of the pedal control tube; however, directional control was confirmed when the tail rotor control tube, located near the tail rotor servo, was manipulated by hand. During manipulation, there was corresponding movement of the fractured pedal control tube and the fractured control tube aft of the tail rotor servo.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained in place, and all mounts were secure. No external engine damage was noted during the inspection. The hydromechanical unit linkage was intact, and its rigging appeared normal. The helicopter was equipped with an engine inlet barrier filter, which was normal in appearance and did not appear to be obstructed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine-mounted fuel filter bowl from the combined engine filter assembly (CEFA) was full of clean, normal-appearing fuel. The CEFA fuel filter element was free of debris, and the pending bypass button was not extended. The fuel nozzle exhibited no anomalies, and some carbon formation was noted on the air shroud.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine-mounted scavenge oil filter on the CEFA was free of debris, and the pending bypass indicator button was not extended. The oil reservoir, which was mounted on the helicopter, was compromised, which precluded determination of the oil level. Both the upper and lower magnetic chip detectors were free of ferrous particulate matter. The engine gearbox oil was not drained.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo foreign object damage was noted on the compressor inlet guide vanes or on the impeller blade leading edges. The N1 rotor turned with some resistance and was mechanically coupled from the compressor to the starter generator. The N2 system turned when manipulated by hand and was continuous to the main rotor head. Due to deformation of the exhaust stack, the fourth-stage turbine wheel could not be inspected.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll of the external air, oil, electrical, and fuel lines were secure when checked by hand. None of the b-nut connectors were loose, and torque paint was present on the connections. No red indicators were visible on the electrical connectors.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was controlled by a full authority digital electronic control(FADEC), which contained non-volatile memory in the electronic control unit (ECU). By design, when one of the predetermined parameter trip points is exceeded, the ECU begins recording incident data at a rate of one record per 1.2 seconds. The initial trigger for this event was low rotor speed (less than 92%).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ECU was downloaded by a Rolls-Royce technical representative. A review of the data revealed no engine anomalies that would have precluded the engine from performing to specification before impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ECU also retained engine maintenance history data in the maintenance terminal section. There were no pre-event faults or abnormalities noted in the maintenance terminal data. There were multiple faults recorded during the event, which corresponded to the impact sequence. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The experimental research and development helicopter was undergoing developmental flight tests before type certification. On the day of the accident, the helicopter test crew was performing a series of one-engine-inoperative (OEI) tests at increasing airspeeds with a heavy, forward center-of-gravity configuration. (For the OEI tests, the pilots used OEI special training mode software to reduce the power of both engines to a level that simulated the loss of one engine.) The crew initiated the final planned OEI test at a speed of 185 knots. After the crew engaged OEI special training mode, rotor rotation speed (Nr) decayed from 100% to about 91%, and the crew began lowering the collective to stop Nr decay and increase Nr to 103% (the target Nr for recovery). About 5.5 seconds into the test, the crew stopped lowering the collective, and Nr only recovered to about 92%. About 6 to 7 seconds into the test, the helicopter began vibrating at a frequency of 6 hertz (Hz). The vibration was evident in both rotor systems, the airframe, the pilot seats, and the control inputs; the vertical vibration amplitude at the pilot seat peaked about 3 G. (G is a unit of measurement of acceleration; 1 G is equivalent to the acceleration caused by the earth's gravity [about 32.2 ft/sec2].) Nr remained between about 90% and 92% until about 12 to 13 seconds into the test, then began fluctuating consistent with collective control inputs; subsequent collective control input increases led to further decay in Nr. Nr decayed to about 80% as the collective was raised, and the main rotor blades began to flap out of plane. About 21 seconds into the test, the main rotor blades flapped low enough to impact the tail boom, severing it and causing the in-flight breakup of the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor, tail rotor, flight controls, powerplants, and rotor drive systems exhibited no evidence of preexisting malfunction before the vibrations began. The structural wreckage did not exhibit evidence that the oscillations themselves resulted in a structural failure leading to the in-flight breakup. Examination of the wreckage revealed no indications that the helicopter had been improperly maintained.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Helicopter Performance After Stop in Nr Recovery&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring previous OEI tests, the crew lowered the collective input to near or below 50% to allow Nr to recover. As airspeed increased during each test, the crew took longer to recover Nr to 103%. (At 102 knots, recovery time was 3.4 seconds, and at 175 knots, recovery time was 13 seconds.) However, after initiating the final OEI test at 185 knots, the crew only lowered the collective to 58% and subsequently only recovered Nr to 92%. While at 92%, the main rotor scissors mode was excited. (The main rotor scissors mode occurs when the lead-lag motions of the blades act in such a way that adjacent blades move together and apart in a scissoring motion. See the factual report for more information about the scissors mode.) The main rotor scissors mode excitation resulted in the 6-Hz airframe vertical vibration, which was transmitted to the crew seats and created a biomechanical feedback loop through the pilot-held collective control. A second feedback system, driven by the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) inputs to the main rotor swashplate, also continued to drive the scissors mode and its resultant 6-Hz airframe vibration. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBiomechanical Feedback&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBiomechanical feedback in the aircraft design industry refers to unintentional control inputs resulting from involuntary pilot limb motions caused by vehicle accelerations. The gain between the vertical acceleration and 6-Hz collective stick movement can be calculated by dividing stick movement by vertical acceleration. (If no biomechanical feedback existed, there would be no gain [0 inch per G].) During the accident, the collective stick moved, on average, 0.2 inch per every G of seat acceleration. The \"nonzero\" relationship between the control stick amplitude and the seat vibration illustrates that biomechanical feedback contributed to the helicopter's vibration. Further, a positive value of pilot gain occurred near 6 Hz, which indicates instability in the system (meaning that any input to the system will amplify as opposed to dampen). Thus, biomechanical feedback contributed to increases in vibration amplitude during this accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Although the helicopter manufacturer's design process for biomechanical feedback included software filters in the cyclic control laws to reduce certain types of oscillatory cyclic control inputs by the pilot, no filter was designed for the collective. Thus, the 6-Hz oscillatory collective inputs by the pilot were not filtered. As a result, a control feedback loop began when the pilot-held collective stick commanded an oscillatory collective pitch input (about 6 Hz) into the main rotor, increasing the 6-Hz vibration, which in turn increased the magnitude of the oscillatory (6-Hz) collective pitch input. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn addition, the gain between the pilot movement and the collective control stick movement in the vertical axis was never tested on a shake table before the accident. For the cyclic control, lateral vibration was introduced on a shake table. This test was conducted specifically for the helicopter model's side-stick cyclic since the manufacturer expected a different transfer function from that of a traditional cyclic. For the collective control, no such test was conducted despite this being the first helicopter with a side-stick collective control. While it is possible that the decision to not shake test in the vertical axis to inform the pilot model could have been influenced by schedule pressure, interviews did not suggest that decisions would have been different given the lack of anticipation of scissors mode and resulting aerodynamic effect. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAttitude and Heading Reference System &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AHRS is designed to detect uncommanded accelerations (such as the helicopter's reaction to a gust of wind) and reduce their effects by automatically providing corrective inputs to the main rotor swashplate. The AHRS detected and responded to the 6-Hz airframe vertical vibration in a manner that sustained the main rotor scissors mode and its resultant 6-Hz vibration. Specifically, analysis of the telemetry data revealed that the AHRS responded to the 6-Hz vibration with inputs to the main rotor swashplate analogous to a \"cyclic stir\" (when the cyclic control stick is moved in a stirring motion). The helicopter manufacturer's assessment of the AHRS-induced cyclic stir swashplate motion was that it would exacerbate the main rotor scissors mode. The AHRS is intended to respond primarily to lower-frequency uncommanded accelerations. Because the helicopter manufacturer did not predict an excitement of the scissors mode in the accident test flight conditions, the filter design of the AHRS allowed it to respond to the 6-Hz airframe vibration. Thus, the AHRS detected and attempted to attenuate the 6-Hz airframe vertical vibration, but its response instead exacerbated the main rotor scissors mode and its resultant 6-Hz vibration, closing the AHRS feedback loop.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReasons for Crew Stop in Nr Recovery&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators explored possible reasons why the crewmembers stopped their recovery from the initial Nr droop, including a reaction to an abnormal condition on the helicopter, distraction from the recovery task, or a conservative response due to the high airspeed. Telemetry data does not indicate the existence of an abnormal condition when the crewmembers stopped their recovery. In addition, the chase helicopter crewmembers reported seeing no distractions or abnormalities outside of the helicopter (for example, birds).  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTherefore, investigators focused on the crew's increasingly conservative response as the airspeed increased during the tests. During the previous OEI tests, as airspeed increased, the crew recoveries took more time to reach 103% Nr and collective response became less pronounced. During postaccident interviews, helicopter manufacturer test pilots indicated that they interpreted this trend as the tendency of the crew to be more judicious while applying collective at successively higher airspeeds to avoid recovering too fast and overspeeding the rotor or damaging the transmission.  Thus, the crew may have been more conservative during recovery at the helicopter's high speed during the final test. The chief test pilot also stated that if Nr had stabilized, the pilot would not have been in a rush and was possibly initiating a slow recovery. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs an experimental research and development helicopter configured to carry two pilots and with no passenger seating, the accident helicopter was not required to be equipped with either a flight data recorder (FDR) or cockpit voice recorder (CVR) under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 91.609. (When certified as a transport-category rotorcraft under 14 CFR Part 29, the helicopter model will be equipped with both CVR and FDR recording capabilities.) A combination CVR and FDR (CVFDR) was installed in the flight test helicopter but was not operational at the time of the accident. Although investigators were able to examine and analyze telemetry data, a properly functioning CVFDR would have recorded any discussions between the accident pilots that could have offered more information about potential abnormal conditions, distractions, or reasons for their stop in recovery after initiation of the OEI test. Additionally, cockpit image recording capability would have recorded any pilot actions and interactions with the aircraft systems including avionics button presses, warning acknowledgements, and any other physical response to the aircraft. Cockpit audio and imagery could have provided insight into when the crewmembers first felt or detected the 6-Hz vibration, how they may have verbalized their assessment of an observed anomaly, and whether they attempted any specific corrective action because of the vibration. Thus, the lack of cockpit audio or image data precluded access to data needed to fully determine why the crew may have momentarily stopped the collective pitch reduction to recover Nr and any corrective actions the crew may have attempted as a result of the 6-Hz vibration. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRegardless of why the crew stopped recovery of Nr at 92%, other helicopter test pilots suggested in postaccident interviews that continuous flight in the 92% to 93% Nr range was not abnormal for an OEI maneuver (in this model helicopter and another model in the helicopter manufacturer's test program). This is further supported by another model in the helicopter manufacturer's test program during which extended flight occurred in the low 90% Nr range. (The other helicopter model did not encounter any unusual behavior [rotor mode/vibration] during the test points with the extended recovery time, and the pilots did not receive negative feedback on the recovery time.) The lack of any negative feedback on extended flight in the low 90% Nr range may have reinforced that flight through that range was appropriate. On the pilot displays (specifically, the power situation indicator [PSI]) in the accident helicopter model, 90% to 100% Nr is depicted as a green range or arc. The decision to fly continuously in the 92% to 93% Nr range is consistent with typical pilot association of green arcs with flight regimes that are appropriate for continuous flight. The company's flight technology specialist stated that the colors (green arc) presented on the PSI were a precedent taken from the other helicopter model test program, which suggests that it was likely not reevaluated for appropriateness given the accident helicopter's operating limitations. In addition, flight testing was only conducted for continuous flight at 103% and 100% Nr with all engines operative; however, no testing of Nr continuously between 90% to 100% while in an OEI condition was conducted. Extended flight in the low 90% Nr range during previous testing of another helicopter model and the depiction of 90% to 100% Nr in a green arc on the PSI may have contributed to the pilots' decision to stop in the 92% range during the recovery from the OEI maneuver, which resulted in the onset and increase of the 6-Hz vibration. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCrew Response to Low Nr and Vibration&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInterviews with the helicopter manufacturer test pilots and engineers suggest that there were two ways for the pilots to exit the low Nr and, correspondingly, the vibration condition: (1) lower/reduce the collective to increase Nr or (2) exit OEI training mode, which would increase power available from the engines. About 1.5 to 2 seconds passed between the stop at 58% collective and the onset of the vibration. Had the pilots recovered Nr to 100%, it is possible that the main rotor scissors mode would have subsided and the airframe vibrations would have dampened.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLowering the Collective&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne option for recovering from the low Nr and vibration condition was to lower the collective to increase Nr. The investigation could not determine if the pilots' fluctuating collective inputs were deliberate when the 6-Hz vibration was dominant. Because the crew needed to be aware of low Nr to respond appropriately, investigators considered the available visual, aural, and tactile cues regarding Nr in the vibration environment.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe visual cues available to the crew included the crew alerting system (CAS) text \"ROTOR RPM LO,\" PSI numeric display, warning flag, warning push button annunciator (PBA), and the change of the PSI Nr display from a bar to an arc. The CAS text, warning flag, and warning PBA would have been flashing until acknowledged by the crew. Because the telemetry did not record crew button presses, it is not possible to know if the crew acknowledged these alerts. Studies indicate that visual acuity is negatively affected by vertical vibration, particularly in the 5- to 7-Hz frequency range (Lewis and Griffin 1980a; Lewis and Griffin 1980b). Results indicated that reading speed and accuracy degraded for amplitudes as low as 0.1 G (McLeod and Griffin 1989; Griffin and Hayward 1994). Further studies show that visual performance decreases with increasing vibration amplitude (Shoenberger 1972; Griffin 1975; Griffin 2012). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe vertical vibration amplitude at the pilot seat rose above 1 G from 10 seconds into the test until the end of the test, with peaks as high as about 3 G. Given the sensitivity of the human body to vibration frequencies near 6 Hz and the extreme amplitude of the vibration environment, the displays were likely unreadable to the crew (although the colors of the warning text, flag, and PBA may have been discernable). In addition, the change of the Nr display on the PSI from bar to arc may have been recognizable; however, reading of the needle would likely not have been possible in the vibration environment. Thus, the crew was likely unable to read visual information that provided specific low Nr information, although they may have had a generalized cue that Nr was low.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAural cues available to the crew regarding low Nr included the master warning annunciation and the sound of decreasing Nr. The master warning aural tone would have annunciated at 12.5 seconds and 16.8 seconds (continuing until acknowledged by the crew). However, this tone was associated with at least 21 other warning messages and was not unique to the \"ROTOR RPM LO\" message despite a technical standard that requires that low Nr have a unique tone associated with it. The master aural tone annunciating continuously was chosen for test flight because audio files had not yet been developed; the helicopter manufacturer pilots and test team had decided that some aural annunciation of low Nr would be enough to proceed with test flights but that the distinct tone for low Nr was not immediately needed for flight test. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAural cues can be used for redundancy if visual information is unavailable. The accident pilots were aware that a unique tone did not exist for low Nr; however, they likely were not able to retrieve unambiguous visual information to confirm the warning, outside of a change in shape of the rpm display. Had a unique aural warning tone been implemented in the helicopter, it could have provided a salient, unambiguous cue to the crewmembers that Nr was low. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRegarding the sound of decreasing Nr, under normal conditions, pilots can hear the decrease in Nr and would likely be able to tell the difference between 100% and 92% Nr. However, according to a postaccident statement by the helicopter manufacturer lead test pilot, it is uncertain whether the pilots would have heard the low Nr given the vibration environment during the accident flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe exceedance of engine limits, which can indirectly indicate low Nr, triggers tactile cues in the pilots' collective control. Increased friction on the collective would have been present 7 to 9 seconds into the test and after 11 seconds into the test; however, it is questionable whether the crew would have noticed this increase in friction given the extreme vibration environment. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn summary, although visual and aural warning cues were available to the crew during the event, unambiguous cues for low Nr were most likely unavailable visually because of the vibration and audibly because of a design decision regarding the test environment. Without an unambiguous cue for low Nr, it was unlikely that the pilots had properly distinguishable awareness of the low Nr condition for them to appropriately respond. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExiting OEI Training Mode&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the telemetry data, the crew did not exit OEI training mode; the engines continued producing power at a level consistent with OEI training mode remaining active until the in-flight breakup. The production version of OEI training mode software, originally created by the engine manufacturer, was modified by the helicopter manufacturer to eliminate a safeguard that automatically exited the OEI training mode when Nr fell below 90%. According to the helicopter manufacturer, automatic disengagement at 90% Nr is not low enough to allow development and demonstration of OEI recovery across the flight envelope during testing, and a lower Nr value for automatic disengagement was deemed unnecessary due to the highly controlled test environment. Thus, the crew would have had to manually exit OEI training mode. Had there been an automated safeguard to exit OEI training mode at a certain Nr threshold, it is possible that the return of full dual-engine power would have compensated for the higher power demanded by increasing collective stick inputs and returned Nr to normal levels. Investigators considered several reasons why the crew did not manually exit OEI training mode.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFirst, investigators considered if the crew attempted to exit OEI training mode but was unable to do so due to physical limitations of the hardware. However, postaccident shake tests suggest that the display and touch functionality of the Garmin Touch Control (GTC) panel, which controlled the OEI training mode, remained intact during the vibration profile. Thus, it is unlikely that physical limitations of the hardware itself prevented the crew from exiting OEI training mode. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSecond, investigators considered if the crew attempted to exit OEI training mode but was unable to do so due to manual hand tracking and vibration influences. There are three ways to manually exit OEI training mode: pressing the engine fail button on the GTC OEI training page (which would be displayed on the GTC during the test), exiting the OEI training page on the GTC (using the BACK button), or moving the COSIF (crank, off, start, idle, fly) switch to any other position than \"Fly.\" Research suggests that performance degrades in the presence of vibration and is particularly poor in the 6-Hz range as limb motion can be greater than input amplitudes at that frequency (Moseley and Griffin 1986; Collins 1973; Griffin and Hayward 1994; McLeod and Griffin 1986; Crossland and Lloyd 1993; Holcombe and Holcombe 1997; Wertheim et. al. 1995). Limb motion is also more complex given the coupled dynamics of the human body where acceleration in a single axis could result in limb motion in all six axes (McLeod and Griffin 1986; Griffin 2012; Paddan and Griffin 1988). The extreme amplitudes of the vibration could have prevented the pilots from successfully moving their hands to a target location to use any of these three methods to exit OEI training mode. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFinally, it is possible that the accident crew did not attempt to exit OEI training mode. Test pilot interviews suggest that, in an abnormal situation, stabilizing the aircraft would be the first priority; exiting OEI training mode may not have been considered to be an option by the accident crew. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs noted earlier, the CVFDR was not operational, and possible discussions between the pilots, which may have provided information about why they did not exit OEI training mode, were not available to help determine why they did not exit OEI training mode. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident Actions by the Helicopter Manufacturer&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSince the accident, the helicopter manufacturer has &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    • designed a software filter for the collective control law to dampen biomechanical feedback due to oscillatory control inputs as the frequency of control input increases; \n    • adjusted the aero-servo-elastic model with a correlation factor to incorporate the aerodynamic effects observed during flight test and the accident test to preclude such occurrences seen in the accident flight's telemetry data; \n    • performed shake tests with pilots using a side-stick collective to determine and incorporate the transfer function for human biomechanical feedback; \n    • modified the AHRS software filters to further reduce the AHRS response to a 6-Hz airframe vibration; \n    • indicated that, for the accident helicopter model, cockpit audio is now being recorded by an onboard CVFDR, and communications to and from the ground monitoring station are recorded by the CVFDR and the telemetry system during all flights (cockpit video is also being recorded by the instrumentation system and archived at the ground station); \n    • issued a company-wide business directive to ensure that cockpit audio is recorded during all telemetered flight test activities across all flight test sites; \n    • plans to conduct flight testing in the 95% to 100% range of Nr in an OEI condition; \n    • plans to implement, for the accident helicopter model, the unique low Nr aural tone in their test aircraft, and a software update that includes a larger font size for the Nr numeric display on the PSI;\n    • plans to implement a separate PBA specifically for low Nr and is incorporating more salient cues into the tactile cueing system; \n    • plans to incorporate the automatic termination of OEI training mode should Nr fall below a certain limit; and\n    • incorporated a safety officer for the accident helicopter model test program who will have dedicated safety-related responsibilities.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Development of Biomechanical Filters on Collective&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBiomechanical feedback in the aircraft design industry refers to unintentional control inputs resulting from involuntary pilot limb motions caused by vehicle accelerations. Biomechanical feedback is usually addressed using control friction and control input filtering. The accident helicopter did not have a filter on the collective control to address biomechanical feedback. Bell engineers stated that past experience had never shown a need for filtering the collective control. Filters did exist in the cyclic control to address pitch and roll rates in addition to biomechanical feedback.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBell used a control diagram used for aero-servo-elastic analysis on the Bell 525. Before the accident, the model did not use correlation factors (modeling adjustments based on flight test data), model the main rotor in-plane scissors mode oscillations, or incorporate collective pilot biomechanical feedback in the vertical axis. The pilot model provided gain values in each axis in terms of \"inches of stick per g of acceleration.\" In the cyclic control, the pilot model was developed using experimental data where pilots were shaken laterally on a shake table. This shake-table analysis was done for a side-stick cyclic configuration and a traditional-stick cyclic configuration. Shake-table analysis was never performed on the collective control (traditional stick or side stick) using vertical acceleration. Engineers said that they had never seen negative stability during flight test or in flight when using a pass-through filter for the collective. The control laws engineer for the Bell 525 described that their goal was to manage lag at the 1- to 2-Hz frequency for pilot control. A filter at the higher frequencies could still introduce lag at the lower frequencies. Filters would not be added unless deemed necessary for the high-frequency stability while tuned in order to not decrease margins at low frequencies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen Bell developed feedback filters, control law engineers designed for \"no adverse effects\" on handling qualities. They usually only discussed critical items. The control engineer interviewed did not recall that the vertical axis was deemed critical from a biomechanical feedback standpoint. For the vertical axis, filters were only added if needed, based on flight testing. The control laws engineer said that had they built a pilot model for the collective side stick with a shaker mock up, they could have developed a more accurate transfer function, but they may not have known to add an aerodynamic factor to it for main rotor regressive scissors mode. Even with an aerodynamic model, they would not have been able to validate it without the accident data. He suggested that, for flight testing, they could have tested the lower Nr at low-speed testing and expanded the envelope. This was not something done in the past because previous helicopters could not control Nr as precisely as the 525 since the 525 has fly-by-wire and full authority digital engine control (FADEC) and because it was not required, as this is not a part of the steady operating flight envelope and analysis capabilities did not exist to predict this type of event.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRegarding validating aero-servo-elastic models, Bell had data for steady-state conditions, and the models were 80 to 90% accurate for those dynamics; however, the highly dynamic flight regimes were more difficult to model. They typically modeled those by using steady-state values and adding a correlation/correction vector that was derived from flight test data.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the design phase of the Bell 525, the rotor dynamics group evaluated how the helicopter would perform at different Nr. They expected steady-state, power-off, and transient conditions and limitations. The output of this analysis provided a range of rpms that fed the limitations document used to design the helicopter. The limitations that were generated from the analysis were typically considered draft until they could be verified in flight test.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Nr operating range spanned from the minimum Nr required for lift and the maximum Nr that would overspeed the powerplant. During low airspeed flight, the maximum Nr was defined to be 103% in order to have more energy available in the rotor in the event of a single-engine failure. During high airspeed flight, the maximum Nr was 100%, and the Nr upper limit would transition to this value when flying above a specified airspeed (for example, 55 knots).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight testing was conducted at set points for continuous flight at 103% Nr and 100% Nr, as these are the designed set points for continuous operation within the certified flight envelope. During normal operation, the helicopter's FADEC prevented Nr from drooping below these two set points with all engines operating (as long as power required was not more than the AEO power available). Continuous flight below the Nr set point could only be reached with an OEI or all-engines-inoperative (AEI) condition. The AEI case tested continuous flight down to 90% Nr. No testing of continuous rpms below 100% was conducted in any OEI condition as the maneuvers were expected to be transient in nature.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe OEI maneuver resulted in reduced Nr flight within the green arc on the Nr display. Bell design team members had different understandings of whether it was expected for pilots to fly at lower Nr in the normal operating range (also known as the green arc on the Nr display):&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA performance engineer specified that he expected the normal operating regime for rpm to be where you could fly within these limits continuously.    A control laws engineer considered flying at 185 knots at 90% Nr to be outside of the normal flight envelope. Tolerance would be above or below 5% of normal Nr range.     The design team did not expect to fly outside of this range. Their idea was that for certain maneuvers, it was okay to droop when there were other priorities to test. Their expectation was not to fly at 93% Nr continuously when everything was healthy.    The flight technology specialist at the time of the accident stated that the Nr green arc could mean different things to different people and was often discussed within the team. He considered 90 to 100% Nr to be transient for an AEO condition. The colors presented in the PSI were a precedent from the Bell 429 program.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were also varying understandings of the definition of \"transient.\" One performance engineer considered a 5-second \"sustained rpm\" not to be transient while other engineers considered 30 seconds to be considered steady state. The flight technology team lead said that the definition of transient was different for different people.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTest pilots suggested in postaccident interviews that there could be multiple reasons why a pilot would fly at 92 to 93% when recovering from an OEI maneuver. The chase test pilot stated that flying at 92 and 93% Nr was not necessarily abnormal in an OEI condition. Further, Bell's chief test pilot provided reasons for extended flight in that rpm regime during this maneuver:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIf Nr had stabilized, the pilot may not have been in a rush and could have been initiating a slow recovery that resulted in extended time at 92% Nr.    If the pilot was maneuvering the collective and felt something abnormal, the pilot instinct would be to stop moving the collective in case the abnormality originated from manipulating the collective. This could result in flight at a lower rpm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBell provided examples of three test points in the Bell 429 developmental test program in which pilots remained in the 88 to 96% Nr range for about 20 seconds during the OEI maneuver (between 129 and 135 knots). According to Bell, because the Bell 429 did not encounter any unusual behavior (rotor mode/vibration) during the test points with the extended recovery time, the pilots did not receive negative feedback on the recovery time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHuman Performance Research and References&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nStudies indicate that visual acuity is negatively affected by vertical vibration, particularly in the 5- to 7-Hz frequency range (Lewis and Griffin 1980a; Lewis and Griffin 1980b). Results indicated that reading speed and accuracy degraded for amplitudes as low as 0.1 G (McLeod and Griffin 1989; Griffin and Hayward 1994). Further studies show that visual performance decreases with increasing vibration amplitude (Shoenberger 1972; Griffin 1975; Griffin 2012).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nResearch suggests that performance degrades in the presence of vibration and is particularly poor in the 6-Hz range as limb motion can be greater than input amplitudes at that frequency (Moseley and Griffin 1986; Collins 1973; Griffin and Hayward 1994; McLeod and Griffin 1986; Crossland and Lloyd 1993; Holcombe and Holcombe 1997; Wertheim et. al. 1995).

TNO Human Factors Research Institute, Soesterberg, The Netherlands. - The accident helicopter was a conventional main rotor and tail rotor design (see figure 1). On April 25, 2016, the helicopter received its latest experimental research and development airworthiness certificate from the FAA. The helicopter was a manufacturing prototype being developed for certification as a transport-category helicopter in compliance with 14 CFR Part 29. As part of the airworthiness certificate, the FAA issued an operating limitations document (also dated April 25, 2016) that specified the following: pilots operating the helicopter must hold a temporary LOA issued by an FAA flight standards operations inspector to act as PIC, the helicopter must be maintained by an FAA-approved inspection program, day visual flight rules flight operations are authorized, and all flights must be conducted within the Arlington Initial Experimental Test Area. The helicopter was estimated to weigh about 19,975 lbs at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Accident helicopter (Bell 525, N525TA).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSource: Bell Helicopter&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Bell 525 helicopter had a five-bladed main rotor that provided helicopter lift and thrust and rotated in a counterclockwise direction when viewed from above. The main rotor was a fully articulated system that used elastomeric bearings to accommodate blade feathering, flapping, and lead-lag motions. Fluid-elastic dampers moderated lead-lag motion of the blades. The five main rotor blades were identified by colored stickers, presented in order of advancing rotation (when seated in the pilot seat and observing the blades pass from right to left): blue, orange, red, green, and white. The Bell 525 also had a four-bladed, fully articulated, canted tail rotor that provided thrust to counteract main rotor torque effect, control helicopter yaw, and provide lift. The four tail rotor blades were identified by colored stickers, presented in order of advancing rotation: blue, orange, red, and green. The helicopter was equipped with two General Electric (GE) CT7-2F1 turboshaft engines, mounted aft of the main transmission, and one Honeywell RE100BR auxiliary power unit (APU), mounted between the two engines at the aft end of the engine deck. The helicopter was equipped with a triple-redundant fly-by-wire flight control system with a triplex hydraulic system. Additionally, the helicopter was equipped with retractable tricycle landing gear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit was configured for two pilots in a side-by-side seated position and a center console between them. Each pilot had a cyclic side-stick controller forward of the seat's right armrest, a collective side-stick controller immediately forward of the seat's left arm rest, and a set of pedals forward of their feet. The instrument panel consisted of four identical primary flight display (PFD)/multifunction display (MFD) panels. The center console had two Garmin Touch Control (GTC) panels, the landing gear handle, the Nav/Com panel, and the flight test switch panel, which included some controls for the OEI special training mode software. Directly above the GTCs were the engine control COSIF (crank, off, start, idle, fly) knobs. Each pilot had an additional pilot display unit that provided real-time flight test instrumentation parameters such as DA, boom airspeed, mast airspeed, engine torque, load factor, pitch/yaw/roll rates, slip angle, and main rotor and tail rotor flapping angles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOEI Training Mode&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOEI training mode is a specific GE software-driven capability that permits simulation of a single-engine failure without actually rolling back or shutting down an engine in flight. When the flight crew engages the OEI training mode, both engines reduce power to represent the power available from a single engine. Consistent with normal operations and depending on the flight conditions, if the power demanded by the rotor exceeds the power available, Nr will droop. If single-engine power is insufficient to sustain the forward speed, the pilot must reduce the power demand by lowering the collective control, applying aft cyclic (to reduce speed), or using a combination of both. Nr increases to 103% when the power required matches the single-engine power available.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTo engage OEI training, the pilot or copilot navigates to the OEI training page on the GTC and selects the engine to fail on the touch screen. Once selected, a green bar appears on the failed engine button to signal that OEI training mode was engaged (see figure 2). When OEI training mode is engaged, the pilot's side (right-seat) PFD displays simulated OEI engine values, and the copilot's side (left-seat) PFD displays the actual all-engines-operative (AEO) data.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. OEI training page on the GTC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSource: Bell Helicopter&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe OEI special training mode that Bell used for the accident flight test did not incorporate an automatic disengagement of OEI training mode for low Nr. Bell modified the production version of OEI training mode software, originally created by GE, to eliminate a safeguard that automatically exited the OEI training mode when Nr fell below 90%. According to Bell, automatic disengagement at 90% Nr was not low enough to allow development and demonstration of OEI recovery across the flight envelope during testing, and a lower Nr value for automatic disengagement was deemed unnecessary due to the highly controlled test environment. To manually exit OEI training mode, the pilot could (1) press the engine fail button on the GTC (the same button used to engage OEI training mode), (2) exit the OEI training page on the GTC (using the BACK button), or (3) move the COSIF switch to a position other than \"Fly\" and then return the switch to \"Fly.\" The Bell 525 lead test pilot indicated in a postaccident interview that the options to exit OEI training mode were not discussed formally with all the test pilots but were specifically discussed with the accident test pilot. Bell 525 test pilots interviewed said that they almost always press the engine fail button on the GTC to exit OEI training mode; some Bell pilots were aware of the other methods to exit OEI training mode while other test pilots were not. Disengaging OEI training mode would make both engines available to provide full power to restore the reference Nr to 100% if the rotor was in a drooped state.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe production OEI training mode, which will be used in Bell 525 production helicopters, includes an automatic disengagement of OEI training if Nr decays below 90% (pending validation via testing). In the production OEI training mode, automatic exit would occur in the following circumstances:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n-Loss of an engine.&#x0D;\n-Torques of the two engines are not within ~30 ft-lb of each other.&#x0D;\n-There are any significant engine failures (any fault that would cause local channel degraded on any of the 4 channels). If the enable bit for training is set (bit 20) AND both engine request bits are set (bit 21 and 22). To engage training only one-engine request bit can be set.&#x0D;\n-Power turbine speed (Np) is 5% below the reference value (having previously been within 1% of the reference while in training) or to a value below 90%.&#x0D;\n-Np is above 106%.&#x0D;\n-Real engine gas producer turbine speed is above 106%.&#x0D;\n-Real engine measured gas temperature is above 1934.3° F/ 1056.8° C.&#x0D;\n-Real single-engine torque is above 521 ft-lb (67.7%).&#x0D;\n-Real engine oil temperature is above 148.89° C.&#x0D;\n-Low oil pressure switch is tripped.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOEI training mode flight test risk analysis worksheets documented planned operational risk mitigation for OEI training. A worksheet approved on June 29, 2015, included a discussion of the risk of low Nr, and a worksheet approved on April 1, 2016, included a discussion about engine overtorquing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPower Situation Indicator (PSI)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PSI was located in the bottom left corner of the PFD for each pilot. The bars in the bottom right corner of the PSI represented Np for the number 1 engine, Nr, and Np for the number 2 engine, respectively. The arc in the center of the display depicted the percentage of engine value compared to its limit (see figure 3).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3.

If Nr dropped below 90%, the display changed to an analog needle that displayed a green arc for Nr between 100 and 90%, a yellow arc for Nr between 86 and 89% Nr, and a red arc below 86% Nr (see figure 4). (Overtorquing limits appear above 100%.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. PSI displaying Nr as an arc.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSource: Bell Helicopter&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe CAS was located in the middle right side of the PFD and displayed color-coded messages for status, advisory, caution, and warning alerts (see figure 5). The Bell 525 lead test pilot described warnings as items that need immediate attention and cautions as items that will need attention but not immediately. (Warnings were displayed as white text on red background, cautions were displayed as yellow text on black background, advisories were displayed as white text on black background, and status messages were displayed as green text on black background.) When warnings and caution alerts were triggered, the displayed messages would flash until either the cockpit master warning/caution push button annunciator (PBA) was pressed, the bezel button on the lower right corner of the PFD was pressed, or the triggered condition was inactive for more than 5 seconds. In addition, a caution/warning flag would appear in the lower right corner of the PFD, and a caution/warning light would illuminate on the PBA. For the accident helicopter, if Nr dropped below 90% (in AEO or OEI), a \"ROTOR RPM LO\" warning-level message appeared (see figure 6). Once the condition cleared, the message would immediately disappear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5. Location of visual CAS information available to crew.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSource: Bell Helicopter (modified by the National Transportation Safety Board)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 6. Example of PFD during \"ROTOR RPM LO\" warning.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSource: Bell Helicopter&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn aural tone also annunciated with a CAS alert. The technical requirements specification indicated that the caution audio tone would be a \"ping\" decaying over 0.5 second that sounded when each caution or warning message activated, the warning audio tone would be three \"pings,\" and the low rotor rpm tone would be a unique continuous low/high/low warble to be played continuously as long as the condition existed or until muted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the accident helicopter, the aural tone annunciated for \"ROTOR RPM LO\" was a master warning tone that was not unique to low Nr and was associated with at least 21 other warning messages. The Bell 525 lead test pilot indicated that, during the experimental flight test, many of the aural messages were still under development; the tones had been selected but not implemented. The test team determined that having some aural indication for low Nr was sufficient for development flight testing. He stated that the accident crew had flown OEI tests previously and had conducted autorotation testing with test conditions that would likely have triggered the low Nr warning. He also stated that the crew was likely exposed to the master warning for low Nr during flight testing and in the Relentless Advanced Systems Integration Laboratory (RASIL). (More information about the RASIL can be found in the Organizational and Management Information section.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe chief pilot of the Bell test program stated that, without information from the PFD, he would rely on rotor aural cues to gauge rotor speed. The Bell 525 lead test pilot stated that, lacking any instrument indication, pilots could usually determine rotor speed (high or low) by the sound: specifically, they could hear an engine winding down or sense higher vibrations at higher airspeeds. The Bell 525 lead test pilot further indicated that, under normal conditions, pilots can hear the decrease in Nr and would be able to tell the difference between 100% and 92% Nr but given the vibration environment during the accident flight, it is uncertain whether the pilots would have heard the low Nr.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSummary of Low Nr Indications for the Accident Flight Crew&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTable 2. Indications to the accident flight crew regarding low Nr during the event profile.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  &#x0D;\nMaintenance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the experimental ground and flight testing of the accident helicopter, discrepancies and anomalies were recorded, prioritized, and tracked. Aircraft systems interim procedures (ASIP) provided instructions for periodic or on-condition inspection and/or maintenance. Inspection tasks, including those required by ASIPs and experimental engineering orders, were logged into a database with comments, including inspection results. Recent maintenance performed on the accident helicopter before the accident flight included the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n-A nondestructive inspection and tap test of all four tail rotor blades (no damage noted).&#x0D;\n-A detailed visual inspection of the tail rotor hub (no damage noted). &#x0D;\n-A torque check of the pylon beam attaching hardware (no movement of the attaching hardware noted).&#x0D;\n-A recurrent inspection of airframe longerons required by an ASIP (no anomalous findings reported). - The accident helicopter was equipped to carry a pilot and copilot with no passengers and was not required to be equipped with either a flight data recorder (FDR) or cockpit voice recorder (CVR) under the provisions of 14 CFR 91.609. A combination CVR and FDR (CVFDR) was installed but was not operational at the time of the accident. (When certified as a transport-category rotorcraft under 14 CFR Part 29, the Bell 525 will be equipped with both CVR and FDR recording capabilities.) The accident helicopter was heavily instrumented with several aircraft- and ground-based recording systems, both production and flight-test based, including a streaming telemetry system, helicopter monitoring unit (HMU), avionics recorders, and PFD/MFD recording capability.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) received the following components with flight data recording and storage capabilities: Simmonds Precision Products Vigor HMU (serial number [S/N] 0006); CVFDR (S/N 009-01029); 128 gigabyte (GB) solid-state drive (SSD) from aircraft high-speed avionics bus (S/N TW-032GYJ-55085); 4 SD memory cards (S/N unknown); and Zodiac Aerospace remote storage module (RSM) 128 GB (S/N 052405-112012). Regarding the HMU and 4 SD memory cards, all the data was available from other sources. Regarding the CVFDR, the data download file was determined to be blank; the FDR may not have been receiving data or been fully configured in the helicopter. Regarding the SSD, due to the extent of the damage, no data could be recovered. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nZodiac Aerospace RSM 128 GB &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Zodiac Aerospace RSM, the data storage medium of the flight test recorder system installed on N525TA, is a solid-state hard drive with 128 GB capacity and an integrated E-SATA download interface. The data recorded on this drive, which was typically downloaded after each test flight, was the primary data source for Bell's flight test analysis team and was sourced from the following sensors and aircraft systems:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight test strain gauges in the fuselage, main rotor, tail rotor, engine, and engine mounts.    Production accelerometers in the drive system, rotors, and engine/APU.    Flight controls data bus including ARINC-429/1553/RS-232/RS-485.    Hydraulic system temperatures, pressures, and flows.    Production and flight test air data systems, including temperatures and pressures.    Both engines, all engine control channels of temperatures, pressures, speeds, gearboxes, and shafts.    Flight test temperature readings in the aircraft skin.    Avionics and flight displays systems.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe data stream recorded by the RSM was also transmitted via a telemetry stream to a ground station at Bell's flight-test facility for real-time analysis and recording.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe RSM, which was ejected from the helicopter during the crash sequence and was found apart from the main wreckage, was in good condition, with no apparent impact or thermal damage. Bell extracted the data under the NTSB's supervision. The RSM recording contained about 1 hour 26 minutes of data, including preflight and flight activities; the event flight was the only flight recorded on the drive. Once processed, the data was segregated into \"prime\" data (data taken during a test) and \"non-prime\" data (data taken at all other times). There were 41 periods of prime data in the recording, including the period up to and including the end of the recording. The RSM engine data showed that the engines were operating as commanded throughout the flight. (More information about test 51 can be found in the Tests and Research section.) - On July 6, 2016, about 1148 central daylight time, an experimental research and development Bell 525 helicopter, N525TA, broke up in flight and impacted terrain near Italy, Texas. The two test pilots received fatal injuries, and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter, which was owned by Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc., was being operated under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a developmental flight test. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight originated from Arlington Municipal Airport, Arlington, Texas.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 0630 on the morning of the accident, the two test pilots, flight test engineers, and a chase helicopter flight crew briefed the planned flight. The brief detailed that the accident helicopter, accompanied by a chase helicopter, would proceed to the Arlington Initial Experimental Test Area (about 30 miles south of Arlington Municipal Airport) to perform the in-flight portion of the tests. The purpose of the flight was to evaluate engine loads at maximum continuous power, two-to-one-engine simulated engine failures, longitudinal roll oscillations, and run-on landings in the heavy, forward center-of-gravity configuration.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe test card for the two-to-one-engine simulated engine failure detailed that the pilots would simulate the loss of engine power from one engine while keeping both engines operating by using one-engine-inoperative (OEI) special training mode software, which reduced the power output of both engines to represent the maximum power that can be produced by one engine. When the OEI special training mode was engaged and a loss of power was simulated, the pilot would monitor rotor rotation speed (Nr) and intentionally delay his response by about 1 second before recovering from the maneuver by lowering the collective to reduce the power demanded by the rotor (and increase Nr). The lowest allowable Nr limit was identified as 86%; if Nr went below 86%, the test would be halted, and the crew would recover Nr to 103%, exit OEI special training mode, and return to steady level flight. A Bell structural engineer stated that flight below 86% Nr would result in the helicopter returning to base. During test flights, flight test engineers monitor real-time telemetry data from the helicopter under the oversight of the flight test director, who was in direct radio communications with both the test helicopter pilots and the chase helicopter pilots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 0959, weather conditions were determined to be acceptable for the flight, and about 1038, the helicopter departed for the test area, followed by the chase helicopter. About 1048, the pilots established the helicopter's maximum level flight airspeed (Vh) at 4,000 ft density altitude (DA) as 148 knots calibrated airspeed (KCAS). After performing steady-heading sideslips, the pilots performed a series of level turns and then began the two-to-one-engine simulated engine failures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1108, the pilots set the OEI training mode shaft horsepower to a value predetermined by the flight engineers. The first three tests were performed in level flight at 102 KCAS, 131 KCAS, and 145 KCAS. The pilots then performed tests at 155 knots true airspeed (KTAS), 160 KTAS, 165 KTAS, and 175 KTAS, which required the helicopter to be in a shallow descent to achieve the required airspeed. These OEI tests had resulted in a rotor speed decay of 5 to 13% Nr. During these tests, to allow Nr to recover to 97% or greater, the crew lowered the collective input to near or below 50%. (100% is the full-up collective position, and 0% is the full-down collective position.) Data recorded on the helicopter's flight test recorder system, which was typically downloaded after each test flight and also transmitted via a telemetry stream to Bell's flight-test facility for real-time analysis and recording, indicate the build-up tests and recovery time required (see table 1). (Record 45 was a void record, and record 49 was aborted because of two engine torque spikes typical of wind gust encounters.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTable 1. Build-up tests and recovery time required.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the build up to the final test, the flight test engineers received warning and alert notifications, most of which related to main rotor and tail rotor pitch link loads, pylon loads, and tail boom loads. These alerts and warnings were expected as the airspeed increased and the dynamic loads on the rotor system and airframe also increased. During most of the OEI transitions, the pilot responded by lowering the collective between 1 and 2 seconds after the simulated loss of engine power. However, with each increase in airspeed, the time the crew took to recover Nr to the target value of 103% was longer. Bell test pilots indicated that they interpreted this trend as the tendency of the crew to be more judicious while applying collective at successively higher airspeeds in order to avoid recovering too fast and overspeeding the rotor or damaging the transmission.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1148, the final test was performed at 185 KTAS, which was the helicopter's never-to-exceed speed (Vne) at the time of the test flight; the set up and entry were the same as the previous tests. OEI was engaged, and Nr drooped to about 91% within 1.5 seconds. The Nr decay was stopped by the pilot's reduction of collective, and Nr began to recover and leveled out around 92%. The crew stopped lowering the collective at the 58% collective stick position. About 7 seconds after arresting the Nr decay (about 12 seconds into the test), the structural dynamics engineer noticed increased engine vibrations, at which point he called \"knock-it-off.\" The test director radioed to the Bell 525 pilots to \"knock-it-off,\" while other engineers in the telemetry room were receiving warnings and alerts and were reinforcing the \"knock-it-off\" call.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe crew of the chase helicopter, which was positioned about 100 ft above and on the right side of the Bell 525 about 3 to 4 rotor diameters away, heard the test director call \"knock-it-off\" about the same time they observed the 525's rotor blades flying high and the rotor looking wobbly and slow. The chase helicopter crew radioed, \"Hey, you're flapping pretty good,\" but the 525 pilots did not respond. About 21 seconds into the test, the main rotor severed the tail boom, and the telemetry signal was lost. The chase helicopter crew observed the helicopter's tail and fuselage jack-knife and debris separate from the helicopter. The chase helicopter crew radioed to the test director, \"We've had a major accident,\" and landed near the wreckage to attempt assistance. - The Office of the Medical Examiner for the county of Dallas, Texas, performed an autopsy on the pilot and determined that the cause of death was thermal and blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory performed toxicology testing on specimens from the pilot. The specimens were noted as being putrefied; tests for carbon monoxide and cyanide were not performed, ethanol was detected in muscle, no ethanol was detected in the brain, and none of the listed drugs in the toxicology report were detected in the liver specimen.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Office of the Medical Examiner for the county of Dallas, Texas, performed an autopsy on the copilot and determined that the cause of death was blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory performed toxicology testing on specimens from the copilot. The specimens were noted as being putrefied; tests for carbon monoxide and cyanide were not performed, ethanol was detected in muscle, no ethanol was detected in the liver, propanol was detected in muscle, and none of the listed drugs in the toxicology report were detected in lung or liver specimens. - Arlington Municipal Airport is located 31 miles north-northwest of the accident site. The Arlington automated surface observation system (elevation 628 ft mean sea level [msl]) recorded observation for 1145 was wind from 170° at 15 knots, 10 miles visibility, sky clear of clouds, temperature 32°C, dew point 23°C, and altimeter of 29.95 in Mercury (Hg).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHillsboro Municipal Airport is located 15 miles south-southwest of the accident site. The Hillsboro automated weather observation system (elevation 686 ft msl) recorded observation for 1136 was wind from 190° at 16 knots with gusts to 22 knots, 10 miles visibility, scattered clouds at 3,000 ft, temperature 31°C, dew point 23°C, and altimeter at 29.98 in Hg. - The Bell 525 program consisted of the conceptual design phase, preliminary design review, critical design review, flight readiness review (FRR), developmental flight testing, and certification flight testing. Investigators interviewed Bell design and test engineers who described the pace of the Bell 525 program at the time of the accident as fast but not unreasonably so. Personnel described specific pressure felt during the time of the first flight test in Amarillo, Texas, in mid-2015. When personnel were supporting the first flight, they commonly worked 7 days per week and logged between 60 and 70 hours of work per week. Many described morale to be low during the first flight. Once the flight test program moved back to Arlington, Texas, in September 2015, the pace slowed, and many reported improved morale. Original certification for the Bell 525 was scheduled for mid-2016, but the program faced various setbacks during initial design. Most engineers interviewed stated that they had not received undue pressure from management to complete tasks. No monetary incentives (outside of overtime pay) were provided to employees, and employees were not concerned about negative consequences when raising concerns. Employees described Bell's safety culture as \"good.\" At the time of the accident, design and test engineers reported working about 10 hours of overtime per week on average.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe chief engineer for the Bell 525 program was responsible for all 525 testing, certification activity, and structures (drive, rotor, and airframe). Six discipline areas reported to the chief engineer: airframe engineering, systems engineering and certification, rotors engineering and component test, drive systems, flight technology, and flight test/experimental test and evaluation. The 525 program flight test integrated product team (IPT) consisted of 12 flight test engineers and 3 instrumentation engineers. Six of the 12 flight test pilots in Bell's experimental test and evaluation department were assigned to support the 525 program. The chief engineer worked closely with the air vehicle IPT; the air vehicle lead was responsible for flight control system and software, control laws, avionics, electrical system, propulsion, hydraulic system, fuel system, and environmental controls.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a Bell avionics engineer, before the FRR, the avionics group developed a spreadsheet of all the CAS functions and whether they were designated as critical or not critical for flight safety; they tested the safety-of-flight functions using scripts or a CAS manual test. The results for each function were \"passed,\" \"passed with exception,\" \"failed,\" or \"safe.\" A \"failed\" state indicated that the alert did not annunciate or annunciate in time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Bell 525 lead test pilot, if no pilot action was required, then the alert would be an advisory or would only be available on the maintenance page. If pilot action was required, they referred to the following CAS philosophy: for anything requiring pilot action immediately, it was a warning; if it required action, but not immediately, it would be a caution; or, if action was required much later, it would be advisory information. The Bell 525 lead test pilot described the difference between caution and advisory as a gray area. \"Safety critical\" referred to messages for which if nothing was done, it would \"break the helicopter, or cause the helicopter not to be flown right, or it would exceed a limit.\" All the warnings counted as safety critical, as did some cautions. He stated that the decision for what was critical came from the cockpit working group, which worked with other systems groups, pilots, a safety representative, and the individual who conducted design safety analysis, and all the decisions were documented. The cockpit working group created the list of safety-critical items. The list was then vetted and sent to the avionics group for implementation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Bell Helicopter, test pilot duties included planning and conducting experimental flight tests in helicopters and tiltrotor aircraft; conducting other flight test operations; maintaining flight currency and traveling in support of Bell Helicopter flight operations; completing flight analysis and flight evaluations of aircraft, test planning, and flight test reports; planning and executing engineering and experimental test flights of new aircraft and/or systems; evaluating and reporting on data gathered during test flights; demonstrating safe and efficient test planning and execution; interfacing with the project team to ensure successful accomplishment of the test program; and making recommendations regarding operational effectiveness of systems, aircraft handling qualities, and design improvements.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn December 2015, the flight test group had put in place a personal risk assessment tool that each pilot could complete before flying. Pilots were encouraged to fill out the risk assessment every day; it was not mandatory. The accident pilots did not have a risk assessment on file for the day of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe majority of pilot training consisted of time in the RASIL engineering simulator, which is an accurate engineering representation of the cockpit, including control feel, and visual in-flight representation projected on a screen that wrapped around the cockpit. Next to the RASIL cockpit was a separate \"Rig Room\" containing actual flight hardware (hydraulic servos) rigged to apply flight loads into engineering representations of related hardware. When a control was moved in the RASIL cockpit, hardware would respond to the command in the Rig Room. Pilots assigned to the 525 program would routinely operate the RASIL while developing flight procedures, validating software changes, and reviewing fight test plans.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough there were no written logs showing when a pilot or flight crew worked in the RASIL, the Bell chief test pilot believed the accident flight crew had reviewed the test card for the mishap flight in the RASIL, and the RASIL engineers stated that the accident flight crew routinely worked in the RASIL. Typical training flow would involve two RASIL sessions for each test flight. If the pilots had been in the RASIL within 2 weeks of a test flight, they were considered current.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, both the pilot and copilot had accumulated many ground testing hours validating the OEI training mode in the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo pilots from the flight test group were scheduled as the chase aircrew flying a Bell 429 helicopter. The duties of the chase helicopter included monitoring the test area for other aircraft, monitoring the flight for safety issues, and observing and monitoring the test helicopter as it executed the test card.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe chase helicopter was in radio communications with the test helicopter and the test director. After a few circuits of the traffic pattern, the chase helicopter positioned itself behind the test helicopter, and they departed to the test area as a flight of two. Once in the test area, at the higher test airspeeds, the chase helicopter would fall farther behind the test helicopter because of its airspeed limitations but would rejoin the test helicopter as it slowed and recovered from the maneuver. The chase helicopter crew reported seeing no distractions or abnormalities outside of the accident helicopter. - The pilot held a letter of authorization (LOA) from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) dated December 2, 2015, authorizing him to act as pilot-in-command (PIC) of the Bell experimental helicopter designated model 525. He completed crew resource management (CRM) training on January 12, 2015. The pilot graduated from the United States Naval Test Pilot School (USNTPS) in 2010. He then worked on numerous flight test projects involving the Bell AH-1W (SuperCobra, a twin-engine attack helicopter) and UH-1Y (Venom/Super Huey, a twin-engine utility helicopter). On September 23, 2013, he was hired by the Bell Helicopter flight test department as a pilot for the Bell 525 program.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe copilot held an LOA from the FAA dated December 2, 2015, authorizing him to act as PIC of the Bell experimental helicopter designated model 525. He completed CRM training on January 12, 2015. The copilot completed US Navy flight training in 2000 and graduated from the USNTPS in 2006. He then worked on numerous AH-1W and UH-1Y test programs. On August 2, 2010, he was hired by the Bell Helicopter flight test department as a pilot for the Bell 525 program. - The helicopter's flight telemetry system recorded flight data on the aircraft and streamed it to the test crew monitoring the flight from the ground. The lowest data collection rate was 31.25 hertz (Hz) and the highest was 4,000 Hz. Data was recorded continuously throughout the test and then divided into identifying records for each test point performed. When the pilot initiated a new test, the test timer started from zero. The helicopter was on test 51 (which ran for 21.18 seconds) when the accident occurred, indicating it was the 51st flight test point on the day of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor the Vne of 185 knots, a single engine is insufficient to maintain the flight condition; management of Nr is critical to recovering from the loss of an engine. Pilot response at high speed is to lower the collective to reduce torque on the rotor and/or to pull the longitudinal cyclic back to reduce the airspeed; both actions result in reducing the power required by the main rotor and allowing Nr to recover. Once rotor speed has recovered to the target value of 103% Nr, the test would be considered complete.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn two prior successful OEI tests at 175 knots airspeed (record 50) and 165 knots airspeed (record 48), Nr decayed from 100% within about 3.5 to 4 seconds, consistent with initiation of the OEI test. Collective was reduced to 51% for test 50 and 43% for test 48. Nr stopped decreasing around 90% before recovering to 97% for test 50 and nearly 100% for test 48. The time from Nr decay to initial Nr recovery for both tests was between 2 and 3 seconds (see figure 9).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 9. Plot comparing tests 48, 50, and 51.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor test 51, Nr began to decay about 3.5 seconds after test initiation, similar to the prior tests. Collective was reduced to 58%, and Nr stabilized near 92% but did not return to 97% or higher as in the previous tests. After 6 seconds, a vibration near 6 Hz was seen in the collective and longitudinal cyclic inputs that was not present in the earlier tests. After 7 seconds, Nr stopped recovering. When collective was increased between 10 and 13 seconds and again between 16 and 17.5 seconds, Nr slowed, and, by 18 seconds, it had decreased to below 80%. After 10 seconds, cyclic input activity increased, as did the roll response. The helicopter's roll and pitch responded to cyclic input throughout the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe red main rotor blade was instrumented to record blade flapping; as Nr decreased after 16 seconds, the out-of-plane flapping motion increased. At 20.4 seconds, the string potentiometer that measured blade flapping motion stopped functioning due to excessive flapping. At 20.7 seconds, a large aft cyclic input reached peak value. Within two rotations of losing the flapping signal, one or more of the main rotor blades severed the tail boom from the aircraft, and all data recording and telemetry ended.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs noted above, an oscillation occurred in the collective and cyclic control inputs during the accident test sometime after 6 seconds; the oscillation was not present during the previous test records and indicated a vibration in the structure and controls near 6 Hz. This vibration was not a single mode of vibration at exactly 6 Hz throughout the flight; the frequency of the vibration changed slightly through the test as rotor speed changed and various airframe and rotor modes were excited. This 6-Hz vibration was distinctive, grew in amplitude, and affected the entire helicopter and the flight crew.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter 7 seconds, the vibration was well defined, and the amplitude began to grow. At 10 seconds, the amplitude grew before decaying again after 12 seconds. (This growth was described as a \"blossom\" in the vibration.) The appearance of the 6-Hz oscillation corresponded with an Nr of about 92%. As Nr stayed near 92%, the 6-Hz vibration grew in amplitude from around 7 seconds until 11 seconds. At 11 seconds, Nr slowed below 90%, and the 6-Hz amplitude decreased. At 13.5 seconds, Nr began to increase from 86%, and as Nr again approached 92%, the 6-Hz amplitude increased. The amplitude of the vertical acceleration was near ± 2.5 G at 6 Hz around 11 seconds and again after 16 seconds. (G is a unit of measurement of acceleration; 1 G is equivalent to the acceleration caused by the earth's gravity [about 32.2 ft/sec2].) For comparison, earlier test records showed variations in vertical acceleration no greater than ± 0.3 G. The 6-Hz vibration appeared in the control inputs, especially the collective, starting before 7 seconds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe investigation focused on the source of the 6-Hz vibration. The lead-lag (in-plane) motion of a rotating rotor system can produce frequencies in the fixed (nonrotating) system (the frequency at which the rotor system conveys motion into the fixed system). The investigation focused on two significant in-plane rotor modes: the cyclic regressing mode and the scissors mode. (A cyclic mode occurs when rotor blades lead and lag in such a way that the hub of the rotor begins to orbit about its axis of rotation. The mode is regressing if the time it takes the hub to make one full cycle is slower than one full rotation of the blades around the hub. For the scissors mode, the lead-lag motions of the blades act in such a way that adjacent blades move together and apart in a scissoring motion. In forward flight, the scissors mode produces a fore-aft motion of the main rotor mast due to aerodynamic forces.) The fixed-system frequency of the main rotor cyclic regressing mode is 2.6 Hz at 100% Nr and drops to 2.4 Hz at 92% Nr. The fixed-system frequency of the main rotor scissors mode is 6.8 Hz at 100% Nr and drops to 6.2 Hz at 92% Nr. The fixed-system frequency of the tail rotor cyclic regressing mode is 6.6 Hz at 100% Nr and 5.4 Hz at 92% Nr.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the accident test, the main rotor scissors mode was excited, unexpectedly, at a lower frequency in the fixed system due to the lower Nr. Initially, as Nr was between 100% and 93%, the tail rotor primarily exhibited cyclic regressing in-plane motion, and the pilot-seat vertical vibration frequency followed that frequency. The amplitude of this response was less than 0.2 Gs and consistent with prior tests. At the start of the accident test, the main rotor primarily exhibited cyclic regressing in-plane motion, which was expected. At 92%, the tail rotor in-plane cyclic regressing mode and the first vertical bending mode of the helicopter coalesced near 5.4 Hz. (The first vertical bending mode is the lowest frequency mode at which the aircraft fuselage oscillates about its lateral axis [both nose and tail flex up, then both nose and tail flex down relative to the center portion of the fuselage].) As Nr decreased toward 92%, the primary main rotor in-plane motion shifted from cyclic regressing to scissors. Around 92%, the main rotor scissors in-plane motion was near 6 Hz, and, by 6.5 seconds, the pilot-seat vertical acceleration responded at the main rotor scissors mode frequency, indicating that the fuselage of the aircraft was responding to the scissors mode. The main rotor's shift to the scissors mode produced a frequency around 6 Hz that began dominating the vibratory signature of the tail rotor and the fuselage and, by 7 seconds, had affected the controls.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFrom 5 to 11 seconds, Nr stayed between 90% and 93%, and the amplitude of the pilot-seat vertical acceleration increased markedly from less than ± 0.1 G to greater than ± 1 G. After 12 seconds, a collective control increase resulted in a further reduction in Nr, which coincided with a reduction in the pilot-seat vibration about the 14-second mark. As the test continued, the amplitude of the vibration grew again in all channels where it was present.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo sources were determined to have increased the amplitude of the helicopter's 6-Hz frequency response:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBiomechanical feedback into the collective control    Cyclic stir in the swashplate driven by the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDetermining the separate contributions of the biomechanical feedback and the AHRS to the increase in amplitude was not possible with the flight data. The evidence for biomechanical feedback is seen in the trace of pilot collective control after 6.5 seconds, which shows the pilot's control stick moving at the 6-Hz frequency. The pilot's collective control oscillations result in further amplification of the main rotor scissors mode, further amplifying the vertical seat vibration and increasing the collective stick oscillation. Since the collective was being physically cycled at 6 Hz, the control laws would send a corresponding (6-Hz) command to the tail rotor as antitorque compensation. The biomechanical feedback loop appears to attenuate after 10 seconds (and again at 16 seconds as seen by reductions in the pilot-seat vertical vibration and collective control oscillation at those times).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the accident flight, excitation of the airframe's first bending modes (lateral and vertical) induced the AHRS to respond with inputs intended to stabilize the aircraft. The AHRS was intended to work with the control laws as though the fuselage was a rigid body responding to wind gusts or similar low-frequency inputs and was not intended for handling a 6-Hz vibration. Although the AHRS included filters on the signal outputs, the filters did not specifically target the 6-Hz stirring commands to the swashplate. The stirring actions of the AHRS system at this (~6 Hz) frequency were considered to be a driver of the scissors mode amplification of the main rotor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor scissors mode had been encountered at 100% Nr (and produced a 6.7-Hz vibration) in two previous tests at lower airspeed but in high load-factor banked turns, where the rotor blades are highly loaded. Specifically, in the previous tests, when Nr was 100%, the scissors mode was at 6.8 Hz as expected. The tests were at a lower airspeed (145 to 152 knots) but included high blade loading due to increased load factor in a banked turn. In both tests, the vibration quickly damped out as the blade loading was reduced. Previous experience demonstrated that the scissors mode was well damped at 100% Nr. The high forward speed of the accident test produced a similar highly loaded aerodynamic environment for the rotor blades. One aspect of the main rotor's aerodynamic environment can be described by examining the aircraft's advance ratio (true airspeed/blade tip speed) in relation to the blade loading. High blade loading and high advance ratios produce a more complex aerodynamic environment. In all tests, the scissors mode response was only encountered on the outer edge of the blade-loading/advance ratio environment and indicate that a complex aerodynamic environment was needed to excite this response.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhile the scissors mode was quickly damped out in the earlier tests, it grew in amplitude during the accident test record until the whole aircraft was vibrating at that frequency. The lower frequency of the scissors mode during the accident test due to the reduced Nr allowed biomechanical feedback into the controls, and the response of the AHRS system through the control laws increased the amplitude of the scissors mode response. The manufacturer will focus on mitigating the biomechanical feedback and the AHRS-induced swashplate stirring via control law filtering to prevent the amplification of the scissors mode response.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe vibration loads experienced during the accident test were outside the parameters for certification testing for the Garmin PFD and GTC displays. Because of the criticality of the PFD and GTC for flight information, a postaccident test was conducted to observe the performance of these displays when exposed to unusually high vibration loads. The displays were mounted onto a shake table, and a vibration profile similar to the accident was applied to the hardware. The GTC and PFD functioned normally throughout the entire test, and no faults were recorded. Displays presented information continuously with no distortion or screen blanking, and touch functionality on the GTC and bezel button functionality on the PFD functioned properly. - The main wreckage field was 2,200 ft from the last transmitted GPS point, along the flightpath heading of 320°. The main wreckage site included an impact crater, remnants of the main fuselage, cockpit, main transmission and main rotor hub, two of the five main rotor blades (blue and green), the forward portion of the tail boom, and both engines. There was evidence of a postcrash fire at the main wreckage site. The wreckage debris path at the main wreckage site was about 200 ft in length and was oriented about 315° magnetic.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe secondary wreckage site was about 1,300 ft southeast of the main wreckage site and comprised the aft portion of the tail boom, which contained the tail rotor drive system, intermediate gearbox, tail rotor gearbox (TRGB), and tail rotor. A debris field extended between the last data point and the main wreckage covering about 4,000 ft (north to south) by 1,700 ft (east to west). Three of the five main rotor blades (orange, white, and red) and various pieces of forward cowlings, cockpit frames, and cabin doors were found separate from the main and secondary wreckage sites in the debris field. Additionally, lightweight debris, such as insulation and main rotor blade skin pieces, was found scattered to the northeast of the debris path between the main and secondary wreckage sites, with the farthest piece being found about 1,520 ft away from the debris path between the main and secondary wreckage sites (see figure 7). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 7. The location of the main wreckage site, secondary wreckage site, and selected items from the wreckage debris field.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main fuselage was highly fragmented and exhibited evidence of thermal damage. The cockpit wreckage did not sustain significant thermal damage. Fractured pieces of the cyclic and collective side sticks were observed within the cockpit wreckage. The lateral push-pull tubes were retained in the cockpit wreckage but exhibited fractures consistent with overload. Both engines remained installed on the engine deck and exhibited thermal distress from exposure to the postcrash fire. The forward portion of the tail boom exhibited an angled fracture line at its aft end consistent with main rotor blade contact. The tail boom attachment points to the main fuselage exhibited fractures near the upper left corner and lower right corner. The aft portion of the tail boom was found resting partially inverted, with the tail rotor head and one tail rotor blade wholly embedded into the ground and exhibited an angled cut line at its forward end consistent with main rotor blade contact (see figure 8).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 8. Angled cut line at the forward end of the aft section of the tail boom.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSource: GE Aviation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub remained attached to the main rotor shaft. The inboard end of the blue main rotor blade exhibited evidence of thermal damage, and the root end of the blade airfoil remained attached to its respective grip assembly via three blade retention bolts. A 14-ft-long inboard section of the orange main rotor blade was found about 1,140 ft southeast of the main wreckage site with its inboard end embedded in the ground and its outboard end embedded in tree branches; the remainder of the blade was found about 2,880 ft southeast of the main wreckage site. Yellowish-orange paint transfer marks (similar in color to the primer found on portions of the airframe) were observed on the leading-edge surfaces in the area where the blade fractured into two distinct pieces, and additional orange paint transfer marks were observed on the leading-edge surfaces. Gouge marks into the lower blade surface and damage to the blade afterbody were observed. The red main rotor blade was found embedded in a tree about 1,400 ft southeast of the main wreckage site; impact marks on the leading edge, a fracture on the spar, and a chordwise gouge on the lower surface of the blade were observed. An inboard section of the green main rotor blade was recovered adjacent to the main transmission at the main wreckage site, and a 9-ft-long outboard section of the blade was found in a tree canopy about 1,325 ft southeast of the main wreckage site. The white main rotor blade was found on the ground about 350 ft southeast of the main wreckage site; the upper and lower grips were both fractured, while the blade airfoil remained attached. The blade leading-edge abrasion strip exhibited impact marks that included orange and yellow paint transfer marks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor head remained attached to the TRGB and exhibited no evidence of cracks or fractures. The blue tail rotor blade leading edge was partially embedded into the ground; a small puncture was observed on the outboard surface. The orange tail rotor blade leading-edge tip was found embedded into the bottom-left edge of the tail cone; the orange tail rotor blade tip end afterbody exhibited a mid-chord fracture extending about 10 inches inboard. The red tail rotor blade trailing edge was partially embedded into the ground. The green tail rotor blade was wholly embedded into the ground; removal of the tail rotor revealed the blade airfoil had partially folded over immediately outboard of the grip attachment. Three of the four tail rotor dampers remained intact and were able to be bench tested; the fourth tail rotor damper separated into two halves and could not be bench tested. Dynamic bench testing of the three tail rotor dampers did not reveal evidence of anomalous response behavior. -",

There were no witnesses to the accident, no recorded radar data, and no recorded radio transmissions from the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preexisting anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. There was evidence that a mast bumping event had occurred and that the main rotor blades had contacted the airframe, which resulted in an in-flight break-up. There was no recorded information available that could be used to determine the helicopter's airspeed, altitude, or the pilot's control inputs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA weather study indicated that conditions were conducive to the development of significant updrafts or thermals of rising air and dust devils, and people near the accident site reported that there were numerous dust devils in the area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt is likely that the helicopter encountered turbulence due to updrafts and/or dust devils, and the pilot lost control of the helicopter, which resulted in mast bumping.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Robinson Safety Notice SN-32 discusses flight in high winds and turbulence and explains how improper application of control inputs in response to turbulence can increase the likelihood of a mast bumping accident. It recommends that pilots reduce airspeed below normal cruise speed to 60 to 70 knots for flight in significant turbulence. It suggests techniques to avoid overcontrol of the helicopter, and says to avoid flying on the downwind side of hills and ridges. - On June 23, 2016, about 1425 mountain standard time, a Robinson Helicopter Company R66, N117TW, broke up in flight near Wikieup, Arizona. The commercial pilot and the pilot-rated passenger sustained fatal injuries; the helicopter was destroyed. Guidance Air Service LLC was operating the helicopter under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The cross-country positioning flight departed Prescott, Arizona, about 1338 with a planned destination of Riverside, California. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the pilot, who was seated in the right seat, was going to Riverside to take a Part 135.293 check ride with an inspector from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Flight Standards District Office located there. The pilot-rated passenger, who was seated in the left seat, was the operator's Part 141 chief pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was reported overdue when it did not arrive at the destination, and the wreckage was located about 0430 on June 24. There were no witnesses to the accident, no recorded radar data, and no recorded radio transmissions from the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA SPOT device, which is a handheld GPS tracking device that uses a satellite network enabling text messaging and GPS tracking services, was present on the helicopter. Records provided by the operator listed 19 location fixes beginning at Prescott at 1338 and proceeding on a southwesterly heading. The last data point at 1425 was in the vicinity of the accident site. - Pilot&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Mohave County Medical Examiner's Office completed an external exam autopsy of the pilot. The cause of death was determined to be multiple injuries due to a helicopter crash.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing of the specimens from the pilot by the FAA's Bioaeronautical Science's Research Laboratory, Oklahoma, City, Oklahoma, were negative for ethanol and tested drugs in the muscle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot-Rated Passenger&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Mohave County Medical Examiner's Office completed an autopsy of the pilot-rated passenger. The cause of death was determined to be multiple injuries due to a helicopter crash.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing of the specimens from the pilot-rated passenger by the FAA's Bioaeronautical Science's Research Laboratory were negative for tested drugs in the liver.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe testing detected 80 (mg/dL, mg/hg) ethanol in muscle, and Propanol (N-) was detected in muscle; no ethanol was detected in the brain. The report noted that putrefaction of the specimens had occurred. - The southwest section of the National Weather Service surface analysis chart depicted a thermal low pressure system west of the accident site. The closest upper air sounding from Yuma, Arizona, about 90 miles south of the accident site, depicted thermal profiles that supported strong thermals through 8,500 ft. The lifted index (a common measure of atmospheric instability) and the K-index (a measure of thunderstorm potential) indicated conditions conducive to development of significant updrafts or thermals of rising air and dust devils. Other weather products supported strong thermals to 11,000 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo people near the accident site reported seeing numerous large dust devils. One person was an airframe and powerplant mechanic driving on a highway, and he saw as many as five dust devils simultaneously. The other person was the pilot of an R44 who was performing aerial survey work immediately north of the accident site. He stated that beginning at 1130 the winds became stronger and gustier. Over the next couple of hours, he observed numerous dust devils, and experienced a significant updraft in excess of 1,000 ft per minute. About 1515, he decided to discontinue operations and encountered a significant wind shift while returning to his base.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA dust devil is a strong, well-formed whirlwind that can range from a few feet to hundreds of feet wide, and can reach heights of several hundred feet. In the United States, dust devils have been reported in every state with Arizona reporting the highest frequencies of occurrence, and they are most frequent between June and August. They have been implicated as a cause or contributing factor in about 50 aircraft accidents between 2000 and 2015 according to the NTSB database. - The helicopter came to rest in hilly desert terrain. The debris field was about 750 yards long and 150 yards wide. One of the first pieces identified was the outboard 5 ft of a main rotor blade afterbody that had separated from the leading edge spar and displayed black paint transfer marks near the tip. It was located on the top of a small ridgeline. The inboard section of this main rotor blade was about 600 yards into the debris field and 85 yards left of the debris path centerline.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left side of the helicopter was more fragmented than the right; left side cabin pieces and instruments were distributed throughout the early part of the debris field. The tail boom was about midway into the debris field. The left side/nose cabin, which was located near the tail boom had a straight separation line or slice across one side, and some floor panels at the aft end of the slice were crushed in an accordion pattern. The cabin came to rest inverted about 600 yards into the debris field, and was destroyed by a postcrash fire. The engine remained attached to the cabin.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe transmission, mast, and second main rotor blade separated as a unit, and were about 100 yards past the cabin area in the direction of the centerline of the debris field. The coning bolt of the separated blade was bent, and the teeter stops for both blades had impact marks across their centers. The attached blade was bent midspan about 10° to 20° opposite the direction of rotation. The main rotor driveshaft was bent about 15° at the swashplate. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "During the 2 to 3 hours before the accident, a witness saw the commercial pilot drinking from a cup that smelled like alcohol and noticed that he refilled the cup two or three times. He then  heard the pilot say that he was going to put on an airshow. The helicopter lifted off at a 45° angle backward and upward, reach an altitude of about 125 ft, and then descend out of sight behind hangars. A postaccident examination revealed that the helicopter's tail contacted the ground behind the hangars resulting in separation of both tail rotor blades. The helicopter then rose above the hangars and began to spin. The helicopter descended again, impacted terrain, and burst into flames.  The examination of the wreckage did not reveal evidence of any preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter. Toxicology testing detected diphenhydramine, a sedating antihistamine, and elevated levels of ethanol in the pilot's blood and tissues. The pilot was most likely impaired by the combination of ingested alcohol and the use of diphenhydramine, both of which are central nervous system depressants. The impairing effects of the combination of these substances most likely contributed to his decision to fly after drinking alcohol as well as his inability to maintain control of the helicopter.",
    "FactualNarrative": "N789MR, serial number 10561, was a Robinson R44 II, Raven, four-place, two-bladed, single main rotor, single-engine helicopter, with a spring and yield skid type landing gear. The primary structure of its fuselage was welded steel tubing and riveted aluminum sheet. The tailcone was a monocoque structure consisting of an aluminum skin. A Lycoming IO-540- AE1A5, serial number L-29728-48A, engine rated at 260 horsepower, powered the helicopter. However, according to the helicopter's type certificate, the engine had a 5-minute takeoff rating of 245 horsepower and a maximum continuous rating of 205 horsepower.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of helicopter logbook excerpts that were provided by a FAA inspector, showed that the helicopter's last annual inspection was completed on July 2, 2015. At the time of that inspection, the helicopter had accumulated a total time of 1,242.1 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter manufacturer issued, R44 Service Bulletin (SB)-78B, on December 20, 2010, and issued a revised SB on September 28, 2012. The SB, in part, stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTO: R44 and R44 II owners, operators, and maintenance personnel&#x0D;\nSUBJECT: Bladder Fuel Tank Retrofit&#x0D;\nROTORCRAFT AFFECTED: R44 helicopters S/N 0001 thru 2064, and R44 II&#x0D;\nhelicopters S/N 10001 thru 12890, unless previously accomplished.&#x0D;\nTIME OF COMPLIANCE: As soon as practical, but no later than 30 April 2013.&#x0D;\nBACKGROUND: This bulletin requires R44 helicopters with all-aluminum&#x0D;\nfuel tanks to be retrofitted with bladder-type tanks. In addition to a&#x0D;\nfactory retrofit program, a field kit is now available. To improve the R44&#x0D;\nfuel system's resistance to a post-accident fuel leak, this retrofit must&#x0D;\nbe performed as soon as possible.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe review of the helicopter logbook excerpts did not reveal an entry for the installation of the bladder fuel tanks as called for by the SB. - 23AR was a private, non-towered airport, which was owned by an individual. It was located about 7 miles east of Jonesboro, Arkansas. The airport had an estimated elevation of 260 ft above mean sea level. The airport's published runway 17/35 was 2,600 ft by 80 ft with a turf surface.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother, privately-owned, north/south-oriented turf runway was located about 350 ft west of 23R's published runway. - On June 12, 2016, about 1530 central daylight time, a Robinson Helicopter Company, R44 II, Raven, helicopter, N789MR, impacted terrain during takeoff from the Classic Airstrip (23AR), near Jonesboro, Arkansas. The commercial pilot, who was the sole occupant, was fatally injured. The helicopter was destroyed during the impact and subsequent ground fire. The helicopter was registered to Floyd Vuncannon Aviation Inc. and was operated by the pilot as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 personal flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the airport about the time of the accident, and the flight was not operated on a flight plan. The local flight was originating from 23AR at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was visiting a friend at an airstrip located just west of 23AR, reported that before noon, he saw the accident pilot drinking from a red cup that smelled like alcohol. The pilot refilled the cup 2 or 3 times during the next 2 or 3 hours. During the day, he saw the pilot going between hangars. When the witness finished working on a task, he heard the pilot say that he was going to put on an airshow. The witness saw the accident pilot getting into his helicopter, which was located east of him on 23AR. The witness observed the helicopter lift off at a 45° angle backward and upward. The helicopter rose to about 125 ft and then descended out of sight behind hangars that were located between 23AR's runway and the west airstrip. The witness reported that he thought he \"heard it hit\" but the engine never shutdown. The helicopter began to rise upwards above the hangars and it began to spin around. It appeared that the tail rotor was not working and the skids were bent as if it had hit the ground. The helicopter continued to rise to about the same height as when it lifted off. The helicopter then descended again, impacted terrain, and burst into flames in the middle of the west airstrip. The witness stated that another witness nearby called 911 and they waited for first responders to arrive. - The Arkansas State Crime Lab Medical Examiner's Office conducted an autopsy on the pilot and took toxicological samples. The autopsy indicated that the pilot's cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries and the manner of death was an accident. No significant natural disease was identified during the autopsy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory performed toxicological testing on the samples taken during the autopsy. The toxicology report indicated that the samples sustained putrefaction and listed the following findings:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n418 (mg/dL, mg/hg) Ethanol detected in Blood&#x0D;\n336 (mg/dL, mg/hg) Ethanol detected in Heart&#x0D;\n309 (mg/dL, mg/hg) Ethanol detected in Lung&#x0D;\n182 (mg/dL, mg/hg) Ethanol detected in Kidney&#x0D;\n152 (mg/dL, mg/hg) Ethanol detected in Urine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n...&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDiphenhydramine detected in Urine&#x0D;\n0.049 (ug/ml, ug/g) Diphenhydramine detected in Blood&#x0D;\nPioglitazone detected in Urine&#x0D;\nValsartan detected in Urine&#x0D;\nValsartan detected in Blood&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEthanol is the intoxicant commonly found in beer, wine, and liquor. It acts as a central nervous system (CNS) depressant. After ingestion, at low doses, it impairs judgment, psychomotor functioning, and vigilance; at higher doses it can cause coma and death. The effects of ethanol on aviators are generally well understood; it significantly impairs pilots' performance, even at very low levels. Federal Aviation Regulations prohibit any person from acting or attempting to act as a crewmember of a civil aircraft while having 0.040 gm/dl (40 mg/dl) or more ethanol in the blood. Ethanol may also be produced in the body after death by microbial activity.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDiphenhydramine is a sedating antihistamine used to treat allergy symptoms and as a sleep aid. It is available over the counter under many names including Benadryl and Unisom. Diphenhydramine carries the following FDA warning: \"may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery).\" The therapeutic range of diphenhydramine is 0.0250 to 0.1120 ug/ml; this is the range of blood levels where psychoactive effects are expected. Diphenhydramine undergoes postmortem redistribution where, after death, the drug can leech from storage sites back into blood. Central postmortem levels may be about two to three times higher than peripheral levels. Compared to other antihistamines, diphenhydramine causes marked sedation; it is also classed as a CNS depressant, and this is the rationale for its use as a sleep aid. Altered mood and impaired cognitive and psychomotor performance may also be observed. In a driving simulator study, a single dose of diphenhydramine impaired driving ability more than a blood alcohol concentration of 0.100%.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nValsartan is a prescription blood pressure medication often marketed with the name Diovan. It is not generally considered impairing. Pioglitazone is a prescription medication for diabetes; it is often marketed with the name Actos. It is not generally considered impairing and does not lead to the development of hypoglycemia.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the pilot's FAA medical records indicated that he had reported no chronic medical conditions and no medication use to the FAA. - At 1538, the recorded weather at the Jonesboro Municipal Airport, near Jonesboro, Arkansas, located about 5 miles west of 23AR,  included wind 090° at 4 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, present weather thunderstorms in the vicinity, temperature 34° C, dew point 21° C, and altimeter 30.02 inches of mercury. - The 73-year-old pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commercial pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land, rotorcraft helicopter, rotorcraft gyroplane, and instrument airplane ratings. He also held a flight instructor certificate, expiring October 31, 2017, with airplane single engine, rotorcraft helicopter, and rotorcraft gyroplane ratings. He held a FAA second-class medical certificate issued on May 1, 2014, with the limitations that he \"must wear corrective lenses and possess glasses for near and intermediate vision.\" At the time of that medical examination, he reported 6,000 hours total flight time and 110 hours in the 6 months before that examination. A review of excerpts from the pilot's logbook did not reveal an entry for a flight review. The logbook pages were not totaled, and the last entry was dated August 2, 2015. - The main helicopter wreckage was located about 1,800 ft on a magnetic heading of 35° from the intersection of Highway 18 and Barnhill Road. The turf, in a circular shaped area around the helicopter was found charred. Portions or the helicopter wreckage were discolored, deformed, and consumed by fire consistent with a ground fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's resting heading was about 270° magnetic. The tailcone was folded to the left and separated near its forward end. Most of the aluminum and fiberglass components of the fuselage were discolored, deformed, and consumed by fire. The separated aft section of the tailcone was located about 20 ft south of the airframe. The tail rotor gearbox remained attached to the aft bulkhead of the separated section of the tailcone. The empennage separated from the aft bulkhead and was located about 40 ft south of the airframe. The main rotor gearbox and main rotor were separated from the airframe and found about 3 ft north of the airframe. Ground scars north of the airframe were consistent with main rotor blade strikes. Main rotor blade tip pieces were recovered in and near the ground scars and yellow paint that matched the paint on the main rotor blade tips  was transferred to the dirt inside the scars.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth tail rotor blades were separated near their roots and were found east of the airframe on the other side of the hangar located between 23R and the west airstrip. A series of ground scars consistent with the shape, size, and spacing of tail rotor blade strikes were located east of the location that the tail rotor blades were found.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn on-scene examination of the wreckage revealed that all flight control rod ends remained attached to their attachment points. Sections of push pull tubes were not continuous, separated from their original location, and/or consumed by fire. All flight control discontinuities exhibited either thermal damage or separations consistent with overload. No preimpact anomalies were detected in the flight control system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel mixture control knob was found in the full rich position. The mixture control wire was found disconnected near its fuel mixture arm on the engine fuel control servo unit. The throttle linkage sustained thermal damage and its position could not be determined. The governor switch sustained thermal damage and its position could not be determined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right skid tube was located under the main wreckage and it sustained thermal damage. The four struts that attached the left and right skid tubes  were separated from the airframe and were thermally damaged. The aft cross tube appeared to be thermally deformed. A portion of the front cross tube was consumed by fire and the remaining end was not bent near its elbow.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nObserved damage to the cabin structure included deformation, discoloration, and consumption by fire. The removable cyclic and collective were recovered from under seat debris, and the removable pedals were installed. The pedals were found in a neutral position. The vertical tube of the cyclic control was bent aft. The cyclic grip was consumed by fire. The aft left and right doors were found in the main wreckage and they sustained thermal damage. The two front doors were not identified or found in the wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe upper and lower frames were bent and had some separations in their tubes. The surface of the separations exhibited angular and jagged features consistent with overload. The lower edge of the vertical firewall was deformed. The tailcone was bent to the left and thermally damaged at its forward end.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe separated aft section of the tailcone exhibited deformation damage consistent with several tail rotor blade strikes. The empennage was separated from the aft bulkhead. The surface of the separation was rough and jagged. The lower vertical stabilizer was bent to the right as viewed from its aft looking forward. A segment of the tail rotor guard that included the guard's curved section was separated below its forward mount and forward of its aft mount. The surfaces of the guard's separations were angular and jagged. The aft section of the tail rotor guard remained attached to its mount and the tip of the tail rotor guard exhibited witness marks consistent with scuffing on its lower left surface. The tailskid had some witness marks on its lowest bottom surface consistent with scuffing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSections of the V-belts were consumed by fire with charred sections remaining in the grooves of the upper sheave and on the ground below the lower sheave. The alignment strut's outer rod end for the upper sheave exhibited a separation consistent with overload. No scoring was visible on the sheave face. Scoring was visible on the rod end jam nut adjacent to the aft sheave face. The overrunning clutch operated properly. The actuator was extended about 1 inch.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor gearbox was separated at the upper housing. The main rotor driveshaft was bent about 15° at the swashplate. The mast tube was bent and exhibited thermal discoloration and damage. Both elastomeric teeter stops were consumed by fire and their brackets were bent across the center. One droop stop tusk was bent downward and the spindle was found cracked with and an angular and jagged separation surface. The other spindle coning bolthole was deformed. Both main rotor blades exhibited thermal damage and deformation consistent with impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lower frame tube adjacent to the intermediate flex coupling exhibited rotational scoring. The tail rotor driveshaft was bent near its forward end and was disconnected just aft of the bend. The tail rotor drive shaft damper bearing bracket was separated from the bulkhead. The damper bearing exhibited thermal damage and would not rotate. The tail rotor gearbox rotated with no anomalies. Oil was visible in its sight gage. The blades were separated near their roots. The surface of the tail rotor blades' separations exhibited angular and jagged features consistent with overload. Both blades were bent to the right and they exhibited leading edge damage at their tips. One blade exhibited deformation damage that was consistent with contact with rivet locations on the tailcone. Witness marks running chordwise near the blade tips were present on both blades, which appeared to be consistent with terrain contact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nObserved damage to the cooling fan included discoloration and it was deformed around its forward edge. The cooling scroll was consumed by fire. The alternator and its cooling fan exhibited thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was found lying upright and it remained attached to its tubular engine mounts. The exterior surfaces of the engine were discolored consistent with exposure to a post-impact fire. Sections of the oil sump were consumed in the fire. The fuel servo was found separated and partially thermally consumed. The remaining rear mounted accessories exhibited features consistent with fire damaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was partially disassembled. The engine's crankshaft was rotated by turning the cooling fan, and continuity of the crankshaft to the rear gears and to the valve train were confirmed. Thumb compression and suction were observed from all six cylinders as the engine was rotated. The interiors of the cylinders were examined using a lighted borescope and no anomalies were noted. The two-piece fuel injector nozzles were disassembled and found to be unobstructed. Disassembly of both magnetos revealed that their internal components sustained thermal damage. The removed sparkplug electrodes exhibited light brown coloration and worn out normal condition when compared to the Champion Check-A-Plug chart. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "While departing from an elevated wood platform, the pilot elected to make a sliding takeoff, and after the helicopter's skids had slid forward about 2.5 ft, the skid plate on the bottom of the helicopter's right skid caught on a raised deck screw that had backed out of the platform. The pilot attempted to free the skid by applying power and pitching the helicopter forward. As the skid broke free, the helicopter pivoted forward and yawed to the right.  The helicopter impacted the ground in a near-vertical attitude, and the main rotor blades contacted the service truck's cab.  An individual on the ground was struck and fatally injured by debris from the helicopter. The pilot reported no mechanical malfunctions with the helicopter prior to the accident, and did not recall inspecting the landing platform the morning of the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On May 13, 2016, about 0715 central daylight time, a Bell 47G-3B-1 helicopter, N48316, collided with a service truck during takeoff near Portia, Arkansas. One person on the ground was fatally injured. The helicopter was substantially damaged and the pilot was not injured. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Hammock Flying Services INC under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 as an aerial application flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated without a flight plan. The local flight was originating at the time of the accident.According to the pilot, the helicopter landed on an elevated wood platform located on top of the service truck. After being loaded with fuel and a herbicide mixture, the helicopter started to lift off. The helicopter's skid caught a piece of the elevated platform and the pilot attempted to free the helicopter due adding power and pitching forward. The pilot was unable to free the helicopter and lost control of the helicopter was it continued to pitch forward. The main rotors contacted the service truck and the helicopter impacted terrain. Substantial damage was sustained to the helicopter's main rotors, tail boom, and fuselage. Debris from the helicopter struck and fatally injured a person on the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of the helicopter revealed substantial damage to the helicopter's main rotors, tail boom, and fuselage. Examination of the landing platform revealed that a large deck screw had backed out of the platform. Damage to the platform was consistent with the helicopter's right skid catching the raised screw during the lift off. The pilot reported no mechanical malfunctions with the helicopter prior to the accident. In addition, he did not recall inspecting the landing platform the morning of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that they are in the processing of upgrading the service trucks. The improvements included self-locking hardware for the screws on the platforms to prevent the regular deck screw from backing out. In addition, the other trucks included extra railings to protect the service person. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The non-instrument-rated commercial pilot was making a visual flight rules internal-cargo company flight in the helicopter. He was returning to base in the helicopter after dropping off 1 employee and 12 dogs at a remote dog camp situated on a glacier surrounded by mountainous terrain. The pilot had previously completed 5 of the day's 7 planned roundtrip flights from the base to the dog camp.  According to the dog camp manager, the weather was deteriorating with snow and wind increasing when the pilot departed on the accident flight. The dog camp manager's observations and radar data indicated that the pilot attempted to depart via the normal route to the south but turned around. He likely encountered low visibility conditions and then attempted several departures by routes to the north of the dog camp. About 8 minutes after departure, the helicopter impacted snow-covered mountainous terrain about 2 miles northeast of the dog camp. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Given the deteriorating weather conditions when the pilot departed, it is likely that the pilot continued visual flight into an area of instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in the pilot experiencing a loss of visual reference and subsequent controlled flight into terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the impact sequence, the two cargo straps used to secure two wooden dog boxes to the rear cabin floor failed, and the dog boxes shifted forward, striking the back of the pilot's fiberglass seat. It could not be determined if the forward movement of the dog boxes during the accident sequence contributed to the injuries sustained by the pilot. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImmediately before departing from the dog camp on the accident flight, the pilot told the dog camp manager that, due to the degrading weather conditions, he would not be coming back for the last scheduled trip of the day, and the dog camp manager told the pilot that he agreed with him. However, the pilot then told the dog camp manager, \"but don't give up on me yet,\" a statement consistent with self-induced pressure to complete the day's series of flights. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn one of the day's previous flights, the pilot reported to the base manager, who was exercising operational control at the time of the accident, that he had encountered icing conditions while in flight. The base manager told the pilot \"to do what he thought was best.\" However, flight operations in icing conditions are prohibited by the helicopter's rotorcraft flight manual and the operator's operations manual, and the pilot's statement should have prompted the base manager to suspend the flights. If flight operations had been cancelled for the day when the pilot reported the icing conditions, the subsequent flights, including the accident flight, would not have occurred. The base manager's failure to appropriately exercise operational control and terminate the flights may have been due to the difference in experience between the base manager, who had been operating these flights for 8 years, and the pilot, who had been operating these flights for 25 years.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Carriage of Internal Cargo in Airbus AS 350 Series Helicopters&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB IIC submitted multiple inquiries during the investigation to the FAA Office of Accident Investigation and Prevention, Washington, DC, regarding the carriage of internal cargo in the Airbus AS 350 series. On March 28, 2017, the FAA responded, in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA does not require original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to publish information regarding cargo loading. The certification assumption is that the helicopter will be used to carry people, unless indicated otherwise by the applicant. In the case of the AS350, Airbus did not indicate that anything other than passengers will be carried. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn its March 28, 2017, response, the FAA also stated: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAny \"approved\" cargo installation will be explained in the rotorcraft flight manual (RFM) limitation or supplement section – (what tie-downs are used, what straps are used, etc.); loading instructions (what areas in the cabin get loaded first, second, etc.); and procedures (walk around procedures will mention to verify cargo secured). Operators do not have certification approval to install cargo in the cabin unless it is mentioned in the RFM or [RFM supplement] RFMS (part of the [type certificate] TC or an STC) – installation instructions are provided in the flight manual. It is possible that there may be some operators that have been using existing tie-downs/seat rails to tie down cargo in the cabin, and incorrectly assuming that this is a \"certified\" installation when in fact it is not. … The RFM or RFM supplement will be clear as to what is approved regarding internal cargo (if it does not mention how and where to install cargo, then it's not certified). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a response on August 25, 2017, the FAA stated, \"our position is the same as in the other queries from the NTSB regarding cabin cargo – operators should not be securing cargo in areas unless doing so has been FAA approved (basic design, design change, field approval, etc.).\" In a letter dated August 29, 2017, the FAA stated, in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlso, while a definition for a cargo/baggage compartment in rotorcraft does not exist, the FAA has interpreted this as a compartment (enclosed area) that is separated from the cabin (passenger area). … Additionally, the FAA is not aware of any documentation that would prohibit Part 27 rotorcraft from carrying cargo in the cabin, even if a certification does not exist for that helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB submitted a follow-up question to the FAA asking:  From a regulatory aspect: If an aircraft is not certified for a particular task, does it mean that the task is prohibited? The specific example that is being investigated is the carriage of cargo in the main cabin of helicopters certified under Part 27. Most rotorcraft operating manuals don't address the carriage of cargo. Most Part 27 helicopters do not have certification for the carriage of cargo. Does that mean the carriage of cargo in these helicopters is prohibited? &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn January 25, 2018, the FAA responded, stating, in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Aircraft Certification Service (AIR) certificates designs that are compliant with the applicable airworthiness standards.  AIR does not approve operations (i.e. particular tasks); operational approvals are issued by the FAA's Flight Standards Service (AFS).  When AIR certificates a design for a certain operation, the certification only ensures the design meets the design requirements set forth by the FAA. Approved cabin cargo designs include pertinent safety information such as maximum weight of the cargo, location of the cargo in the cabin, and how the cargo is secured to the airframe. … As previously stated by FAA, if an FAA-approved cabin cargo configuration has been published for a specific aircraft, the flight manual for that aircraft is where the information will be found.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs previously stated, review of the Airbus AS 350 B2 RFM found that it discusses required placards in the limitations section and states that a loading instruction placard is to be mounted on the side face of the control pedestal. No other information regarding the carriage of cargo in the cabin was found in the RFM. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRegarding internal cargo, the Airbus AS 350 Systems and Descriptions Manual states, \"further to removing the front [left seat] and folding back the rear benches, the cabin floor can be used to transport cargo. The eleven mooring points are embedded into the floor and are also used to attach the seatbelts.\" The manual also lists the \"limit permissible force on a mooring ring\" as 620 dekanewtons or 1393.7 pound-force. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn April 21, 2017, Airbus stated in an email to the NTSB IIC that \"it is the responsibility of the operator to define an adapted cargo, freight, or baggage securement that is in respect to the limitations permissible force on the floor stowing mooring rings.\" On June 26, 2018, the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la sécurité de l'aviation civile reported to the NTSB IIC that Airbus has developed a \"cargo installation in cabin\" procedure for the Airbus AS 350 series, which is currently in the certification process.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHelicopter Internal Cargo Securement&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe US Army's Training Circular 3-04.4, Fundamentals of Flight, discusses the securement of internal cargo in helicopters and states:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAircraft are subjected to G-forces resulting from air turbulence, acceleration, rough or crash landings, and aerial maneuvers. Since the cargo is moving at the same rate of speed as the aircraft, forward movement is the strongest force likely to act on cargo if the aircraft is suddenly slowed or stopped. Other forces which tend to shift cargo aft, laterally, or vertically will be less severe. Restraining or tie-down devices prevent cargo movement that could result in injury to occupants, damage to the aircraft or cargo, or cause the aircraft center of gravity to move out of limits. The amount of restraint required to keep cargo from moving in any direction is called restraint criteria and is expressed in Gs. The maximum force exerted by an item of cargo is equal to its normal weight times the number of Gs specified in restraint criteria. Restraint criteria are normally different for each type of aircraft and provided in the operator's manual. To prevent cargo movement, the amount of restraint applied should equal or exceed the amount of restraint required. Restraint is referred to by the direction in which it keeps cargo from moving. For example, forward restraint keeps cargo from moving forward and aft restraint keeps cargo from moving aft. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA search revealed no regulatory guidance or best practices available from the FAA regarding the care, inspection, and maintenance of cargo straps used for internal cargo operations with helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSelf-Induced Pressure &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Helicopter Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-21, discusses effective aeronautical decision-making and, with regard to operational pitfalls, states, in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere are numerous classic behavioral traps that can ensnare the unwary pilot. Pilots, particularly those with considerable experience, try to complete a flight as planned, please passengers, and meet schedules. This basic drive to achieve can have an adverse effect on safety and can impose an unrealistic assessment of piloting skills under stressful conditions. These tendencies ultimately may bring about practices that are dangerous and sometimes illegal and may lead to a mishap. Pilots develop awareness and learn to avoid many of these operational pitfalls through effective single-pilot resource management training. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAviation Safety in Alaska&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB's safety study, Aviation Safety in Alaska SS-95/03, discusses aviation safety issues with weather and risk taking in Alaska and states, in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlying weather in Alaska can be quite variable depending on the climate zone and time of year. Although all parts of Alaska experience periods of instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), such conditions are frequent in the Aleutian Islands, Alaska Peninsula, southeast Alaska, and the Arctic Coast during the summer and early fall. Weather conditions can change rapidly in Alaska, and the vast distances between some reporting points will often conceal significant local variations in the weather. VFR flight into IMC usually involves poor pilot decision making, whether in initiating the flight or continuing it into adverse weather. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTraining Device and Simulator Usage&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator was asked by the NTSB IIC if any aviation training devices (ATD), flight training devices (FTD), or full flight simulators (FFS) for training Airbus AS 350 pilots in Alaska in areas such as flight operations in flat light conditions, flight operations in degraded visual meteorological conditions, and IIMC recovery were utilized. The operator reported that they use the actual helicopter and real-world training scenarios when training their pilots for operations in flat light conditions and degraded visual meteorological conditions. The operator has their pilots use instrument hood devices to train for IIMC avoidance and recovery. Additionally, the operator uses the actual helicopter and an FAA Capstone Project training device to assist in training terrain avoidance. The operator further reported that they are in the process of acquiring a level 5 FFS for the Airbus AS 350.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB has published Safety Alert SA-031, \"Safety Through Helicopters Simulators.\" This document discusses the benefits of utilizing helicopter simulators and states in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThrough simulator training, operators can provide pilots a valuable tool to ensure proficiency in emergency procedures, including autorotations, use of night vision goggles, recognition of degraded visual conditions, and recovery from unusual attitudes. Consistent, standardized simulator training will help prepare pilots for the unexpected and will decrease the risk of an accident. Simulators can be a helpful tool for operators to provide pilot training on degraded visual conditions, safe decision-making skills, and IIMC encounters. By practicing potential emergencies, pilots will be better equipped to handle emergency situations. - The 1991-model-year helicopter was equipped with a Safran (formerly Turbomeca) Arriel 1D1 turboshaft engine. According to the operator's records, at the time of the accident, the helicopter had accumulated 10,190.5 flight hours, and the engine had accumulated 4,281.6 hours. The most recent inspection of the airframe and engine was completed on December 17, 2015. An examination of the helicopter's maintenance records revealed no evidence of uncorrected mechanical discrepancies with the airframe and engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was originally manufactured as an AS 350 B and was converted to an AS 350 BA in 1992 and then to an AS 350 B2 in 2003. The helicopter was configured to be flown from the right front seat, which was a non-energy attenuating, fiberglass seat. The left front seat that was installed in the helicopter was a single-place, non-energy attenuating, fiberglass seat. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped with a radar altimeter, nor was it required to be at the time of the accident. The helicopter was equipped with a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Capstone Project avionics package. The skid system of the helicopter included snow/tundra boards mounted on the aft ends of both skid tubes along with an emergency floatation system on both skid tubes. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEMSCO configured the helicopter cabin to facilitate the transportation of internal cargo. The rear seat assembly was folded up against the cabin wall, and two wood, dog transportation boxes were placed behind the front seats. A tarp, blanket, and wood shoring were placed between the lower box and the cabin floor. The dog boxes were stacked vertically and secured using two cargo straps attached to a total of four seat belt attachment rings installed on the floor of the cabin. Both cargo straps were secured to the rear seat belt attachment points in front of the aft cabin wall, routed over the top of the stacked boxes, and secured to the pilot and front passenger seat belt attachment points. With the configuration of the two cargo straps, forward restraint was present; however, no lateral restraint was present. Neither dog box had a placarded weight value on the outside of it. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe make and model of the cargo straps, as well as the maximum load rating of the straps, could not be determined. The two cargo straps had abrasions at various locations along with unknown stains throughout the length of the straps. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Airbus AS 350 B2 rotorcraft flight manual (RFM) discusses required placards in the limitations section and states that a loading instruction placard is to be mounted on the side face of the control pedestal. On the accident helicopter, the placard was found mounted on the rear of the control pedestal. This placard listed the \"distributed loads maximum\" for the rear cabin floor as 682 pounds. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe combined weight of the two wood dog boxes was 190.5 pounds; the wood boards used for shoring on the cabin floor weighed 9.5 pounds; and the blanket, tarp, and two cargo straps weighed 5 pounds. The total weight of 205 pounds was not included on the cargo manifest documents for the day's flights or the helicopter's weight and balance record.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn each of the first four flights from Skagway to the dog camp, the total dog weight entered on the cargo manifest form was 500 pounds (10 dogs on board). On the fifth flight, the dog weight entered was 550 pounds (11 dogs on board). On the sixth flight, the dog weight entered was 600 pounds (12 dogs on board). For all six flights from Skagway to the dog camp, the weight of the dog boxes and related items (205 pounds) combined with the dog weight resulted in the structural limitation of 682 pounds being exceeded. - The helicopter was not equipped and was not required to be equipped with a cockpit voice recorder, flight data recorder, or image recorder. A Latitude Technologies S200-001 flight tracker, a Garmin GDL 90 datalink transceiver, and an AKV ETM 1000 engine and rotor system monitoring device were recovered from the wreckage. These electronic devices were not designed for crash resistance or survivability.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Latitude Technologies Corporation S200-001 flight tracker, which was used by TEMSCO for flight tracking purposes, was transported to the manufacturer's facility in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, for an examination of the unit and subsequent data download. According to the manufacturer, the unit had the original firmware installed from when the unit was released in February 2009 with no subsequent firmware updates. The manufacturer additionally reported that this build of firmware had a previously unknown \"bug\" resulting in the data being captured in the background log being identical to the data that were transmitted while the helicopter was in flight with no additional GPS data in between the transmitted logs being captured. At the time of the accident, the operator had the \"ping rate\" set to every 120 seconds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Garmin GDL 90 and the AK ETM 1000 devices were submitted to the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for examination and download. No track or navigation data was stored on the Garmin GDL 90. Various engine and main rotor system parameters were recorded for the accident flight on the AK ETM 1000.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRefer to the Recorder Specialist's Factual Report in the public docket for further information regarding the Garmin GDL 90 and an AKV ETM 1000 devices. - On May 6, 2016, about 1900 Alaska daylight time, an Airbus (formerly Eurocopter) AS 350 B2 helicopter, N94TH, collided with snow-covered mountainous terrain about 4 miles southeast of Skagway, Alaska, after departing from a remote landing site on the Denver Glacier. The commercial pilot received fatal injuries, and the helicopter sustained substantial damage. The helicopter was registered to and operated by TEMSCO Helicopters, Inc., Ketchikan, Alaska, under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a visual flight rules (VFR) internal-cargo company flight. Instrument meteorological conditions were reported on the Denver Glacier at the time of the accident, and company flight following procedures were in effect. The flight originated from a heliport at the operator's headquarters in Skagway about 1840, landed at the remote site for several minutes, and departed for the return flight about 1852.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlaska Icefield Expeditions, Inc., contracted with TEMSCO to provide helicopter support for the movement of personnel, dogs, and cargo. The purpose of the flight was to transport dog camp company personnel (mushers) and dogs (Alaskan Huskies) from the operator's headquarters in Skagway to a remote dog camp on the Denver Glacier in the Tongass National Forest, about 5 miles southeast of Skagway. TEMSCO and Alaska Icefield Expeditions conducted heli-mushing operations for the Alaska tourism industry using a helicopter glacier landing permit issued by the US Forest Service. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was scheduled for seven continuous roundtrip flights (without shutting down the helicopter) to the dog camp on the day of the accident. All flights scheduled for the day of the accident fell under the operational control of the base manager, who was located at TEMSCO's headquarters in Skagway. The pilot was ready to begin flight operations at 0800, but low ceilings prevented flight operations. The pilot attended company orientation training at 0900, and, at 1300, he provided helicopter loading training for new TEMSCO employees. At 1530, the pilot completed the training and evaluated the weather for flight operations. The pilot determined that the wind conditions were unsuitable at the time but were forecasted to improve later in the afternoon. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe dog camp manager, who was located at the dog camp on the Denver Glacier, was responsible for managing operations of the dog camp. He reported that, on the day of the accident, from about 0600 to 1200, the weather in the dog camp was cloudy, snowing, and foggy, and the visibility was \"a few hundred yards.\" At 1200, the clouds broke, the snow stopped, and visibility was such that he could see through Paradise Valley across the Taiya Inlet. He reported that flight operations were cancelled because of the wind; the wind on the glacier was between 10 and 15 mph. About 1630, TEMSCO informed the dog camp manager, that flight operations would begin to deliver mushers and dogs to the camp. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1645, the wind speed had dropped significantly at the base, and the pilot decided it was safe to launch. The pilot completed two roundtrips, each with 1 musher and 10 dogs on board the helicopter. The dog camp manager stated that it was snowing as these flights arrived. At 1738, the pilot called inbound from the Denver Glacier to the base, and the base manager asked the pilot about the weather conditions. The pilot reported to the base manger that there was turbulence around the toe of the glacier and that he was keeping his airspeed down for a smoother ride. Based on the pilot's report, the base manager decided to cancel a scheduled external load flight that he had planned to fly and load the cargo internally in another helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1747, the helicopter departed from the base for the third trip, again with 1 musher and 10 dogs onboard. En route to the glacier, the pilot reported to the base manager that he \"experienced a little bit of inflight icing\" at 3,000 ft mean sea level (msl). The base manager asked the pilot what kind of precipitation he was experiencing, and the pilot reported \"wet snow.\" The base manager told the pilot \"to do what he thought was best.\" The pilot responded that he would evaluate the icing conditions as he flew on the subsequent flights. The fourth and fifth roundtrips were completed uneventfully; the fourth carried 1 musher and 10 dogs, and the fifth carried 1 musher and 11 dogs. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1840, the helicopter departed for the sixth trip with 1 musher and 12 dogs onboard. As the helicopter passed through Paradise Valley, the passenger reported that the valley itself was \"wide open\" with a rainbow present, but he and the pilot could see that the clouds were \"moving in\" as the helicopter approached the Denver Glacier. The passenger reported that the clouds were \"thick,\" and he could not see up the glacier toward the dog camp. The passenger further reported that the western mountain wall near the glacier was visible at the time, so the pilot elected to follow the wall into the dog camp \"very slowly.\" He stated that the helicopter was \"very low\" with regard to the bluff and was closer to the wall than he had ever been on previous flights up to the dog camp. The dog camp manager reported that just before the sixth flight arrived, the wind speed was up to 20 to 30 mph, and it was snowing. The clouds had moved in and covered the bluff; visibility was about a 1/4 mile looking toward Paradise Valley. The helicopter landed at the dog camp, and the musher and 12 dogs were unloaded. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBefore the pilot left, he signaled for the dog camp manager and told him that he was \"not coming back in this weather.\" The dog camp manager verbally agreed. The dog camp manager told the pilot to be safe, and the pilot said to the dog camp manager, \"but don't give up on me yet.\" The pilot then departed from the dog camp at 1852 and headed toward Paradise Valley. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the dog camp manager, the helicopter traveled about 1/8 mile toward Paradise Valley, turned around, and then turned north. The dog camp manager reported that the visibility looking north from the dog camp appeared to be about 1/4 mile. He noticed that the snow rate had picked up \"considerably,\" and the wind speed was still between 20 and 30 mph. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of Harris OpsVue track data was conducted during the timeframe of 1815 to 1915. The OpsVue data indicated the accident helicopter was making multiple 360° turns before turning to the north and east and continuing to make turns. As the helicopter was tracking toward the east, the altitude was trending up in a slow climb before descending near the accident site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1900, the TEMSCO base manager noted that he had not heard any communication on the radio for a few minutes, so he asked about the status of the accident helicopter and noticed on the flight tracking computer that the helicopter's position was northwest of the dog camp at an elevation of about 6,200 ft msl, about 2,000 ft above the dog camp's elevation. He made several radio calls to the pilot, and no responses were received. After repeated radio calls with no response from the pilot, the base manager decided to launch in a helicopter with an observer on onboard. The company emergency response plan was activated. At 1914, the base manager departed to the last known coordinates of the missing helicopter. The base manager reported that he was unable to fly over the dog camp via Paradise Valley at 1924 due to low ceilings, blowing snow, and turbulence.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1942, the base manager reported that he was maneuvering near the North Denver Icefall area, and he was unable to climb higher than 4,000 ft msl due to low ceilings, blowing snow, and \"mechanical\" turbulence. By 1948, the base manager reported \"improving\" ceilings and being able to maneuver around 5,000 ft msl. At 2009, the base manager and observer visually confirmed the wreckage of the accident helicopter lying on its left side with the tailboom separated in steep, mountainous terrain near a frozen glacial lake, about 2 miles northeast of the dog camp.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the base manger confirmed the location of the wreckage, he asked if the dog camp personnel could travel to the wreckage site. The dog camp manager and several other workers rode two snow machines toward the wreckage; they noted the wind speed was between 30 and 40 mph and visibility was between zero and \"a few hundred feet\" in blowing snow. As they proceeded toward the wreckage, the wind speed increased to between 50 and 70 mph. The dog camp personnel were unable to proceed any farther due to the steep terrain and the possibility of avalanches. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe base manager attempted multiple times to land at the accident site but was unable to land due to high wind and flat light conditions. About 2200, a US Coast Guard helicopter attempted to access the accident site but was unsuccessful due to the wind conditions. After dumping fuel, the Coast Guard helicopter was able to access the accident site, and an aviation survival technician (helicopter rescue swimmer) confirmed one fatality in the wreckage. - The Alaska State Medical Examiner, Anchorage, Alaska, conducted an autopsy of the pilot. The cause of death for the pilot was attributed to multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Bioaeronautical Research Sciences Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology tests on specimens from the pilot that were negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and drugs. Cyanide tests were not performed. - The closest official weather observation station to the accident site was located at the Skagway Airport, Skagway, about 4 miles northwest of the accident site. At 1853, the reported weather conditions were wind 210° at 19 knots gusting to 28 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, few clouds at 8,000 ft, temperature 53°F, dew point 37°F, and altimeter setting 29.81 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRefer to the Meteorology Group Chairman's Factual Report in the public docket for further weather information. - TEMSCO Operations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe TEMSCO Operations Manual discusses icing conditions and states:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHelicopter flights during icing conditions are prohibited. TEMSCO shall not fly into known icing conditions. If icing conditions are encountered, the Pilot-in-Command will deviate from course to avoid and navigate around any encountered icing conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Airbus AS 350 B2 Rotorcraft Flight Manual lists \"flight in freezing rain or icing conditions (visible moisture and temperatures likely to produce ice)\" as a prohibited maneuver in the limitations section.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe TEMSCO Operations Manual discusses operational control and states:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOperational control with respect to a flight, means the exercise of authority over initiating, conducting, or terminating a flight. The Director of Operations and the pilot in command are jointly responsible for the initiation, continuation, diversion, and termination of a flight. The Director of Operations may delegate functions to other trained personnel, but retains responsibility for initiation, continuation, diversion, and termination. The final authority over conducting or terminating a flight rests with the pilot in command. The following persons have \"operational control\" with respect to flight in descending order: director of operations, chief pilot, pilot in command, second in command, director of maintenance, base managers, base lead pilot, and trained flight followers. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Order 8900.1, Flight Standards Information Management System, identifies one of several failure modes of operational control and states:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLoss of operational control within the air carrier – hands-off management results in inadequate controls over its own operations. Management of operations should never be inattentive, distracted, or careless. Hands-off management is not a legitimate excuse for failing to maintain operational control. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Operations Specification A008 Operational Control states that non-management personnel exercising operational control shall be specified in the general operations manual (names, titles, duties, responsibilities, and authorities). A review of the TEMSCO Operations Manual showed that, for the operational control chain of command, the base lead pilot positions were listed \"as assigned\" with no names listed, and the trained flight follower positions had no names listed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA formal flight risk assessment was not conducted by the pilot for the accident flight, nor was it required by the operator at the time of the accident. The TEMSCO Safety Management Systems Manual states that flight risk assessments are to be conducted for emergency medical services and tour operations. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe TEMSCO Operations Manual discusses company VFR weather minimums and states that, for the local operating area (within a 30-nautical-mile radius from the base of operations), a 500 ft ceiling or greater and 1 statue mile visibility or greater is required. The manual states that the lowest of the ceiling or visibility shall be the limiting factor for dispatch. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the TEMSCO Operations Manual found no operational procedures listed for flight operations in deteriorating VFR weather conditions (such as reduced visibility and ceilings), inadvertent instrument meteorological conditions (IIMC) avoidance procedures, or IIMC recovery procedures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEMSCO Internal Cargo Operations &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe TEMSCO Operations Manual discusses internal cargo carried in passenger compartments and states:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWill be secured by means approved by the FAA. Will be carried in accordance with each of the following: Will be properly secured by a safety belt or other tie down having enough strength to eliminate the possibility of shifting under normally anticipated flight and ground conditions. Will be packaged or covered to avoid possible injury to passengers. It will not impose any load on seats or on the floor structure that exceeds the load limitations for those requirements. It will not be located in a position that restricts the access to or use of any required emergency or regular exit, or the use of the aisle between the crew and the passenger compartment. It will not be carried directly above seated passengers. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThis document further discusses the limitations of carriage of cargo in the passenger compartments and states:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEach bay or bin will be able to withstand the load factor as applicable to passenger seats of the aircraft. The maximum weight of cargo that each bin or bay is approved to carry will not be exceeded. Each bay will be loaded to insure proper weight distribution when using cargo load schedule. The load will not impose any load on the floor or other structure of the aircraft that exceeds the limitations of that structure. The maximum concentrated load for each compartment will not be exceeded. The bin or netting for loose cargo will be attached to the seat tracks or to the floor structure of the aircraft and its attachment must withstand the load factors applicable to the passenger seats. The cargo will not restrict access to or use of any required exit or aisle in the passenger compartment. It will be the responsibility of the Pilot-In-Command to check and ensure that all cargo and passenger doors are properly secured prior to any flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that before the accident, the company conducted internal cargo load training for contract, charter, and utility pilots at company headquarters in Ketchikan, which was hands-on training that was both mission-specific and aircraft-specific with no training syllabus or published curriculum at the time. The training was not conducted with the tour pilots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the accident, the operator developed internal cargo loading guidelines for all company Airbus AS 350 pilots. This document covers cargo strap standards (what type to use), the various helicopter floor weight limitations, and the various limitations of the mooring rings. The document also highlights the importance of not exceeding any limitations of seat-belt-based mooring rings when a ring is used to restrain cargo and the seat is occupied.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTour Operators Program of Safety&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the operator was a member of the Tour Operators Program of Safety (TOPS). The most recent TOPS compliance audit on the operator before the accident took place from August 8 through August 10, 2015. All the audit areas (management, safety, flight operations, pilots, flight coordination, heliport, maintenance, maintenance personnel, and ground support personnel) along with base visits and flight observations were classified as \"meets TOPS standards.\" - The pilot, age 66, held a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating and held private pilot privileges for airplane single-engine land. The pilot did not have and was not required to have a helicopter instrument rating. His most recent second-class medical certificate was issued on February 27, 2016, with the limitation that he must wear corrective lenses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the pilot's total aeronautical experience was about 7,190 hours of which about 5,700 hours were in the accident helicopter make and model. In the 90 and 30 days before the accident, the pilot flew 5 and 3 flight hours, respectively. This was his 25th season with TEMSCO.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator's pilot training records showed no deficiencies and indicated that the pilot had completed all required training, including a competency check ride on March 19, 2016.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Skagway base manager, age 30, held a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter rating. His total aeronautical experience was about 3,445 hours, and this was his eighth season with TEMSCO. All of his eight seasons were in Skagway. - The pilot was seated in the front right seat and was wearing a 4-point restraint system at the time of the accident. The pilot did not wear and was not required to wear a flight helmet. - The caution-warning light panel from the helicopter was submitted to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for examination. The panel was x-rayed to determine the filament status of the light bulbs within the panel. The examination determined that none of the filaments exhibited hot filament stretching. - On May 8, 2016, the NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC), along with an additional NTSB investigator, an aviation safety inspector (ASI) from the FAA's Juneau Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), and a representative from TEMSCO traveled to the accident scene via helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll the major components of the helicopter were found at the main wreckage site. The accident site was in an area of steep, mountainous terrain covered with deep snow, at an elevation of about 4,200 ft mean sea level, near a frozen glacial lake. The impact point of the helicopter was on about a 090° heading (magnetic). Scattered downslope from the helicopter were small portions of wreckage debris, broken Plexiglass, and personal effects.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter fuselage was lying on its left side with the nose oriented to the south. The Artex ME406 emergency locator transmitter (ELT) antenna wire had separated during the accident sequence. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit was severely damaged with extensive deformation. The canopy was segmented and separated with all canopy glass windscreens and overhead transparencies shattered or missing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit levers and switches appeared to be configured for normal flight except for the guarded HYD TEST (in position), BATT/EPU (off position), and HORN switch (out position) on the center console, which had sustained impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft cabin was bent and buckled inward along the upper roof area. Both cargo straps used to secure the dog boxes were found separated. The top dog box was lodged in the forward cockpit area against the rear of the pilot's seat. The pilot's seat sustained multiple fractures to the rear and base of the seat, and the seat was separated from the floor. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe bottom of the fuselage exhibited severe deformation with a large section of the skin missing just below the fuel cell.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left skid remained relatively intact and was buried in snow. The right skid tube separated from the two crosstubes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom separated from the fuselage just aft of the fuselage. Both tail rotor blades exhibited damage consistent with multiple terrain strikes under power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe yellow main rotor blade remained attached to the Starflex assembly and was lying downhill from the fuselage. The red and blue main rotor blades, including part of the Starflex assembly, were partially buried beneath the snow and underneath the fuselage. All main rotor blade portions visible above the snow exhibited damage consistent with sudden stoppage associated with multiple terrain strikes while under power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor system, transmission, and engine areas displayed damage consistent with rolling over while under power after the initial impact with terrain. The left side of the main rotor system, transmission, and engine were lying against the snow-covered terrain. No evidence of preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airframe and engine were found during the onsite examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered from the accident site and transported to a secure hangar at the Juneau International Airport, Juneau, Alaska. On June 9, 2016, a wreckage examination and layout were done under the direction of the NTSB IIC. Also present were an ASI from the FAA Juneau FSDO, an air safety investigator from Airbus, an air safety investigator from Safran, and three representatives from TEMSCO. During the examination, no preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures with the airframe and engine were noted. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter was being used to transport personnel and equipment in support of a power line construction project. The helicopter departed the landing zone (LZ) and transported two linemen from one power line tower to another using a 50 ft long line. When the linemen detached from the long line, the helicopter proceeded to the east where it hovered for 2 to 3 minutes. The linemen requested that the helicopter return to the tower to pick up equipment and then return to the LZ. The helicopter approached the tower, and, when the long line was nearing their reach, the linemen noticed the helicopter's sound change, and it descended suddenly. The helicopter veered to the right away from the tower, and the main rotor blades slowed noticeably as the helicopter descended into the trees and impacted terrain. The linemen climbed down from the tower and heard the helicopter's engine still producing noise, so one of them pulled the emergency fuel shutoff valve and turned the battery off. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed damage to the main rotor blades and main rotor hub consistent with sudden stoppage at low rotor rpm. The tail rotor exhibited damage consistent with no rotation during impact. The engine was removed from the airframe and connected to an engine test stand for a functional test, but it would not start after several attempts. The power turbine governor (PTG) was removed, and its main drive shaft was found fractured. The original PTG was replaced with a new PTG. With the new PTG installed, the engine started normally, produced rated horsepower, and met production test specifications with no anomalies noted. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the PTG revealed that a portion of the drive shaft remained embedded in the spindle of the spool bearing assembly. The fracture surface features of the shaft were consistent with overstress. The internal elements of the spool bearing assembly were seized and would not rotate. The ball bearings and spacers were found coated with voluminous, powdery, black particulate consistent with oxidized metallic wear debris, and no grease was observed. The ball retainers were fragmented, the inner surfaces were found coated with a powdery, black particulate consistent with oxidized metallic wear debris, and no grease was observed. The inner bearing surfaces were rough and frosted, consistent with three-body abrasive wear. The examination indicated that the fractured PTG drive shaft was the result of a spool bearing that seized due to a lack of lubrication. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn 2008, a service bulletin (SB) and commercial engine bulletin (CEB) were issued by PTG and engine manufacturers, respectively, that called for replacement of the dual-spool bearing, the type installed in the accident PTG, with a single-spool bearing. The dual-spool bearing had experienced 23 previous failures that had led to either engine oscillations, uncommanded engine acceleration, or a loss of engine power. Although the SB and CEB called for replacement of the accident PTG's dual-spool bearing not later than 750 hours after the PTG was installed new, the accident PTG had accumulated 1,048.7 hours since new when the accident occurred, and the SB and CEB had not been completed. As stated in the operator's Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved operations specifications, the operator was required to comply with FAA Airworthiness Directives but was not required to comply with manufacturer's service bulletins. It is likely that had the SB and CEB been completed, the PTG would not have failed and the engine would not have lost power.",
    "FactualNarrative": "14 CFR Part 133 Operations Specifications&#x0D;\nThe Operations Specifications for Rotor Blade, LLC, as approved by the FAA, states:&#x0D;\nThe owner or operator of the aircraft identified in the certificate holder or operator' s aircraft listing is primarily responsible for maintaining that aircraft in an airworthy condition as required by 14 CFR 91.403(a) and Part 39.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPTG Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the component maintenance manual, the model AL-AA2 PTG is an element of the engine fuel controlling system. The function of the governor is to maintain the speed of the power turbine (N2) by resetting the main fuel control; the PTG supplements the main fuel control. This resetting establishes the gas producer speed (N1) required to supply N2. The PTG is mounted on the accessory case and senses N2 speed through reduction gearing. When an N2 off-speed condition is sensed by the PTG, it supplies a signal to the fuel control to change N1 speed to eliminate the off-speed condition. A complete description of the PTG is available in the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn 2003, Honeywell introduced a dual-spool bearing for the PTG to lower cost of ownership and commonize the design. The bearing installed in the accident PTG was the dual-spool bearing. The dual-spool bearing replaced the legacy design single-spool bearing; the legacy design had no previous service issues. Honeywell reported that the dual-spool bearing had experienced a total of 23 field failures before this accident. The spool bearing failures led to either engine oscillations, uncommanded engine acceleration, or a loss of engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHoneywell Service Bulletin (SB) GT-73-344&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHoneywell issued SB GT-73-344, Revision 2, on October 30, 2008, to replace the bearing assembly on PTGs used on Rolls-Royce 250 series engines in order to increase PTG reliability. The SB applied to several PTG models including the AL-AA2 model on the accident engine. Revision 1 was issued March 7, 2008.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRolls-Royce Commercial Engine Bulletin (CEB) 1402&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRolls-Royce issued CEB 1402 on April 21, 2008, to increase PTG reliability by incorporating a new bearing assembly. The CEB referenced Honeywell SB GT-73-344 and specified compliance times. The SB and CEB were issued after the accident PTG was installed new, and the SB and CEB were applicable to it. According to the CEB compliance times, the accident PTG's dual-spool bearing should have been replaced with a single-spool bearing no later than 750 hours TT since new.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs a result of this investigation, Rolls-Royce issued a Commercial Service Letter (CSL), revision 1, on November 11, 2016, to remind customers that there are engines operating in the field that have not complied with CEB 1402 and other CEBs. The CSL recommends that customers should review the referenced CEBs to determine if they are applicable to their engine. The CSL also states: \"Rolls--Royce has been involved in investigations where failure of the user to comply with the identified bulletins resulted in an uncommanded engine power reduction. It is the owner/operator's sole responsibility to comply with the identified bulletins within the specified timeframe or risk a potential for loss of aircraft or loss of life. Rolls-Royce is not responsible for an owner/operator's failure to comply.\" - The MD 369E features a fully articulated five-bladed main rotor system with anti-torque provided by a four-bladed semi-rigid tail rotor. The helicopter was configured to be flown from the left pilot seat (figure 3).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3 – Preaccident photograph of the helicopter&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter had accumulated 7,688.4 hours total time (TT) at the time of the accident. A review of the maintenance records revealed an annual inspection was completed on December 4, 2015, at 7,522.6 hours TT. At the time of the accident, the engine, a Roll-Royce 250-C20B, had accumulated 1,048.7 hours TT since new. On April 3, 2016, at 987.4 hours engine TT, a 150-hour engine inspection was completed, and a fuel control tube was replaced. Also replaced during the maintenance work were the engine combustion case, combustion liner, and engine bleed valve due to a power transient over-temperature of 850°C for 2 seconds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn April 16, 2016, an inoperative power turbine speed (N2) dual tachometer was replaced. On April 26, 2016, a video was taken of the dual tachometer as the helicopter was in flight, and it showed that the dual tachometer indicated about 475 rotor rpm and about 60% N2 rpm. The Rotor Blade ground crewman who took the video stated that the pilot wanted him to send the video to a Rotor Blade mechanic to show him that there was still an issue with the dual tachometer. The Rotor Blade mechanic stated that he watched the video, but it was not sent directly to him. He stated that he told the pilot not to fly the helicopter if there was a problem. The mechanic and the pilot discussed that it was likely only an indicating issue.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was installed new on the helicopter on November 21, 2007. The engine's accessories, including power turbine governor (PTG) model AL-AA2, part number 2549170-1, serial number HR48214, were installed new with 0.0 hours TT. No records indicated any maintenance completed on the PTG after initial installation. The records revealed that all applicable Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Airworthiness Directives had been completed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeight and balance calculations for the helicopter revealed that the center of gravity was within limits, the gross weight at the time of the accident was 2,097 lbs, and the maximum gross weight was 3,550 lbs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator was authorized by the FAA to conduct class A, B, and C external load operations. The helicopter was equipped with an Onboard Systems hydraulic hook kit and Rotor Blade, LLC, H500 side hook assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 3, 2016, the company fuel truck was fueled with 211.3 gallons of Jet-A at MTW. The fuel logs revealed that, before the 0800 departure from the LZ, the helicopter was refueled at the fuel truck and departed with 260 lbs of fuel. Before the final departure at 0949, the helicopter was refueled and departed with 240 lbs (35.29 gallons) of fuel, which was estimated to provide 1 hour 10 minutes of flight time. - On May 4, 2016, at 1002 central daylight time, an MD Helicopters 369E helicopter, N629JK, impacted trees and terrain near Reedsville, Wisconsin. The commercial-rated pilot, who was the sole occupant, was fatally injured, and the helicopter sustained substantial damage. The helicopter was registered to Padgett Ag Air, LLC, Pawleys Island, South Carolina, and operated by Rotor Blade, LLC Georgetown, South Carolina, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 133 as an external load operation. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan was filed. The flight departed from the Manitowoc County Airport (MTW), Manitowoc, Wisconsin, about 0730.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was being used to transport personnel and equipment in support of a power line construction project to replace a shield wire with a fiber optic cable. The project began on March 10, 2016, with a basic helicopter and landing zone (LZ) safety course provided by Rotor Blade for the construction employees. The project had continued without interruption except for weather delays. On the morning of the accident, the helicopter arrived at the LZ about 0800. Two job briefings were conducted, and the helicopter was to transport linemen, equipment, and materials to various power line tower structures that were about 125 ft tall using a 50 ft long line attached to the cargo hook. The helicopter flew from 0842 to 0906 and then returned to the LZ.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0949, the helicopter departed the LZ and transported two linemen from tower 9903 to the neighboring tower, 9904 (figure 1). When the linemen detached from the long line, the helicopter proceeded to the east and hovered for 2 to 3 minutes. The linemen requested that the helicopter come back to tower 9904 to pick up equipment and return to the LZ. The helicopter approached the tower from the southwest and faced northeast into the wind as the linemen presented hand signals to the pilot. The linemen stated that the end of the long line was about 20 ft laterally and 15 ft vertically from their reach when they noticed the helicopter's sound change and it descended suddenly. The helicopter veered to the right away from the tower, and the main rotor blades slowed noticeably. The helicopter continued into the trees and terrain south of the tower. The linemen climbed down from the tower and heard the helicopter's engine still producing noise. One lineman pulled the emergency fuel shutoff valve and turned off the battery.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 – Google Earth overview of the accident area with GPS track downloaded from Garmin 496 onboard helicopter&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo other project employees were about 150 yards north of tower 9904 (figure 2); they stated that, as the helicopter approached tower 9904 for the final time, the main rotor blades slowed down, the engine sound decreased, and the helicopter veered right toward the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2 – View from project employee witness location, facing south toward tower 9904 - Manitowoc County Coroner's Office, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, completed an autopsy on the pilot, and the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head and chest. The pilot was wearing an MSA LH250 flight helmet during the accident. The Bioaeronautical Research Laboratory at the FAA's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute conducted toxicology testing, which revealed the presence of amlodipine and atorvastatin and was negative for other substances.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAmlodipine (brand name Norvasc) is a prescription medication used to treat high blood pressure. Atorvastatin (brand name Lipitor) is a prescription medication used for lowering high blood cholesterol. The pilot had previously reported these medications to the FAA. - The pilot's logbooks were not found during the course of the investigation. Company flight log reports revealed that the pilot flew the accident helicopter from March 8 to May 3, 2016, for a total of 67 hours. The pilot also flew the accident helicopter for an estimated 2.5 hours on the morning of the accident. - The engine was shipped to a Rolls-Royce facility and connected to an engine test stand for a functional test. Several attempts to start the engine were made, but the engine did not start. The fuel system was checked, and fuel was noted throughout the system, up to and including the fuel nozzle where normal spray patterns and pressures were observed. The fuel control unit was removed and replaced with a new fuel control unit; subsequent engine start attempts were unsuccessful. The governor servo pressure (Py) line between the PTG and fuel control unit was removed, and its fittings were capped off to test operation of the PTG. A successful engine start was made in this condition. The PTG was removed, and its main drive shaft was found fractured. The original PTG was replaced with a new PTG, and the original fuel control was reinstalled on the engine. With the new PTG installed, the engine started normally, produced rated horsepower, and met production test specifications with no anomalies noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn August 9, 2016, the PTG, which was designed and manufactured by Honeywell, was disassembled and examined at a Honeywell facility under the auspices of the NTSB. A functional performance test could not be performed due to the internal damage. The examination revealed that the governor pressure (Pg) lever clevis fork was bent, and the spool bearing assembly was loose within the drive body cavity (figure 6). The drive shaft guide post was fractured and trapped within the spool bearing bushing. Metallic debris was found within the interior of both the drive body and the drive body cover. The internal bearing elements of the spool bearing assembly were seized and would not rotate. One flyweight was bent and did not pivot freely. The drive shaft was found fractured at the guide post and at the drive spline. The PTG was sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory, Washington, DC, for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 6 – Internal view of the PTG&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 16, 2016, the NTSB examination of the PTG revealed that a portion of the fractured drive shaft remained embedded in the spindle of the spool bearing assembly. The fracture surface features of the shaft were consistent with overstress. The outer cap of the spool bearing assembly was removed, and the ball bearings and spacers were found coated with voluminous, powdery, black particulate. Much of the powder fell from the assembly upon removal of the cap. No grease was observed. Disassembly of the bearings revealed that the ball retainers were fragmented, the inner surfaces were found coated with a powdery, black particulate, and no grease was observed. The inner bearing surfaces were rough and frosted. Figure 7 shows the disassembled pieces of the spool bearing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 7 – Disassembled spool bearing with labels - The helicopter came to rest in a wooded area about 125 ft south of tower 9904 (figure 4/5). The surrounding trees were 50 to 75 ft tall, and several of them were broken or showed signs of recent scaring and damage, consistent with the helicopter's impact sequence. All of the major components of the helicopter were found at the accident site. The long line remained attached to the cargo hook and trailed north toward the tower. There was an odor of Jet-A fuel around the main wreckage, and fuel was observed leaking from the helicopter. On-scene documentation was completed, and the wreckage was recovered to a secure examination facility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4 – The accident helicopter surrounded by trees&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5 – Front view of accident helicopter damage&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 5, 2016, a postaccident examination of the wreckage was completed by the investigation team. The main transmission and its mounting revealed no exterior impact damage. The transmission fluid level was verified full using the sight glass. The upper and lower transmission chip detectors were removed and were clear of debris. The gearbox was rotated by hand and exhibited movement to indicate that the transmission internal gearing and the main rotor drive shaft were continuous. The engine drive shaft remained connected at both ends and appeared undamaged. Drive continuity from the engine to the main rotor and tail rotor output pinion was verified. The overrunning clutch was found to be functional.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll five main rotor blades remained attached to the hub and were cut or removed during the examination. The blades exhibited impact damage with minimal signatures of preimpact rotation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft section of the tail boom was fractured and remained attached by the electrical conduit and wiring. The forward section of the tail boom remained attached to the fuselage. There was no evidence of a main rotor blade strike to the tail boom. The tail rotor gearbox and tail rotor swashplate operated smoothly when rotated by hand. The tail rotor gearbox chip detector was clear of debris. The tail rotor blades were manipulated by hand, and the control linkages and mechanisms responded appropriately. The right horizontal stabilizer was crushed inward.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLateral cyclic control continuity was established through the main rotor head. Longitudinal cyclic control continuity was established to the fractures in the interconnecting torque tube and one-way lock attachment. Beyond the fractures, control continuity was established to the rotor head. The trim actuators were near center position. The actuators could not be electrically tested due to circuit breaker damage. The trim actuators were removed, and the actuators measured between mounting centers. Collective control continuity was established through the main rotor head. Anti-torque control continuity was established from the upper control column bellcrank to the control mechanism fractures under the cockpit floor and back to the fracture in the tail rotor control tube. All breaks in control continuity were consistent with impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument console and slant panel were still in place but sustained damage primarily on the right side of the slant panel that housed the circuit breaker panel. Although several circuit breaker housings were cracked and some circuit breakers did not appear to reset properly, battery power was applied to evaluate the caution/warning panel lights. The caution/warning lights were functionally tested and illuminated when the push-to-test button was depressed. The engine out warning functioned normally. The trim motors and N2 beep did not function due to impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn engine fuel vacuum check was performed and revealed a slow leak on the engine side; the system held vacuum on the airframe side. No vacuum check isolation procedure was performed on the engine side since the engine was removed for additional examination. The fuel start pump inlets and the fuel tank sump area were found clean and unobstructed. Fuel was noted within the fuel pump inlet port and at the fuel nozzle. The fuel sender electrical wire was verified to be wrapped around the fuel line preventing interference with the fuel gauge sending unit. About 6 gallons of fuel were drained from the fuel tank sump. The fuel appeared clean with no contaminants observed. The low fuel warning light was functional.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine and accessories exhibited minimal external damage, and the engine mounts appeared undamaged. All pneumatic, oil, and fuel lines displayed no damage or evidence of leakage, and all \"B\" nut connectors were at least finger tight. The compressor inlet and visible stages of blades and vanes revealed no evidence of foreign object debris damage. Upon removal of the engine from the airframe, manual rotation of the gas generator drive train revealed that it was rotationally free and continuous from the starter generator pad to the compressor. Manual rotation of the power turbine drive train revealed that it to be free and continuous from the power take off gear to the stage four turbine wheel. The upper and lower engine chip detectors were clear of debris. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot and four passengers departed in the helicopter on a local air tour flight. A witness observed the helicopter at a low altitude in a descent and noted that it sounded unusual. He then heard the engine go silent, which was followed by sounds associated with impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter initially impacted trees near the top of a ridge at an elevation of about 1,100 ft mean sea level and came to rest in a wooded area near the bottom of the ridge. The main wreckage was mostly consumed by a postcrash fire. The main and tail rotor blades exhibited signatures of low rotational energy consistent with unpowered ground impact damage. Disassembly of the engine fuel pump revealed anomalous and accelerated spline wear that was severe enough to prevent the fuel pump from delivering fuel to the engine, resulting in a total loss of engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wear on the splines was likely accelerated due to a lack of grease. Remnant material on the fuel pump splines was consistent with grease being present at some time on the drive gear and drive shaft splined connection, but it could not be determined if it was from the last overhaul which was performed about 8 years and 1,078 flight hours before the accident or from an earlier overhaul. Drive gear spline impressions on the drive shaft spacer were consistent with an erroneously selected spacer. The incorrectly-sized spacer could have resulted in a gap between the spacer and drive gear that provided a path for grease that was applied on the splines to escape. According to records from the most recent fuel pump overhaul and the overhaul facility, the spacer was not replaced during the last overhaul. Because overhaul records preceding the most recent fuel pump overhaul were not available, it could not be determined when the incorrectly-sized spacer was introduced into the fuel pump assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing an inflight loss of engine power, an autorotative landing can be accomplished if the pilot successfully enters the autorotation, the helicopter has adequate altitude and airspeed, and rotor rpm is managed throughout the autorotative descent. The lack of crash-resistant data and cockpit image recorders, radar data, or surveillance videos precluded determination as to why the pilot was not able to successfully complete an autorotation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on the described injuries in the autopsy reports, the accident was likely survivable for the pilot and one passenger had they received immediate emergency treatment and not been subject to a postcrash fire. One of the passengers would not have survived based on their injuries. The investigation was unable to determine whether two of the passengers would have been able to survive their injuries had they not been subject to a postcrash fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped, nor was it required to be equipped, with a crash resistant fuel system. Crash resistant fuel systems are intended to reduce the risk of fuel spillage and provide additional egress time for occupants. At the time of the accident, a modification to the accident make and model helicopter was available from the manufacturer (at a cost) to incorporate a fuel system with improved crash resistance. This modification was not certified to the current airworthiness standards but was tested to similar standards and would have improved the crash resistance of the helicopter's fuel system. Due to the lack of recorded data, such as a flight data recorder or videos capturing the crash, the conditions at the time of impact, such as helicopter attitude and airspeed, are unknown. Therefore, the effectiveness of a crash resistant fuel system, either one that met the current airworthiness standards or the available manufacturer modification, in preventing a postcrash fire could not be determined in this investigation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Fuel Pump Overhaul&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA discussion with IGS personnel about their overall experiences with overhaul of the fuel pump revealed that they had seen wear similar to the accident fuel pump drive shaft spline wear but not to the severity of the wear observed on the drive shaft from the accident fuel pump. An IGS mechanic who specialized in overhauling fuel pumps similar to the one on the accident helicopter stated that he had seen drive shaft spline wear \"about 4 or 5 times\" since 2008, and a lack of lubricant or corrosion was associated with the spline wear. Additionally, the IGS mechanic stated he had only observed wear on the smaller splines of the drive shaft and had not observed wear on the larger splines of the drive shaft (the splines that mate to the engine accessory gearbox drive gear). According to IGS, fuel pumps that are submitted for overhaul are visually examined for evidence of spline or gear tooth wear; if wear is observed, the part is rejected.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel System Crash Resistance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn October 3, 1994, the FAA introduced improved fuel system crash resistance standards for normal category helicopters via Amendment 27-30 to Part 27 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. The standards for fuel system crash resistance, 14 CFR 27.952, are intended to minimize fuel spillage near ignition sources in order to increase the evacuation time available for crew and passengers to escape a postcrash fire. The improved crash resistance standards were not retroactively applicable to either existing helicopters or newly manufactured helicopters whose certification basis and approval predated the effectivity of Amendment 27-30.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Bell 206L model was type certificated in September 1975 under type certificate data sheet No. H2SW. The accident helicopter was not manufactured, nor was it required to be manufactured, with a fuel system meeting the provisions of 14 CFR 27.952. According to Bell Helicopter, the 206L helicopter was originally equipped with a thin-wall bladder-type fuel cell. These original fuel bladders were not nor were they required to be drop-tested. Additionally, although frangible structural interfaces were used at major interfaces, such as the filler cap adapter, the vent and fuel feed lines were rigid tubes. In March 1994, Bell Helicopter released Service Instruction No. BHT-206-SI-2043 to improve the crash resistance of the original fuel system for 206L and 206L-1 helicopters via incorporation of a retrofit kit. While this retrofit kit was not certified to the provisions of 14 CFR 27.952, it introduced fuel bladders with a higher puncture resistance than the original fuel bladders, replacement of rigid interconnect tubes with stainless steel braided hoses, and frangible structural attachments to the fuel bladders. Additionally, the improved fuel bladders were drop-tested at 80% capacity from a height of 50 ft. According to Bell Helicopter, the retrofit kit has been available since 1994, but they did not have a record of selling one of these retrofit kits. A review of the helicopter's maintenance history revealed no record of modifications to the original fuel system to improve its crash resistance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutorotation Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Rotorcraft Flying Handbook, \"…an autorotation is a descending maneuver where the engine is disengaged from the main rotor system and the rotor blades are driven solely by the upward flow of air through the rotor. In other words, the engine is no longer supplying power to the main rotor. The most common reason for an autorotation is an engine failure…At the instant of engine failure, the main rotor blades are producing lift and thrust from their angle of attack and velocity. By immediately lowering collective pitch, which must be done in case of an engine failure, lift and drag are reduced, and the helicopter begins an immediate descent, thus producing an upward flow of air through the rotor system…\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Bell 206L rotorcraft flight manual states that in the event of an engine failure in flight, an autorotation should be performed by adjusting collective pitch control to maintain a main rotor speed of 90-107% rpm and cyclic control to obtain the desired autorotative airspeed for the condition (with a stated \"normal autorotation airspeed\" of 70 mph or 61 knots). - The seven-seat helicopter was manufactured in 1977 and issued an FAA standard airworthiness certificate in the normal category on March 1, 1977. It was equipped with a two-blade main rotor system and a two-blade tail rotor system that were powered by a 420-horsepower Rolls-Royce (formerly Allison) 250-C20B turboshaft engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of maintenance information revealed that, at the time of the accident, the helicopter had accumulated about 22,562 total hours, and the engine had accumulated about 8,550 total hours. The helicopter had been operated for about 40 hours since its most recent 100-hour and annual inspections, which were signed-off concurrently on March 4, 2016.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to engine records, the engine fuel pump, model number 386500-5, serial number T103542, was manufactured by the Power Accessories Division of TRW, Inc., later known as Argo-Tech Corporation and now a part of Eaton Corporation. The fuel pump was installed on the engine on June 23, 2009, at an engine total time of 7,472.0 flight hours. A maintenance record entry stated that, at the time of installation, the fuel pump had 0 flight hours since overhaul. Based on the engine total time at the time of the accident, the fuel pump had accumulated about 1,078 flight hours since its last overhaul. According to the Rolls-Royce M250-C20 series maintenance manual, the fuel pump had an overhaul interval of 4,000 hours. Before installation on the accident engine, the fuel pump was overhauled at International Governor Services (IGS) in Broomfield, Colorado. The IGS work order stated that the pump was overhauled in accordance with Argo-Tech Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) No. 73-10-10, revision 0, dated November 2000. Signed-off inspections in the work order included dimensional checks; fluorescent penetrant inspection of the filter housing, bypass filter housing, pump cover, and gear housing assembly; and magnetic particle inspection of the main drive shaft, drive gear, and driven gear. No anomalous findings were recorded in these inspections. - The helicopter was not equipped nor was it required to be equipped with any crash-resistant data or image recorders. - On April 4, 2016, about 1610 eastern daylight time, a Bell 206L, N16760, was destroyed when it impacted terrain while maneuvering following a loss of engine power in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. The commercial pilot and four passengers were fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to a private individual and operated by Great Smoky Mountain Helicopters, Inc., doing business as Smoky Mountain Helicopters as a Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 local air tour flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed for the flight that departed Sixty Six Heliport (6TN3), Sevierville, Tennessee, about 1600.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the helicopter had been purchased in 1986 for air tour/sightseeing purposes. At the time of the accident, the operator owned two helicopters, a Bell 206B that was based in Cherokee, North Carolina, and the accident helicopter, which was based at 6TN3.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA company pilot reported that he flew the helicopter on an estimated 10 local sightseeing flights on the morning of the accident. The accident pilot took over from him between 1300 and 1400 and completed 5 sightseeing flights in the helicopter before the accident flight. The company pilot reported that he checked the helicopter's fuel level before the departure of the accident flight, and the fuel level was \"just below the 6-inch line,\" which corresponded to about 300 pounds of fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot of another helicopter operating in the area about the time of the accident reported that he did not hear any distress calls. He further stated that he heard the accident pilot make a normal landmark position report over \"wonderworks.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness who lived near the accident site reported that he was outside when he observed the helicopter at a low altitude in a descent and that it \"didn't sound right.\" He further described the sound as if \"the engine was wound tight\" and it \"lost the rotor sound.\" He then heard the engine go silent, \"as if the pilot cut the power,\" which was followed by sounds associated with impact. Another witness reported hearing the impact and seeing the accident site engulfed in fire. - The Regional Forensic Center Knox County, Knoxville, Tennessee, performed autopsies on the pilot and the four passengers. According to the autopsy reports, all five helicopter occupants suffered blunt force injuries, but three of the five died primarily from thermal injuries; one died as a result of combined thermal and blunt force injuries (pilot); and one died as a result of blunt force injuries. [For additional information pertaining to the occupants' injuries, see the NTSB Injury Factual Report in the public docket for this investigation.]&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing performed by the FAA Bioaeronautical Science Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on specimens obtained from the pilot were negative for all tested drugs. - The 1615 weather observation at Gatlinburg-Pigeon Forge Airport (GKT), Sevierville, Tennessee, located about 3 nautical miles northeast of the accident site, reported wind from 220° at 10 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, clear skies, temperature 24°C, dew point 2°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.93 inches of mercury. - According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airmen records, the pilot held commercial pilot and flight instructor certificates with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument-helicopter. He reported a total flight experience of 550 hours, with 300 hours accumulated during the preceding 6 months on the application for his most recent FAA second-class medical certificate, which was issued on April 21, 2015.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to company records, the pilot was hired in April 2015. He satisfactorily completed a factory Bell Helicopter 206L pilot transition course on April 10, 2015 and received a logbook endorsement that noted satisfactory completion of a flight review in accordance with 14 CFR section 61.56 on that date. Review of the pilot's logbook revealed that, as of March 25, 2016, he had logged about 1,310 hours of total flight experience, which included about 875 hours in Bell 206-series helicopters. According to the operator's helicopter log, the pilot flew the accident helicopter on several occasions between March 25 and the accident flight; however, the flight time that was accumulated by the pilot during these flights could not be determined. - The helicopter impacted trees near the top of a ridge that was about 1,100 ft mean sea level (msl). The main wreckage was found on its left side on a heading of about 340° magnetic in a wooded area near the bottom of a ridge. An initial tree strike was identified about 405 ft south of the main wreckage on top of the ridge at an elevation of about 1,100 ft mean sea level. Pieces of Plexiglas and the front-left piece of skid tube were found in the immediate vicinity of the initial tree strike. The primary debris path began at the top of the ridge and extended down to the main wreckage at the bottom of the ridge. The main wreckage was mostly consumed by a postcrash fire, and the entire area surrounding the main wreckage was charred. All major structural components of the helicopter were located at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe and Rotor Systems&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe upper portion of the main fuselage with the engine and main transmission still attached was resting on its left side and exhibited crush damage. The midsection of the tail boom, including the horizontal stabilizer, was found separated but immediately aft of the main wreckage. The left horizontal stabilizer was fractured about mid-span. The outboard portion of the left horizontal stabilizer and the vertical fin were found at the top of the ridge, about 110 ft south of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit instruments were observed ahead of the main fuselage along the debris path. The instruments exhibited thermal distress. The caution and warning panel (CWP) was observed behind the main fuselage along the debris path, and it also exhibited thermal distress. Subsequent X-ray examination of the CWP was conducted at the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC, to assess the condition of the individual light bulb filaments. The examination found that several of the bulb globes were melted due to thermal exposure; all of the lights had filaments present; and all of the filaments were visible in the X-ray. Several of the filaments were broken, but none of the bulbs demonstrated hot coil filament stretching. These findings were consistent with none of the lights being illuminated at impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne main rotor blade was found near the main fuselage and remained attached to the main rotor hub. The root end of the second main rotor blade remained attached to the main rotor hub and was partially embedded into the ground. The remainder of the second blade was found forward of the main fuselage in the debris path. The tips of both main rotor blades exhibited fractures. Pieces of the fractured blade tip from the second main rotor blade were found behind the ridge, about 330 ft south-southeast of the main wreckage and near the location of the initial tree strike. The leading edges of both blades did not exhibit evidence consistent with impact damage with high rotational energy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nManual rotation of the main rotor blades in the direction opposite of normal rotation resulted in the rotation of the main rotor shaft, the engine-to-main transmission drive shaft, the engine's No. 4 turbine wheel, and the tail rotor drive output shaft. Freewheeling functionality was confirmed by manual rotation of the main rotor blades in the direction of normal rotation, which resulted in no rotation of the engine's No. 4 turbine wheel. The flexible couplings between the drive shaft flanges were intact and did not display evidence of fractures or deformation consistent with power at impact. The tail rotor gearbox remained mounted to a section of tail boom that was separated and located about 40 ft southeast of the main wreckage. Manual rotation of the tail rotor blades resulted in rotation of the gearbox input. The splines at the tail rotor gearbox did not exhibit evidence of fractures or smearing. Subsequent removal of the chip detectors from the main transmission and tail rotor gearbox revealed no evidence of large ferrous particles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth main rotor pitch links were fractured about mid-length, and both ends of each link remained attached to the corresponding blade pitch horn and the rotating swashplate; the fractures exhibited signatures consistent with overload. The rotating and stationary swashplates remained installed on the main rotor shaft. The idler lever assembly remained attached to the rotating swashplate and the main rotor shaft. The collective lever assembly remained attached to the swashplate sleeve assembly and the main rotor control support assembly (mounted on top of the main transmission housing). Control linkages remained attached between the control mixing unit and both the stationary swashplate and the collective lever. Control linkages from the control mixing unit to the hydraulic actuators were fractured and thermally distressed but remained connected at their clevis ends. The three hydraulic actuators (left cyclic, right cyclic, and collective) were found mounted to the airframe, but their aft mounts were fractured. The hydraulic actuators and their airframe mounts exhibited evidence of heat distress. Hydraulic lines remained connected to the three hydraulic actuators but were broken in multiple areas. The hydraulic pump remained mounted to the main transmission.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe collective control stick and the collective jackshaft were found loose within the wreckage near the main fuselage and exhibited thermal distress. The cyclic stick was not recovered at the accident site. The base of the cyclic (into which the cyclic stick is installed) was observed loose within the wreckage and exhibited thermal distress.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to impact damage and the extensive postcrash fire, the helicopter's seats and restraint system could not be evaluated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained installed on the airframe. The left side of the engine casing and the left exhaust port exhibited crush damage. The first stage compressor did not exhibit evidence of hard or soft body impact damage but exhibited evidence of sooting. No evidence of scoring was observed between the first stage compressor blades and blade track. The 4th stage turbine wheel was visible through the exhaust port, and its blades did not exhibit visible impact damage. The gas producer fuel control remained installed on the engine accessory gearbox, and the indicator was observed to be in the 0° (\"cut off\") position. The power turbine governor and engine fuel pump remained installed on the engine accessory gearbox. Subsequent disassembly of the core engine, which was comprised of the compressor section, combustion section, turbine section, and an accessory gearbox, did not reveal any anomalous damage that would have precluded normal engine operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel Pump&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine fuel pump was removed from the engine accessory gearbox and disassembled. Removal of the drive shaft revealed that its small splines, which are normally mated to the internal splines of the fuel pump drive gear, exhibited evidence of severe damage, with significant portions of the spline teeth missing material. The drive shaft spacer exhibited thermal distress and indentations consistent with contact with the internal splines of the drive gear (see Figure 1).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Anomalous spline damage observed on the small splines of the drive shaft (red arrows) and indentations observed on the drive shaft spacer (yellow arrows).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRemnant pieces consistent with the retaining clip, which is normally installed on the spline relief on the drive shaft small splines, were not observed during disassembly but were later identified via photographs taken during the examination (see Figure 2).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Figure 2. Remnant pieces consistent with the retaining clip (red arrow).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe internal splines of the drive gear also exhibited evidence of severe damage, with significant portions of the spline teeth missing material (see Figure 3).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Figure 3. Anomalous spline damage observed on the internal splines (red arrows).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther examination of the disassembled fuel pump components was performed at the NTSB Materials Laboratory, Washington, DC. The hardness and material composition of the drive shaft and drive gear met required specifications. Remnant material on the drive shaft and drive gear splines were similar to mineral-oil-based/soap-thickened lubricants.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe illustrated parts list for the fuel pump found in the CMM allowed for 11 different drive shaft spacers of different sizing. According to the CMM, measurements taken during assembly of the drive shaft to the pump assembly are used to select proper drive shaft spacer thickness. The drive shaft spacer installed on the accident fuel pump drive shaft was consistent with a P/N 215981-8 spacer, about 0.240 inches thick (see Figure 4). According to the original build record from the manufacture of the fuel pump, dated September 1985, a spacer with a thickness of 0.120 inches was originally installed. Records of fuel pump overhaul preceding the last overhaul were not available, and it could not be determined whether other spacer sizes were used throughout the operational history of the accident fuel pump. In addition, it could not be determined whether the drive shaft, drive gear, and driven gear were original to the fuel pump or, if previously replaced, when the replacement occurred.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. The drive shaft spacer installed on the drive shaft (red bracket).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n[For additional details of the metallography performed on the accident fuel pump components, see NTSB Materials Lab Factual Report No. 17-016 in the docket for this investigation.] -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was flying the helicopter from his home base to an airport that he was familiar with; he had flown the route multiple times in the past 2 years in the accident helicopter and in his airplane. Although he had an airplane instrument rating, he did not have a helicopter instrument rating, and the helicopter was not certificated for instrument flight. Before the flight, the pilot reviewed the weather conditions and forecast with his son, who was also a pilot; however, he did not receive an official weather briefing from a flight service station. Although instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the area at the time the pilots reviewed the weather, the forecast was for conditions to improve by the time the pilot intended to arrive.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight departed in visual meteorological conditions and proceeded to the north. About 40 minutes into the flight, 10 miles south of the destination airport, the helicopter climbed sharply as it approached a ridgeline and entered the clouds. It then completed a 330° left turn, slowed, and climbed again, before reversing course and entering an uncontrolled descent into terrain. Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed extensive impact damage, although there was no evidence of a preimpact failure or malfunction with the flight controls, drive line, structure, or the engine. The pilot was not instrument rated in helicopters, the helicopter was not equipped for flight in instrument meteorological conditions and the flight had inadvertently entered the clouds, all of which are conditions conducive to spatial disorientation. The vertical and horizontal maneuvering in the clouds was inconsistent with the intended rout of flight, and likely due to spatial disorientation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Spatial Disorientation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute's publication, \"Introduction to Aviation Physiology,\" defines spatial disorientation as a loss of proper bearings or a state of mental confusion as to position, location, or movement relative to the position of the earth. Factors contributing to spatial disorientation include changes in acceleration, flight in IMC, frequent transfer between visual meteorological conditions (VMC) and IMC, and unperceived changes in aircraft attitude. The publication states that pilots flying in IMC are more susceptible than usual to the stresses of flight, such as fatigue and anxiety, and any event that produces an emotional upset is likely to disrupt the pilot's mental processes, making them more vulnerable to illusions and false sensations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3A) describes some hazards associated with flying when the ground or horizon are obscured. The handbook states, in part: \"The vestibular sense (motion sensing by the inner ear) in particular tends to confuse the pilot. Because of inertia, the sensory areas of the inner ear cannot detect slight changes in the attitude of the airplane, nor can they accurately sense attitude changes that occur at a uniform rate over a period of time. On the other hand, false sensations are often generated; leading the pilot to believe the attitude of the airplane has changed when in fact, it has not. These false sensations result in the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation.\" - The four-seat, single-main-rotor, single-engine helicopter, serial number 1738, was manufactured in 2007. The helicopter was powered by a 260-horsepower Lycoming O-540-F1B5 series engine. The helicopter was not certificated for instrument flight rules operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of maintenance records revealed that the most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on July 1, 2015. At the time of the inspection, the airframe and engine had been operated for about 629 hours since new. The helicopter's total time on the day of the accident could not be determined due to impact and fire damage; however, the pilot had logged about 34 hours in the helicopter since the inspection. - The helicopter was not equipped with a flight recorder nor was it required to be. A portable GPS receiver was recovered from the accident site and forwarded to the NTSB Vehicle Recorder laboratory for examination. It captured GPS position and time data for the accident flight and several previous flights. More information is available in the public docket for this investigation. - On March 27, 2016, at 1147 eastern daylight time, a Robinson Helicopter R44, N776JM, was destroyed when it impacted terrain near Canadensis, Pennsylvania. The private pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to Sea Air Inc. and operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight. The flight departed Doylestown Airport (DYL), Doylestown, Pennsylvania, at 1109, destined for Mountain Bay Airpark (PA49), Greentown, Pennsylvania, about 60 miles to the north.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout the time of the accident, a witness was outside his home about 1/2-mile northwest of the accident site when he heard an aircraft engine overhead. The witness looked upward toward the sound, but the aircraft was obscured by clouds. He estimated the cloud height to be about 200 ft above the trees in his yard. The witness then heard a loud \"boom,\" similar to a car striking a tree, followed by another \"boom\" a few seconds later.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an on-board GPS; review of the recorded data revealed that, over the last 10 minutes of flight, the helicopter's altitude gradually increased. The increase in altitude corresponded with rising terrain. As the helicopter approached the crest of a ridge, the GPS altitude increased sharply to about 2,200 ft mean sea level (msl), or about 200-300 ft above ground level (agl) in the area of the ridge. At the time, the reported cloud ceiling was also about 2,200 ft msl.  The yellow arrows in Figures 1 and 2 indicate the climb and location of the ridge.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Altitude and Terrain Elevation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2. Ground Track&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter then descended slightly as it began a left 330° turn, then climbed again; the GPS altitude indicated that the helicopter was above the cloud ceiling (as depicted by the yellow data points in Figure 2). The helicopter then flew northwest for about 40 seconds as it continued to climb, while the ground speed decreased from about 70 knots to about 20 knots. The helicopter then reversed course briefly, and then made several changes in track direction and altitude,    before making a left 270° turn just before the last data point, which was about 135 ft north of the accident site at a GPS altitude of 2,678 ft msl, which was about 800 ft agl. - Forensic Pathology Associates, Allentown, Pennsylvania, conducted an autopsy on the pilot. The cause of death was determined to be \"multiple blunt force injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, conducted toxicological testing of specimens from the pilot. The results were positive for diltiazem and metoprolol, which are used to control blood pressure. Neither are considered to be impairing and the pilot had reported them during his most recent medical exam. The results were positive for ethanol that was consistent with postmortem production.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's family reported that on the morning of the accident, the pilot woke up dizzy with an elevated heart rate, but he felt well before the flight. - The closest reporting weather station to the accident site, Pocono Mountains Municipal Airport, Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, was located about 10 miles southwest of the accident site at an elevation of 1,915 ft. At 1153, the reported weather included an overcast ceiling at 300 ft agl with 7 statute miles of visibility. The wind was from 140° at 7 knots, the temperature was 4°C, the dew point was 3°C, and the altimeter setting was 30.31 inches of mercury. The station reported an overcast ceiling height of 200 ft agl from 0953 to 1118.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA weather computer model balloon sounding and satellite weather data for the accident area about 1100 showed clouds likely from near the surface through 4,000 ft msl. Weather radar animation for the accident area at the time of the accident showed no precipitation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe area forecast issued at 0445 and valid at the time of the helicopter's departure forecasted an overcast ceiling between 1,500 and 2,000 ft msl with cloud tops between 3,000 and 4,000 ft msl. However, the 0445 area forecast showed cloud ceiling conditions improving between 0800 and 1100, with the forecast expecting broken to scattered clouds between 1,500 and 2,500 ft msl. The forecast showed continued improving conditions between 1100 and 1400, with scattered clouds at 2,500 ft msl, a broken ceiling between 3,500 and 5,000 ft msl, and cloud tops at 6,000 ft msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBetween 0827 and 1045 a separate AIRMET was in effect for the accident area; it warned of mountain obscuration and IFR conditions due to clouds, fog, and mist along the flight route and at the accident site. An AIRMET issued at 1045 indicated mountain obscuration along the flight route due to clouds, precipitation, and mist was in effect for the accident area at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe weather conditions reported at DYL at an elevation of 394 ft msl, at 1054, which was about 15 minutes before the pilot departed were: variable wind at 3 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, an overcast ceiling at 1,700 ft agl, temperature 7°C, dew point 4°C.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's son, who was also a pilot, he had reviewed the weather conditions and forecast with the pilot on the morning of the accident. They were both aware of the low ceilings and forecast of improving conditions. They were satisfied that the conditions should be suitable for the flight. The pilot did not receive a weather briefing from a flight service station. - According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, rotorcraft helicopter, and instrument airplane. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued March 10, 2016. A review of the pilot's logbooks revealed that he had a total of 2,333 hours of flight experience, including 449 hours in rotorcraft, of which 345 hours were in the same make and model as the accident helicopter. He had logged 7 hours in the 3 months before the accident, 5 of which were in the accident helicopter. In the 24 months preceding the accident, he had flown from DYL to PA49 17 times in the accident helicopter and 7 times in his airplane. He had not logged any flight experience in actual or simulated instrument meteorological conditions during that period. - The helicopter impacted a wooded area about 100 yards north of an east-west oriented ridgeline, about 20 ft below the top of the ridge at an elevation of 2,000 ft msl. The wreckage path proceeded downhill along a heading of about 325° magnetic and was about 175 ft long. All major components of the helicopter were located at the accident site. The wreckage was significantly fragmented and partially consumed by a postcrash fire. Continuity from the controls to the main and tail rotor systems could not be confirmed due to impact and fire damage, however, all control rod ends were found in the wreckage path.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe throttle control linkages sustained impact and thermal damage. The linkage on the collective pitch control assembly was found in the full open position. The rod end at the carburetor control arm was fractured. The control arm was found beyond the full open position and the arm stop was separated from the carburetor. The mixture control knob and the control cable end (separated from the control arm) were found in the full rich position. The carburetor heat control linkage and slider valve were found in the on position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe empennage, tail rotor gearbox, and one tail rotor blade that was fractured near its root, were among the debris found closest to the initial impact area. The tail rotor gearbox rotated freely by hand. Both tail rotor blades exhibited leaded edge gouging. The engine, main rotor gearbox, and tailboom, were all separated from the fuselage and located along the wreckage path. The main rotor driveshaft was fracture-separated at the main rotor hub, consistent with overload. The driveshaft rotated freely by hand. Both main rotor blades remained attached to the hub and were significantly damaged by impact and fire. The fuselage components were fragmented and thermally damaged. All of the cockpit flight controls were found in the debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed fire and impact damage. The crankshaft was rotated by hand, and continuity was confirmed from the powertrain through the valvetrain to the accessory section. Valve continuity to the number 5 cylinder could not be confirmed due to impact damage to each pushrod. Compression was confirmed in all cylinders using thumb compression. Both magnetos were damaged by impact and fire and could not be actuated to produce spark. The spark plugs were intact and appeared consistent with the \"worn out – normal\" depiction on the Champion Check-A-Plug chart. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "After picking up a patient at a motor vehicle accident (MVA) site, the airline transport pilot of the helicopter air ambulance flight, which was operating under visual flight rules (VFR), departed in dark night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) to transport the patient to a hospital; a flight nurse and paramedic were also on board. Witness statements, video, and photographs indicated that reduced visibility in fog and mist as well as very-light-to-light precipitation existed at the MVA site, and the nearest weather station, 4 miles away, was reporting a 300-ft ceiling and 3 miles visibility. Radar data indicated that, after takeoff, the helicopter entered a left turn and climbed to 1,000 ft above mean sea level (msl). The rate of turn then began to increase, and, after reaching a peak altitude of 1,100 ft msl, the helicopter began a rapid descent that continued to ground impact. According to the radar data, the flight lasted about 1 minute. A search was initiated when the pilot did not check in with the communications center as required, and the wreckage was located the next morning about 1/2 mile from the departure location. Examination of the accident site and wreckage revealed that the helicopter struck trees and terrain and was highly fragmented. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal evidence of any preimpact malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the helicopter was not certificated for flight in IMC, it had sufficient instrumentation to operate in the event of an inadvertent encounter with IMC and was equipped with a helicopter terrain avoidance warning system, a night vision imaging system which included night vision goggles (NVGs), and an autopilot. The pilot had about 265 hours experience operating in IMC and had been trained in inadvertent IMC loss of control recovery, but he was not instrument current. Further, he had not been trained or qualified by the operator to fly in IMC. He was likely using NVGs during the flight as one of the first responders who helped load the patient into the helicopter saw the pilot wearing them. Based on the weather conditions, the flight path of the helicopter, and the lack of preimpact failures or anomalies, it is likely that the pilot experienced spatial disorientation after entering IMC and subsequently lost control of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTo accomplish operational control of its flights, the operator used an operational control center (OCC) that was staffed 24 hours a day by operational control coordinators. According to the operator, the pilot had the final authority and responsibility for decisions relating to safety of flight, and the operational control coordinators were responsible for confirming whether a flight or series of flights could be initiated, conducted, or terminated safely, in accordance with the authorizations, limitations, and procedures in their operations manual, and the applicable regulations. In the case of the accident flight, the operator's required VFR weather minimums were a 1,000-ft ceiling with a flight visibility of 3 miles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operational control coordinators' role was accomplished by inputting flight data into software programs that would perform automated database queries for pilot currency and aircraft maintenance information and would provide weather information based upon route of flight. Both OCC personnel and pilots had the authority to terminate a flight at any time if required conditions were not met. There were two personnel on duty before and during the time of the accident at the operator's OCC, a trainee operational control coordinator and a senior operational control coordinator. About 1 hour before the helicopter accident, the OCC received notification of the request for the helicopter to respond to the MVA, and the coordinators used a software program called \"OCC Helper\" to query weather information. Although the coordinates for the location of the MVA provided to the OCC were correct, the format of the coordinates was not the correct format for OCC Helper. Therefore, the OCC Helper software only recognized the MVA site as being near the helicopter's base, which was reporting visual meteorological conditions, and did not show the IMC being reported at weather stations closer to the MVA site. The trainee reported that latitude and longitude format was a common problem with OCC Helper and, at times, required OCC personnel to reformat the latitude and longitude coordinates to get the coordinates to work in OCC Helper. On the night of the accident, the incorrectly formatted latitude and longitude for the MVA site were not corrected in OCC Helper until after the helicopter had departed its base en route to the MVA site. Given the IMC weather conditions being reported, which were below the required VFR weather minimums for the flight, the OCC coordinators should have provided the pilot with additional weather information after they had correctly input the coordinates of the MVA site into the OCC Helper software; however, they did not do so. The lack of monitoring of the flight by the OCC through direct human interaction due to overreliance on mission support software and other automated aids, and the incorrectly interpreted latitude and longitude information by both the software and the operational control coordinators resulted in a loss of operational control. Although the software formatting issues were known, there was no standard operating procedure to mitigate the problem.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had access to internet-based weather information at the helicopter's base, but it is unknown what weather information the pilot reviewed before beginning the flight to the MVA.  However, text messages between the pilot and a friend and between the flight nurse on the accident flight and the same friend indicated that the pilot was aware of the possibility of encountering IMC before he departed the base for the MVA site. Further, after landing at the MVA, the pilot would have been aware that the weather conditions at the site were below the company's VFR weather minimums. Given the weather conditions at the MVA site, the pilot should have canceled the flight or, at a minimum, contacted the OCC to obtain updated weather information and guidance. However, the pilot's fixation on completing the mission probably motivated him to depart on the accident flight in IMC, even though significantly less risky alternatives existed, such as canceling the flight and transporting the patient by ground ambulance.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 26, 2016, about 0018 central daylight time, a Eurocopter AS350 B2, N911GF, impacted trees and terrain near Enterprise, Alabama. The airline transport pilot, flight nurse, flight paramedic, and patient being transported were fatally injured. The helicopter, which was registered to Haynes Life Flight LLC and operated by Metro Aviation, Inc., was substantially damaged. The flight was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135 as a helicopter air ambulance flight. Night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed for the flight, which operated on a company visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan. The flight departed from a farm field near Goodman, Alabama, about 0017, and was destined for Baptist Medical Center Heliport (AL11), Montgomery, Alabama.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Coffee County Sheriff's Office, on March 25, 2016, about 2309, sheriff's deputies and the Enterprise Rescue Squad were dispatched to a motor vehicle accident (MVA) near Goodman, Alabama. A sheriff's deputy contacted Haynes Ambulance Communication Center (HCC) by cellular phone when he learned that the motor vehicle was overturned and that an unconscious victim was inside.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to communications records, HCC received the call from the deputy at 2319:10. The pilot of the helicopter, was notified at 2320:38. The helicopter, which was known as \"Life Flight 2\" and was based at the Troy Regional Medical Center, Troy, Alabama, departed Troy at 2326:57 and arrived at the landing zone (LZ) in a farm field adjacent to the MVA site at 2353:15.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses stated that, after touchdown, the pilot remained in the helicopter with the engine running. The flight paramedic and flight nurse exited the helicopter and entered the Enterprise Rescue Squad ambulance to help prepare the patient for transport.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnce the patient was ready for transport, the flight nurse, flight paramedic, and several other emergency responders rolled the gurney about 70 yards through a grassy area to the helicopter and loaded the patient on-board. One of the first responders later reported that he noticed that the pilot had something over his eyes \"like sunglasses, but it was square looking.\" Once the patient had been loaded, the flight nurse and flight paramedic also boarded, and, at 0016:45, the helicopter lifted off and turned north toward AL11.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of radar data provided by the United States Army from the approach control radar site at Cairns Army Airfield (OZR), Fort Rucker, Alabama, located about 13 nautical miles east of the accident site, indicated that, the helicopter was first identified on radar after takeoff at 0017:35.  The helicopter was in a shallow left turn and climbing to 1,000 ft above mean sea level. At 0018:04, the rate of turn began to increase and continued to increase over the next 4 seconds when the helicopter reached a peak altitude of 1,100 ft. The helicopter remained at this altitude and continued the left turn until 0018:28 when the helicopter began a rapid descent. Five seconds later, radar indicated that helicopter had descended through 600 ft. Moments later, the helicopter descended below the floor of the radar coverage area, and radar contact was lost. According to the radar data, the flight lasted about 1 minute.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to HCC, the helicopter's on-board Skyconnect satellite tracking system updated every 3 minutes, and the pilot was supposed to contact them every 15 minutes. However, after the helicopter lifted off, HCC did not receive the pilot's normal 15-minute check-in, and, when they checked the satellite tracking system, it showed that it had not updated and that the helicopter was still at the LZ. HCC then began to notify authorities that they believed that the helicopter was down somewhere. About 0700, after an extensive search, search parties began to smell what they believed was jet fuel and eventually located the wreckage in a swampy, heavily wooded area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Metro Aviation, and pilot records, the pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with a helicopter rating and type ratings for the Agusta Westland AB-139 and AW-139. He also held a flight instructor certificate with ratings for helicopter and instrument helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was hired as a flight instructor in June 2009 by Helicopters of America. He then became their lead flight instructor and worked for them until September 2009 when the company ceased operation. He was then hired by Cloud 9 Helicopters, where he became senior flight instructor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn April 14, 2011, he was hired by Petroleum Helicopters International (PHI). When hired by PHI, he had accrued 2,448 total hours of helicopter flight experience and had flown the R22, R44, H269, AS355, MD500, MD600, and A109.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt PHI, he flew the AW139 as both a first officer (co-pilot) and a captain (pilot) in both visual flight rules (VFR) and instrument flight rules (IFR) operations. During his tenure at PHI, he accrued an additional 1,889.63 flight hours supporting oil and gas contracts until he left their employment on November 16, 2015.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the pilot had been employed by Metro Aviation for about 6 months and had accumulated 90 hours of flight experience in the accident helicopter make and model since he was hired. His total flight experience was 5,301 hours of which 5,265 hours were as pilot in command, 474 hours were at night, and 265 hours were in actual instrument conditions. His flight experience during the 90 days before the accident was 47 hours, including 20 hours in the 30 days before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of Metro Aviation/PHI training records indicated that he had received training in human factors and decision-making, night operations, night vision goggles (NVGs), and inadvertent entry into IMC. He did not meet currency requirements for flight in IMC at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was manufactured in 1998. It was equipped with a three-blade main rotor system and a two-blade tail rotor system and was powered by a Turbomeca Arriel 1D1 engine rated at 641 shaft horsepower. The helicopter was equipped with skid-type landing gear, a night vision imaging system (NVIS), which consisted of NVGs and NVG-compatible lighting, a helicopter terrain avoidance warning system (HTAWS), and an autopilot. The helicopter was not certificated for flight in IMC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Metro Aviation, the helicopter was maintained under an FAA-approved aircraft inspection program. The helicopter's most recent inspection was completed on February 12, 2016. At the time of the accident, the helicopter had accrued 8,923.2 total hours of operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVideos, Photographs, and Witness Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitness statements indicated that fog, mist, and reduced visibility existed at the MVA site at the time of the helicopter's arrival. Witness statements, photographs, and videos also indicated that these conditions were still present when the helicopter lifted off about 23 minutes later.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of witness videos and photographs of the accident flight revealed that, during the takeoff sequence, very light to light precipitation was falling in the field surrounding the helicopter. The precipitation was also visible in the helicopter's landing light beams directed forward from the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to one witness, there was slight drizzle around the time of the takeoff, and, although there was no ground fog, there may have been fog above the trees. Another witness stated that there was a heavy mist, and the ceiling was \"very low, maybe 100 foot.\" This witness also stated he could see the tops of the trees, and, by shining his flashlight up, he could easily tell that the fog started about two to three times as high as the nearest tree. Another witness stated that, at the time of the helicopter's departure, the fog was mixed with rain and was \"kind of pretty thick.\" This witness also mentioned that the helicopter flew over the road, which was not far from the LZ, and the witness lost visual contact with the helicopter due to the fog.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSurface Analysis Chart&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) Surface Analysis Chart for 0100 depicted a stationary front that stretched from the northeastern Gulf of Mexico north-northeastward into southeastern Alabama and northeastward into western South Carolina. A low-pressure center was located in eastern Alabama. The station models around the accident site depicted air temperatures in the low to mid 60's degrees Fahrenheit (°F), with temperature-dew point spreads of 1°F or less, a southeast to east wind below 10 knots, cloudy skies, and fog. Areas near frontal boundaries with low temperature-dewpoint spreads at the surface are typically locations conducive to the formation of low clouds and fog, and, if enough moisture is available, precipitation can also be present.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSurface Observations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEnterprise Municipal Airport (EDN), located 4 miles east-northeast of the accident site, was the closest official weather station to the accident site and had an Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS). EDN weather at 0015 was reported as wind from 120° at 4 knots, 3 miles visibility, drizzle, an overcast ceiling at 300 ft above ground level (agl), temperature of 17°C, dew point temperature of 17°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.97 inches of mercury. EDN weather at 0035 was reported as wind from 120° at 4 knots, 3 miles visibility, drizzle, an overcast ceiling at 300 ft agl, temperature of 17°C, dew point temperature of 17°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.97 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nObservations from other stations near the accident site also indicated low instrument flight rules (LIFR) conditions due to ceilings below 500 ft agl at the accident time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSatellite Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVisible and infrared images obtained from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite number 13 indicated abundant cloud cover over the accident site at the time of the accident. The cloud tops near the accident site were moving from southwest to northeast. Based on the brightness temperatures above the accident site and the vertical temperature profile, the cloud-top heights over the accident site were about 16,000 ft at 0115.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRadar Imagery Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest NWS Weather Surveillance Radar-1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) was located 28 nautical miles east-northeast of the accident site at an elevation of 434 ft, at Fort Rucker, Alabama. The WSR-88D base reflectivity images indicated very light precipitation between AL11 and the automobile accident site before 2320 on March 25. The very light to light precipitation continued to form, increase in area coverage, and move over the automobile accident site while the helicopter was en route and while the helicopter was on the ground loading the patient. The accident flight likely took off in drizzle or light rain conditions, and these precipitation conditions persisted through the accident time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirmen's Meteorological Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) Sierra for IFR conditions due to mist was issued at 2145 on March 25 and was valid at the accident time. There was another AIRMET Sierra for IFR conditions due to mist and precipitation that was also valid just east of the accident site for portions of Georgia and northwestern Florida. These AIRMETs were valid at the time flight notification at 2321 on March 25 all the way through the accident flight time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTerminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAFs)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOZR and Dothan Regional Airport (DHN), Dothan, Alabama, located XX miles and XX miles from the accident site, respectively, both had TAFs that forecast IFR or LIFR conditions at the accident time, and both OZR and DHN TAFs were issued well before the time the pilot was notified of the mission.&#x0D;\nNational Weather Service Discussion&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Weather Service Office in Tallahassee, Florida, issued an Area Forecast Discussion (AFD) at 1929 on March 25 for the area surrounding the accident site. The aviation section of the AFD mentioned that IFR conditions would be present at all airports overnight with improving conditions by the daytime on March 26.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAstronomical Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMoonrise occurred at 2103 on March 25. The phase of the moon was waning gibbous with 91% of the moon's visible disk illuminated. .&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor further details concerning meteorological information, refer to the Meteorology Report in the public docket for this accident investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccident Site Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter had struck trees about 1/2 mile north of the motor vehicle accident site. A debris path ran from south to north at a downward angle of about 45° through the trees and led to the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe and Rotor System Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was heavily fragmented with only the aft fuselage being easily recognizable. The fuel tank was broken open, and the smell of jet fuel was present. The engine and transmission were separated from their mounts. The main wreckage was resting at the base of a large tree, and other 80-ft- to 100-ft-tall trees along the debris path exhibited impact damage and evidence of blade strikes. Examination of the  main rotor blades (MRBs) indicated that the main rotor was under power during the accident sequence, and the blue and red MRBs were broken in mutual locations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom displayed a right horizontal bend mid-span; the right horizontal stabilizer and the tail rotor remained attached to the tail boom. Control continuity and rotation were confirmed from the tailrotor to the aft bulkhead. The left horizontal stabilizer was separated from its mounting location. The tail rotor pedals were separated from their mounting locations. Tail rotor pedal control continuity through the tail rotor flex ball cable was confirmed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nContinuity was confirmed through the transmission, and all three main rotor actuators (left roll, right roll, and pitch) and the tail rotor actuator were identified along with their associated hardware. No abnormalities with hydraulic servo integrity were noted, and all push-pull tubes and mixing unit actuators were broken and exhibited signatures consistent with overload signatures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain Rotor Actuators Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left roll actuator remained attached to the stationary star by its rod-end bearing, and the other two main rotor actuators were detached and torn from the stationary star and rod-end bearings. The right roll actuator adaptor casing showed an approximately 2.5-inch break from the threaded attachment fitting to the stationary star. All main rotor actuator servo input rods remained attached to the rotor mast casing and could be moved by hand in and out of each adaptor casing. All three servo input rods showed evidence of bending. All three main rotor accumulators were intact with the right roll and left roll accumulators showing slight dents on their outer surfaces. Pressure from each of the main rotor accumulators was released via its Schrader valve. At least 120 psi of pressure was released from each accumulator, indicating the accumulators were normally charged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTail Rotor Actuator Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor actuator unit was still attached to the airframe, the servo accumulator, and the load compensator. The hydraulic input and return lines exhibited evidence of hydraulic fluid being present. The tail rotor accumulator was intact and released 50 psi of pressure via its Schrader valve, indicating the accumulator was normally charged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAttitude Indicator and Directional Gyro Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe attitude indicator was disassembled and examined. The gyro showed rotational scoring on the inner and outer housings consistent with rotation at the time of impact. The directional gyro was also disassembled and examined. The gyro showed scoring on the inner and outer housings consistent with rotation at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel Filters Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was fitted with a standard engine fuel filter attached to the fuel control unit and an aftermarket airframe fuel filtering system. Both fuel filter housing units were clean and free of debris. Both filters also appeared to be clean and unobstructed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine displayed external impact damage. The free turbine blades remained intact. The fuel control unit (FCU) was separated from the accessory gearbox; both FCU shafts were present and intact; the FCU remained attached by the fuel and air lines. The P2 line was still attached to both the intermediate case and the FCU.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe axial compressor had foreign object damage on all 13 blades and curling opposite the direction of rotation was observed on several blades. Both the Module 1 and the Module 5 magnetic plugs were clean. Both electric chip detectors (main and TU208 rear bearing) were clean. Module 5 was removed, and the input pinion slippage mark was found displaced in the over-torqued direction about 2 to 2.5 millimeters, a measurement consistent with engine power being produced at the time of main rotor strike.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe freewheel shaft was checked, and proper operation confirmed. Continuity to the N2 drive of the FCU was confirmed. The gas generator could not be turned by hand, and the free turbine could not be turned by hand.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe oil, air, and fuel lines were found connected to engine and properly secured. The electrical connection cannon plugs were still connected to the engine deck; the harnesses had been broken during the impact sequence. The rear engine mount was still connected to the linking tube, but both rubber mounts were separated from the engine deck. The front support was broken at the connection to the aircraft liaison tube.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe transmission shaft was found inside the liaison tube but neither side flector groups, nor bolts were connected to it. The flector group on the engine side was still connected to the flanged adapter, and on the freewheel shaft. The 3 bolts from the main gearbox input, to the transmission shaft had been broken, and the holes were found elongated opposite the direction of rotation consistent with power being produced at the time of main rotor strike.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, Montgomery, Alabama, performed postmortem examinations on all three crew members and the patient. The cause of death for all four occupants was listed as multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological testing of the pilot. The specimens from the pilot were negative for all tested drugs. Testing for ethanol, carbon monoxide and cyanide was not performed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMetro Aviation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMetro Aviation was incorporated in 1982 as a helicopter charter, flight training, and maintenance operation. They entered the air medical service business in November 1983. At the time of the accident, Metro Aviation operated more than 130 aircraft out of 98 bases for more than 30 programs in 18 states across the country. Metro Aviation's operations division provided pilots and maintenance technicians for the aircraft in their various programs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHaynes Ambulance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHaynes Ambulance was started in 1969 in Wetumpka, Alabama. In 1977, Haynes Ambulance of Alabama, Inc., was established in Montgomery Alabama. Haynes Life Flight LLC began operations in June 2014. At the time of the accident, Haynes Ambulance/Life Flight's operations covered three counties in Central Alabama (Elmore, Montgomery, and Pike) as well as Maxwell Air Force Base. Additionally, they had a variety of mutual aid agreements with various surrounding cities, counties, municipal, and private agencies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHaynes Ambulance/Life Flight covered an area of about 1,420 square miles from 9 strategically located stations throughout their service area. About 180 full-time and part-time emergency medical technicians (EMT) and paramedics cared for emergency and convalescent patients, serving a population of over 500,000 citizens with over 35 ground ambulances and 2 helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAeronautical Decision-making&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA Advisory Circular AC 60-22, Aeronautical Decision Making, \"pilots, particularly those with considerable experience, as a rule always try to complete a flight as planned, please passengers, meet schedules, and generally demonstrate that they have 'the right stuff'.\" One of the common behavioral traps identified was \"Get-There-Itis.\" According to the AC, \"common among pilots, [get-there-itis] clouds the vision and impairs judgment by causing a fixation on the original goal or destination combined with a total disregard for any alternative course of action.\" Get-There-Itis is also known as hurry syndrome, plan continuation, or goal fixation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMetro Aviation Operations Manual&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Metro Aviation's Operations Manual, the pilot-in-command of an aircraft had the final authority and responsibility for decisions relating to safety of flight and was required to select the most conservative course of action if a conflict arose concerning a Metro Aviation policy, procedure, or regulation. Operational control coordinators and operational control supervisors were responsible for confirming whether a flight or series of flights could be initiated, conducted, or terminated safely, in accordance with the authorizations, limitations, and procedures in the Metro Aviation Operations Manual and the applicable regulations. They were also \"authorized to terminate a flight for any reason that may be contrary to [Federal aviation regulations] FARs or policy.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather minimums were also published in the operations manual for all VFR operations. Review of the weather minimums indicated that:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- When flying at night using an approved NVIS or HTAWS in non-mountainous, local flying areas, an 800-ft ceiling with a flight visibility of 3 statute miles was required.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- When flying at night using an approved NVIS or HTAWS in non-mountainous, non-local, flying areas, a 1,000-ft ceiling with a flight visibility of 3 statute miles was required.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGuidance for use of NVIS stated, \"at no time shall NVGs be utilized to continue flight into weather below the minimums.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGuidance for inadvertent IMC or loss of visual surface reference stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"Inadvertent IMC does not only mean situations where an aircraft enters clouds, but also entering areas of reduced visibility, darkness with no ground lighting, and/or lowering ceiling resulting in the loss of visual ground reference. Pilots are expected to avoid inadvertent IMC and the loss of visual surface reference by maintaining situational awareness of weather changes and environmental conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilots should be prepared for the possibility of inadvertent IMC or loss of visual surface reference. All company aircraft will carry current instrument approach charts and low altitude enroute maps for the area where the aircraft is assigned or expected to be flown. These charts and maps are to be used in the event that the aircraft enters into \"inadvertent IMC\" or \"loss of visual reference\". …&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA minimum safe altitude [MSA] chart for each base local area will be carried on each base aircraft for quick reference by the pilot. ….&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMinimum safe altitudes outside the local area will be 1000 feet above the maximum elevation figure as depicted on the VFR Sectional Chart for the aircraft location or the minimum off route obstruction clearance altitude as depicted on IFR Low En route chart. Inadvertent IMC is an emergency situation which requires maximum pilot attention. Good crew resource management is essential to safely deal with the emergency and make a successful recovery. Pilots will brief their medical crew members on their roles and responsibilities in the event of an inadvertent IMC prior to flight in marginal VFR conditions or en route if marginal VFR conditions are encountered.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Operations Manual further advised that:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"In case of inadvertent IMC or Loss of visual surface reference the following procedure will be followed:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA. Maintain positive control of the aircraft with reference to instruments&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1) Attitude – Level&#x0D;\n2) Heading – Turn only to avoid known obstacles&#x0D;\n3) Power – Adjust to climb power&#x0D;\n4) Airspeed – Adjust to climb airspeed&#x0D;\n5) Make turns no greater than standard rate&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nB. Climb to the minimum safe altitude (MSA) to clear all obstacles in the area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nC. Communicate&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1) Declare an emergency to ATC&#x0D;\na. Squawk 7700&#x0D;\nb. Report:&#x0D;\ni. last known position,&#x0D;\nii. heading, altitude,&#x0D;\niii. fuel remaining, and&#x0D;\niv. souls on board&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n2) State nature of emergency (inadvertent IMC), intentions, and request for assistance&#x0D;\na. Weather: Determine if VFR conditions can be reached with ATC assistance.&#x0D;\nb. Obstacles: Remain at or above a minimum safe altitude.&#x0D;\nc. ATC can provide frequencies, vectors, courses, and altitude for airways and approaches.&#x0D;\nd. If no assistance is available in the aircraft, use ATC for as much help as you need.&#x0D;\ne. Complete the approach procedure to a landing or entering VMC conditions.&#x0D;\nf. Maintain VMC and land.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMetro Aviation's Operational Control Center&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Metro Aviation's Operations Manual, operational control is a two-tier system. The first tier involves the placement of an airworthy aircraft listed in the company's operations specifications and a current and qualified crew.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe second tier is determining whether a flight or series of flights can be initiated, conducted, or terminated safely and in accordance with all policies, procedures, general operations manual and regulations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTo accomplish operational control, Metro Aviation's Operational Control Center (OCC) was staffed 24 hours a day by operational control coordinators. The OCC continually monitored flight operations, weather trends, aircraft status, and any change that could affect the ability of the pilot to initiate, conduct, or terminate a flight or series of flights in accordance with the Metro Aviation Operations Manual, Operations Specifications, or Metro Operations Memos.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the OCC used two software systems to comply with Operations Specification A008-Operational Control (14 CFR 135.77- Responsibility for Operational Control and 14 CFR 135.79 Flight Locating Requirements). The first software system was the Metro Aviation Secure Website (MASW), acted as a central collection and processing point for operational information. Users logged into the system with a unique username and password and interacted within the system in accordance with the permissions granted by the company administrator. The MASW was routinely relied upon by Metro Aviation pilots, operational control coordinators, mechanics, aircraft records employees, pilot records employees, and partner communication centers/communication specialists.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe second software system was the OCC Helper (OH), which was developed by Metro Aviation to perform key compliance tasks and to monitor company flight operations. The primary logic of this application was focused on routine queries of company databases (pilot records, aircraft status reports, etc.), as well as outside resources such as NWS reports and forecasts. Operational control center coordinators were the only Metro Aviation employees trained and allowed access to OH.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDetermination of pilot qualifications and aircraft status at the various bases was accomplished by the OCC using Operational Control Form 1 (OCF-1).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMetro Aviation required that, before commencing any flight operation, and after a pilot had logged-in for his/her assigned duty period and completed the pre-flight inspection of the aircraft assigned, the pilot was to complete the OCF-1 electronically using the MASW. Upon receiving the OCF-1 at the OCC, the OH software would query the Metro Aviation Pilot Records Database and display a summary view of the pilot's aircraft qualifications, currency, and medical certificate status. Additionally, the OH software would query the Metro Aviation Aircraft Records Database and provide a summary view of the aircraft's maintenance status. After reviewing these records and determining that they were appropriate, the operational control coordinator would electronically attest that the OCF-1 had been reviewed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe OCF-1 was an editable form that pilots would routinely update throughout their assigned duty periods to report changes in weather, static risk, or aircraft maintenance status. Once the pilot completed an edit, the OCC would be prompted to perform an updated review of the form.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight locating requirements were addressed by the OCC using Operational Control Form 2 (OCF-2). The OCF-2 was the primary oversight for a specific Part 135 flight or series of flights. To achieve this oversight, Metro Aviation partnered with multiple communication centers throughout the country. Each communication center was associated with a specific Metro Aviation client's program. Some programs were just one base and one aircraft; others were several bases and several aircraft all associated with the same Metro Aviation client.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCommunication center employees were not Metro Aviation employees; however, all the communication center employees were trained by Metro Aviation. This training was recognized in the approved Metro Aviation Training Manual and was conducted both initially and then annually for currency requirements.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe communications center's primary role in Metro Aviation flight operations was communicating flight requests to the Metro Aviation pilots and the Metro Aviation OCC. In the example of a car accident response, the first responder on scene (ambulance, fire dept., etc.) would make the initial request for the aircraft to the communication center, who would then notify the Metro Aviation pilot. The Metro Aviation pilot would then analyze the request in accordance with the Metro Aviation Operations Manual, Metro Aviation Training Program, Operations Specifications, and Federal Aviation Regulations and either accept or decline the flight. Whether accepted or declined by the pilot, the communication center would submit the OCF-2 to the OCC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe OCF-2 was an electronic form accessed through the MASW. Once a communication center submitted the OCF-2 for a flight and the pilot accepted, an \"OCC Number\" would be issued to the communications center electronically as confirmation that the OCF-2 was received. The OCC's processing of the OCF-2 information was accomplished using the OH software. The OH software would query the OCF-2 for multiple data points including:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- Aircraft registration&#x0D;\n- Metro Base Name and Metro Aviation Client Program Name&#x0D;\n- Pilot name&#x0D;\n- Date the OCF-2 was submitted by the communication center&#x0D;\n- Time the flight is initiated&#x0D;\n- Route of flight&#x0D;\n- Estimated time enroute (ETE)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWith this information, the software would once again access pilot training records and aircraft records to verify the pilot's qualifications, currency, medical certificate status, and the aircraft's airworthiness status. ETE information was analyzed by OH in relation to the pilot's reported start time of the assigned duty period to ensure the planned termination of the flight would not exceed the maximum allowed 14 hours of duty time. The estimated termination time of a flight was also monitored, and an alert would be displayed within the OCC if the flight had not ended within that time (aircraft overdue response).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe final data point analyzed by OH was the route of flight. The OH application recognized all FAA airport/heliport identifiers, Metro base identifiers, hospital identifiers, and 30 formats of GPS coordinates. Using this information, OH would query the NWS internet sites to obtain reported and forecast weather conditions along the route of flight indicated on the OCF-2. OH would display this information in a textual release summary. The operational control coordinator was responsible for reviewing the release summary. If the weather conditions were found to be out of compliance with the Operations Manual and Operations Specification requirements, the operational control coordinator would contact the pilot directly or by relay through the appropriate communication center.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnce a flight became airborne, the OCC would monitor the progress of the flight through a central display known as the Outerlink Console. This display would translate the various manufacturers' satellite tracking transponders and depict the aircraft's movement over a satellite view of the terrain. The Outerlink Console did not display weather information.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe OCF-2 was an editable form and was routinely accessed by either a communication center or the Metro Aviation OCC to update the route of flight, ETE, or to close the OCF-2 with \"Time Terminated\" information.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOccurrences in the OCC During and Around the Time of the Accident Flight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were two Metro Aviation personnel on duty before and during the time of the accident at the OCC, a trainee operational control coordinator and a senior operational control coordinator. The trainee coordinator stated that when the accident flight request came into the OCC, the weather was reviewed using information from FAA-approved resources and through their Schneider Electric weather source.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe trainee coordinator stated that, on the night of the accident, he and the senior coordinator were using OH, which he referred to as the \"old system\" that he was not that familiar with. The trainee coordinator mentioned OH could crash while one was looking at it and flights could be airborne 15 minutes before a person was aware of it. In addition, the trainee coordinator mentioned that the coordinates for the location of the motor vehicle accident were correct, but that the format was not correct in OH. The trainee coordinator stated that the latitude and longitude format was a common problem with OH and that Metro Aviation OCC personnel had to reformat the latitude and longitude coordinates at times to get the coordinates to work in OH. The trainee coordinator mentioned that HCC would not have known of any formatting issues with Metro's OH software.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe trainee coordinator stated that he and the senior coordinator checked the weather the night of the accident, but nothing drew their attention to the weather.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBefore the accident, it was common practice for communication centers, such as HCC, to fill out only the first segment or first few segments of the total flight route on the OCF-2 forms when sending that information into the OCC for review. When all the segments of flight were known, it was common practice to go back and complete or adjust the OCF-2 form in the official OCC Release Summary. This adjustment of the flight route occurred for the accident flight with the initial flight notification on the OCF-2 form from the HCC being at 2321 on March 25 and a current flight tracking record change done by the HCC at 2359 on March 25.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the flight release revealed that the requested route of flight was Troy, Alabama, to the incorrectly-formatted latitude and longitude coordinates; it did not include the flight from the MVA site to the hospital. Since OH did not recognize the coordinates, the only weather information provided was for Troy Municipal Airport (TOI), about 5 miles from the helicopter's base. The TOI METAR about 42 minutes before the flight departed reported 10 miles visibility and a cloud ceiling of 6,500 ft. Although the TOI Terminal Aerodrome Forecast indicated that conditions would be deteriorating, the flight was predicted to return to base before that occurred. The route of flight was updated during the time the helicopter was on the ground at the MVA and would have provided further information about the conditions along the route, the OCC made no attempt to provide the updated weather information to the pilot. The trainee reviewed the release summary for the accident flight; the senior operational control coordinator provided no oversight of the review.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the accident, HCC noted that the format for the coordinates provided to Metro Aviation OCC for the accident flight was the same format that the HCC had been providing to the Metro Aviation OCC for the previous 2 years. Metro Aviation OCC did not have a procedure to ensure correct formatting of these coordinates.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot Weather Briefing&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's assessment of weather conditions at the start of his/her assigned duty period was communicated on the OCF-1 in a generalized color code. Green indicated no significant weather concerns; yellow indicated that commencing a flight may not be possible; and red indicated weather conditions prohibited flight operations. Metro Aviation provided internet-based, NWS-approved weather information to each of its bases of operation. This information would have been readily available to the accident pilot at the time of the flight request.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident pilot did not receive an official weather briefing from Lockheed Martin Flight Service (LMFS) or from Direct User Access Terminal Service (DUATS) and was not required to do so. The pilot did check the weather before the flight to the automobile accident scene, but it is unknown what weather information the pilot reviewed. The pilot completed an OCF-1 at the start of his shift around 1928 on March 25. At that time, the pilot assessed the weather conditions as \"yellow.\" If the pilot had reviewed weather conditions after the 2321 notification time, the surface observations, TAFs, and AIRMET Sierra would have all indicated LIFR to IFR conditions near the MVA. There was no record of the accident pilot receiving or retrieving any additional weather information before the accident flight, or before and during the flight to the MVA.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot and Flight Nurse Text Message Summaries&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a nurse who was a friend of both the pilot and the flight nurse, they would text with each other routinely. Review of their text messages on the night of the accident indicated that the pilot was aware of the weather conditions before the flights. The following are excerpts from the text messages obtained from the nurse by the NTSB:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nText messages between the flight nurse and the friend:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 2328, the flight nurse advised her friend, \"Got a flight.\" Her friend responded, \"Have fun at that [motor vehicle accident] MVA.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 2336, the flight nurse advised her friend, \"Lots of fog!!!\" Her friend then responded, \"You're in good hands.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 2337, the flight nurse responded to her friend and stated, \"I know. But even he is like…Umm its pretty thick. Hahahaha.\" She then added, \"He said we are good. 5 mins out.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 2340, the friend stated, \"Sweet. Keep me posted.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 2343, the flight nurse advised that they were, \"1.8 miles out.\" (This was the last text message sent by the flight nurse before the accident occurred.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nText messages between the pilot and the friend:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 2354, the pilot advised the friend, \"Shhhh this was more than work…Actually had to pull out some piloting skills.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 2356, the friend messaged the pilot stating, \"That's what you got those mad piloting skills for my dear…to use them lol…was it bad?\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 2358, the pilot responded back to the friend advising that he would have to let the flight nurse tell her \"but put it this way the other guys would have turned around.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 0000, the friend advised him, \"She text me that there was lots of fog but that's all she said. I just responded to her she was in good hands…\" The friend then asked, \"Where did y'all go.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 0001, the pilot answered stating, \"We are in enterprise..I'm sittin here still spinning watin..Gonna have to take to south it's the only place where weather is flyable.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 0002, the friend asked him, \"How long will it take you to get to south?\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 0003, the pilot advised her, \"Maybe 25-30 min.\" The friend then asked, \"Is it gonna be one of those flights where you have to use those mad piloting skills again?&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 0004, the pilot responded stating, \"Yea to take off after that should be good.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 0005, the friend asked the pilot, \"They still getting the patient loaded.\" He then responded, \"Yea they still in the ambulance.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 0006, the friend stated, \"At least they have the best pilot taking them there.\" The pilot responded that, \"I wouldn't say all that…\" (This was the last text message sent by the pilot before the accident occurred).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGet-There-Itis&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA Advisory Circular AC 60-22, Aeronautical Decision Making, \"pilots, particularly those with considerable experience, as a rule always try to complete a flight as planned, please passengers, meet schedules, and generally demonstrate that they have 'the right stuff.'.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne of the common behavioral traps identified was \"Get-There-Itis.\" According to the AC, \"common among pilots, [get-there-itis] clouds the vision and impairs judgment by causing a fixation on the original goal or destination combined with a total disregard for any alternative course of action.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGet-There-Itis is also known as hurry syndrome, plan continuation, or goal fixation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSpatial Disorientation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25B) contained guidance which stated that \"under normal flight conditions, when there is a visual reference to the horizon and ground, the sensory system in the inner ear helps to identify the pitch, roll, and yaw movements of the airplane. When visual contact with the horizon is lost, the vestibular system becomes unreliable. Without visual references outside the airplane, there are many situations where combinations of normal motions and forces can create convincing illusions that are difficult to overcome.\" The Handbook also advised, \"unless a pilot has many hours of training in instrument flight, flight in reduced visibility or at night when the horizon is not visible should be avoided.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3), \"night flying is very different from day flying and demands more attention of the pilot. The most noticeable difference is the limited availability of outside visual references. Therefore, flight instruments should be used to a greater degree.… Generally, at night it is difficult to see clouds and restrictions to visibility, particularly on dark nights or under overcast. The pilot flying under VFR must exercise caution to avoid flying into clouds or a layer of fog.\" The handbook described some hazards associated with flying in airplanes under VFR when visual references, such as the ground or horizon, are obscured stating that \"the vestibular sense (motion sensing by the inner ear) in particular tends to confuse the pilot. Because of inertia, the sensory areas of the inner ear cannot detect slight changes in the attitude of the airplane, nor can they accurately sense attitude changes that occur at a uniform rate over a period of time. On the other hand, false sensations are often generated; leading the pilot to believe the attitude of the airplane has changed when in fact, it has not. These false sensations result in the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation.\" -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot of the helicopter was performing a local air tour around the island with four passengers onboard. During the flight, he noticed a vibration throughout the cabin. The pilot diverted toward the destination airport; however, when the vibration stopped shortly thereafter, he decided to initiate a turn so the passengers could see a nearby landmark. The vibration returned shortly thereafter, and the pilot began to maneuver toward the destination airport a second time. The pilot stated that the vibration developed into a grinding sensation, which was followed by illumination of the main rotor low rpm warning light and an increase in engine rpm to the point where the engine and rotor RPM needles were no longer matched on the power turbine gauge.  The pilot initiated an approach to a grassy area near the shoreline; however, due to the presence of people nearby, he turned the helicopter slightly left to land in the water as close to shore as possible. The pilot said that, about 20 ft above the water, it felt like the main rotor stalled, the helicopter lost lift, and it \"fell out of the sky.\" The helicopter descended rapidly into the water and sank about 20 ft from the shoreline.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree of the passengers were able to egress the helicopter following impact; however, the middle aft seat passenger was trapped inside. A first responder stated that he and another person repeatedly dove underwater to cut the passenger's seatbelt straps and extract him. The first responder reported that the passenger's life preserver appeared to be entangled with the seatbelts. Postaccident examination of the life preserver revealed signatures of inflation and cut waist straps, with no other damage noted. It could not be determined when or how the life preserver was inflated; the first responder could not recall whether it was inflated and the nurse providing CPR said it was not inflated. Review of treatment records for the passenger revealed evidence consistent with drowning, and no traumatic injuries to the head or neck. It could not be determined whether the passenger was unable to extricate himself from the restraint, or if he had a period of unconsciousness resulting from the impact that contributed to his drowning. The helicopter's doors were not installed at the time of the accident and all five seat restraints were found to be in working order and undamaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter revealed that the engine-to-transmission drive shaft was separated at the transmission side. Metallurgical examination of the engine-to-transmission drive shaft components revealed that the forward coupling did not appear to be lubricated and that there were multiple indications of exposure to elevated temperature, such as heat tinting and loss of the temperature plates on the forward outer coupling, high-temperature cadmium-induced brittle fracture of two forward attachment bolt heads, and a loss of hardness of the bolt head material due to high-temperature tempering. The external spline teeth on the forward spherical coupling were worn down to the bottom landings, while comparatively minor wear marks were observed on the mating internal spline teeth of the forward outer coupling. The asymmetry in the wear pattern between the spherical coupling and the outer coupling combined with the observations consistent with elevated temperatures indicate that the assembly likely failed by overheating due to lack of lubrication. This resulted in softening and subsequent failure of the spring that limits and centers the spherical coupling. When the spring failed, the coupling shifted forward, damaging the forward end of the outer coupling, fracturing the forward cover plate, and wearing the external spline teeth down to the bottom landings. Following the failure of the drive shaft, the engine would have continued to operate, but would not have been able to drive the main rotor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInterviews with the pilot, the owner of the company, and a non-mechanic rated maintenance assistant indicated that maintenance had recently been conducted on the engine-to-transmission drive shaft, even though this was not recorded in the helicopter's maintenance records. In addition, the owner, who was a rated mechanic, was not present the entire time throughout the removal, inspection, and subsequent reinstallation of the engine-to-transmission drive shaft.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt is likely that, when this maintenance was conducted, grease was not applied to the forward coupling as specified in the manufacturer's maintenance manual. Further review of maintenance records revealed no entries pertaining to a current annual inspection or 100-hour inspection. Additionally, a component inspection sheet provided by the operator revealed that several required component inspections were overdue and had not been completed at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the FAA was conducting oversight in accordance with their guidance, increased inspections may have uncovered the inadequate maintenance and documentation, which in turn, may have prevented the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 18, 2016, about 1020 Hawaii-Aleutian standard time, a Bell 206BIII, N80918, was substantially damaged when it impacted water during a forced landing near Honolulu, Hawaii. The commercial pilot and two passengers sustained serious injuries, one passenger sustained minor injuries, and one passenger was fatally injured. The helicopter was privately owned and operated by Genesis Helicopters as a commercial air tour flight under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a company flight plan was filed for the local flight, which originated from Honolulu International Airport (HNL) about 0935.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that, after arriving at work the day of the accident, the helicopter was pulled out of the hangar and that he began his preflight with the company's mechanic's assistant. The pilot stated that they completed \"a pretty good preflight,\" because the flight was the first tour flight since replacement of the tail rotor drive shaft. The pilot further stated that he confirmed fuel quantity and checked other fluids before he retrieved and inspected the life preservers. The pilot then went upstairs to the company's office, met the passengers, showed them the safety video, and stored their belongings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter he boarded the passengers, whose seat positions were determined by weight and balance calculations, he put the passenger's life preservers on them and secured their seatbelts, the pilot conducted a final walkaround of the helicopter before boarding and starting the engine.  After departure, the flight proceeded to fly the Shoreline 6 departure procedure to crossover to the east side of Oahu Island. The pilot then flew along the shoreline before flying toward Sacred Valley, then North Shore before turning south to fly down Central Valley, over Wheeler Army Airfield, and on to Pearl Harbor.  The pilot said that, as he began the approach to Ford Island, he noticed a vibration throughout the cabin of the helicopter that seemed \"different.\"  He decided to return directly to HNL; however, the vibration stopped, and he made a left turn so the passengers could see the USS Arizona Memorial.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nShortly thereafter, the vibration returned, and the pilot called the air traffic control tower at HNL to advise that the flight would be returning to the airport. The controller instructed the pilot to fly to the prison and hold for other inbound helicopters. The pilot stated that, at this point, the vibration developed into a grinding sensation. Then the main rotor low rpm warning light illuminated, and engine rpm began to rise; the point where the engine and rotor RPM needles were no longer matched on the power turbine gauge. The pilot then lowered the collective, reduced the throttle and realized the engine and main rotor were no longer connected as he began to look for a place to land; he selected the grassy area at the Pearl Harbor Memorial visitor's center. Due to his altitude, he said he tried to increase his sink rate to make the selected landing area and put the helicopter \"back in trim to land\" before he noticed people disembarking from the USS Arizona Memorial ferry vessel in his selected landing area. To avoid the people, the pilot turned the helicopter slightly left to land in the water as close to shore as possible, with hopes that people would come out to help. He stated that when the helicopter was about 20 ft above the water, it felt like the rotor stalled, the helicopter lost lift, and it \"fell out of the sky.\" The helicopter descended rapidly into the water about 20 ft from the shoreline.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses located at various locations at the World War II (WWII) Valor in the Pacific National Monument reported seeing the helicopter at a low altitude before it suddenly descended into the water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of video captured by a witness revealed that the helicopter was approaching the Contemplation Circle area of the World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument. The helicopter's forward airspeed appeared to decrease, the nose pitched up, and the helicopter began to rotate to the left in a slightly nose-up attitude then descended rapidly into the water. At the time of impact, the helicopter appeared to be in a slightly nose-high, left bank attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter ratings. In addition, the pilot held a flight instructor certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. The pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration second-class medical certificate issued on November 6, 2015, with no limitations. The pilot reported that he was unable to locate his logbook after he was released from the hospital; he estimated that at the time of the accident, he had accumulated about 900 total hours of flight experience, with 151 hours in the accident helicopter make/model and 125 hours within the previous 90 days.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter was a Bell Helicopter model 206, serial number 2687. The helicopter was powered by a Rolls-Royce Allison model 250-C20B turboshaft engine, serial number CAE-832146, with maximum takeoff and maximum continuous power ratings of 420 shaft horsepower.  The helicopter was not equipped with an emergency float system.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Helicopter Seating Diagram&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with 5 seats, two in the front, and 3 in the aft section of the cabin.  The helicopter is flown from the front right seat, with passenger seating in the remaining seats as referenced in figure 1.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Bell Helicopter Textron (BHT) representative, an integral part of the helicopter's power train system is the engine-to-transmission drive shaft, located between the transmission and freewheeling drive. The drive shaft (as installed) is comprised of two identical couplings, which are located on either end of the shaft. The internal components consist of two flanges positioned on the ends of the tubular, hollow drive shaft. The assembly requires a retainer ring and packing seal to be positioned against the flange. A drive shaft coupling seal is situated against the packing seal, impeding grease from egressing the coupling assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Figure 2: Engine-to-transmission-driveshaft diagram.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe drive shaft contains a gear sprocket affixed to the shaft flange via 4 bolts (bolt heads positioned on the inside of the coupling). The donut-shaped gear has a hollow area in the middle that aligns with the hollow tube situated between the couplings; a slight lip surrounds the hollow area. The outer coupling gear surrounds the drive gear where it is splined, and torque is transmitted. Inside the coupling, the assembly is equipped with a shaft centering spring. The spring (item 6 in figure 2) is positioned between the lip and the end cap of the coupling (grease retainer plate). A retainer ring and packing seal rest against the back plate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe BHT maintenance manual recommends that, before reassembly, the engine-to-transmission drive shaft couplings be hand-packed with lubricant (C-015 grease) over the top of the internal spline teeth to a depth of 0.2-0.3 inch.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMaintenance Records&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of maintenance records provided by the operator revealed the following recent inspections. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTable: Recent Helicopter Inspections &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo entries referencing a current annual inspection, current 100-hour inspection, or the recent maintenance on the engine-to-transmission drive shaft were located within the airframe and engine logbooks. The most recent maintenance entry was the replacement of a tail rotor drive shaft segment on February 17, 2016, at an airframe total time of 15,516.5 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMaintenance Interviews&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOwner of Genesis Helicopters&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner of the company held a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft rating and a mechanic certificate with airframe and powerplant ratings. He reported that the accident pilot was present during maintenance of the engine-to-transmission drive shaft to observe and pass tools to the mechanics assistant. The owner stated that he witnessed the initial buildup of the shaft, then left the hangar for about an hour to an hour and a half. When he returned, the mechanics assistant had already begun installing the shaft into the helicopter. The owner recalled asking specific questions about the bolts going into the shaft, to include if there was friction on the nuts, to which the assistant responded that there was.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner recalled that the helicopter was grounded on January 23 because the rubber seal (which is located at the base of the short shaft) had come apart, and remnants were found on the (engine) deck. Replacement parts were ordered on January 25, and the helicopter was flying again on January 28. The owner estimated that the helicopter had flown 31 hours from the time the seals on the short shaft were replaced to the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the owner was questioned about the timeframe of the maintenance performed on the short shaft and presented with the helicopter logbooks, he responded that he \"can't find them in the logs\" and that it \"must not have gotten put in the logbooks.\" When asked what manual was utilized to conduct the maintenance on the short shaft seal, the owner stated that they used the maintenance manual from Bell Helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen asked how often maintenance looked at the helicopter, the owner stated that there was a daily inspection and he was personally \"laying eyes on it every night.\" After the last flight of the day, the helicopter would be parked outside and looked at before being placed in the hangar for the night. He said the inspection would included checking the security and mounting, checking all the fluids, and visually inspecting the rotor head, lights and seatbelts. He would also examine the grips, bolts, doublers, and the tail rotor and gearbox security and mounting. When asked if he ever looked in the area of the engine-to-transmission drive shaft, he stated that he was supposed to, but when asked if he recalled doing it, he paused before stating, \"I think the last time that I laid eyes on the short shaft, trying to think back, probably 3 or 4 days before the accident. There was a span prior to [February] 18th that we hadn't been flying. We were waiting on parts for the tail rotor.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner further reported that inspections and airworthiness directives (ADs) were not reviewed on a daily basis. The 100-hour inspection information would have been written in the manual, but there would not have been anything like a countdown to an inspection. He stated that a status sheet for inspections or AD compliance was not kept in the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen asked how pilots ensured compliance with maintenance requirements, he said they had to rely on maintenance personnel to tell them that something was due or close to being due. He said sometimes the pilots would take initiative and see in the front of the book that a 100-hour inspection had been completed. He said that if the pilot saw something unsafe or observed a maintenance issue, then they could cancel the trip on their own without his approval. He said that people who wanted to come work for him knew that he would never push them to fly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner provided a component status sheet on February 21, 2016. There were several items that indicated negative time remaining before an inspection was due. Several of these items were annotated with check marks; the owner indicated that these inspections had been completed, but the sheet had not yet been updated. When asked about the negative-time items that were not checked, he replied that the engine installed in the helicopter at the time of the accident was a loaner engine and that the compressor and turbine listed on the component sheet were not even in the aircraft. Those components \"had gone to the shop to get all that stuff up to date.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen asked about the inspections of the main rotor mast assembly and the tension torsion (TT) straps, which were overdue according to the status sheet, the owner replied that the tail rotor blade had been inspected and the TT straps had not been inspected. He said the overhaul was coming up and that they were in the process of ordering parts. His intention was to take the helicopter out of service for maintenance, which would have included the TT straps. When asked if he knew they were due at the time of the accident, he stated that he knew they were coming due, but did not know that the helicopter had flown that extensively, and did not know they were due until he printed the status sheet for the investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring an in-person interview with the pilot, he was asked to describe the last few maintenance issues experienced with the helicopter. The pilot recalled a vibration with the tail rotor drive shaft, which had been fixed. In addition, he recalled the helicopter going through either a 50-hour or 100-hour inspection around January 15, 2016, at which time all the panels were removed, the insides were scrubbed, and all bearings were re-greased. He said everything that had a grease nozzle or tip received grease. He recalled one of the hanger bearings on the tail rotor drive shaft had loosened, which was found on the 100-hour inspection. When asked about the engine-to-transmission shaft, he recalled the short shaft seal failing and its subsequent replacement, but he could not recall the date of the replacement. He said the rubber boot from the short shaft had unseated and grease had slung around inside the panel. He recalled that the owner called him on a Saturday to inform him that flying for Monday had been cancelled so the boot could be replaced.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that he was present when the work was being done on the short shaft seal and that the owner of the company was teaching the maintenance assistant how to press the seals. While the work was being done, the owner was quizzing the maintenance assistant. He remembered the owner and assistant referring to the maintenance manuals. Toward the end of January, he watched the owner grease the engine-to-transmission drive shaft and saw the splines on the gear when the work was being accomplished.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMechanic's Assistant&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanics assistant, who had been employed with Genesis Helicopters for 8-9 years, did not hold a Mechanics Certificate with airframe or powerplant ratings.  He reported that the \"short shaft\" had been removed due to leaking grease on January 25. Once they had received the new parts and the short shaft was removed, stripped down, and cleaned, the owner of the company inspected everything before reassembly. The assistant stated that, during the reassembly, one half of the engine-to-transmission drive shaft was put back together, followed by the other half. Once the work was completed, they conducted an engine run-up, a leak check, and a test flight before returning the helicopter to service. The assistant recalled that, during the installation of the short shaft, the accident pilot was present. Although the owner of the company was not present the entire time, he was checking the process and quizzed him on the parts and the type of grease used, and he was present to verify that the proper amount of grease was used before installing the shaft. The assistant further reported that he had re-used the same nuts, bolts, and washers to reassemble and reinstalled the short shaft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of recorded data from the HNL automated weather observation station, located about 3 miles southeast of the accident site, revealed the conditions at 0953 included wind from 050° at 12 knots with gusts to 18 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, few clouds at 3,200 ft, scattered clouds at 4,100 ft, temperature 26°C, dew point 13°C, and an altimeter setting of 30.13 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter was submerged about 40 ft under water about 20 ft from the shoreline. The helicopter was removed from the water the day following the accident and was subsequently rinsed with fresh water. The wreckage was moved to a secure location for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the recovered wreckage revealed that the main rotor blades, mast, transmission, engine, tailboom, tail rotor gearbox, and tail rotor blades remained attached to their respective mounts. The aft portion of the fuselage under the aft baggage compartment and behind the aft skid cross tube was compressed upward. The windshield and both lower bubble windows were impact damaged and mostly separated. The forward right doorpost was fractured at the upper area of its mount and partially fractured at the lower mount. None of the doors were installed on the helicopter at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor hub and blades exhibited damage from water impact. Both blades were bent away from the tail near the tail rotor hub. Tail rotor drive continuity was established from the tail rotor forward through a torsional fracture in the #3 tail rotor drive segment to the oil cooler blower shaft, the forward short shaft, and the freewheeling shaft. The tail rotor anti-torque pedals on the pilot's side exhibited a fracture of the control tube and the linkages could not be moved. Moving the pitch of the tail rotor blades demonstrated continuity forward via the pitch change control tube to the fractured control tube at the pedals. The tail rotor gearbox was turned by hand with no binding or unusual sounds. The tail rotor gearbox was shifted aft due to impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nContinuity was observed from the mast through the transmission when the main rotor blades were turned by hand, though the forward end of the engine-to-transmission drive shaft was not rotating properly. The four bolts holding the outer coupling were loose with no torque stripe present. Additionally, two of the four bolts holding the inner coupling were missing. Two sheared bolt heads were located; the remainder of the bolts and nuts were not recovered. When removed, the forward retaining ring was still in place; however, only the center of the retainer plate was found, and the centering spring was fractured/deformed. The outer coupling was missing the three temperature plates. No visible evidence of any grease on the inner/outer coupling was observed. The gear teeth on the inner gear coupling were worn away. The aft inner/outer couplings were still attached and had minor damage. The engine-to-transmission drive shaft was sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe transmission remained attached to the upper deck via 4 of the 5 mounts. When the input shaft was rotated from the engine, a clicking noise was heard. The transmission was removed and shipped to Bell Helicopters for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo preimpact anomalies were observed with the main rotor assembly. Both main rotor blades were present and had minor damage on one leading edge. The hub assembly appeared unremarkable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cyclic moved freely in all quadrants with corresponding pitch movement at the main rotor hub. The collective was moved freely by hand and free pitch change was observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the recovered engine revealed that the engine remained secured within the engine bay with no visible external impact damage noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the airframe and engine were rinsed with fresh water following recovery from the salt water, visible signs of corrosion were noted on areas of the accessory gear box and scroll area of the engine. Manual rotation of the N1 (gas producer) drive train at the starter generator pad resulted in smooth and continuous rotation to the compressor, confirming drive train continuity. Manual rotation of the N2 (power turbine) drive train at the power take-off pad resulted in smooth and continuous rotation to the stage four turbine wheel, confirming drive train continuity. Visual and tactile examination of all engine pneumatic, fuel, and oil lines revealed no evidence of damage, and all \"B\" nuts were finger-tight with no evidence of damage or leakage. Engine and airframe interface oil and fuel lines and fittings were undamaged and secure with no evidence of leakage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe compressor displayed no evidence of impact damage. The compressor rotor blades and vanes, as well as inlet guide vanes, revealed no evidence of foreign object debris damage. The exhaust collector support appeared normal and undamaged. The turbine module was in position and displayed no damage. The outer combustion case was in normal position and displayed no damage. Both the left and right compressor air tubes were undamaged and were properly seated in both their forward and aft ends.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe power turbine governor was in normal position and appeared undamaged. The governor arm was manually rotated from stop to stop. The fuel control was in normal position and appeared undamaged. The throttle arm was manually rotated from stop to stop. The upper chip detector was void of any metal debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo evidence of mechanical anomalies was noted that would have precluded normal operation of the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe transmission was examined by the NTSB IIC at Bell Helicopter's facilities in Fort Worth, Texas. The internal transmission components were heavily corroded as a result of the time spent submerged in saltwater. The teeth of each gear were intact and displayed a wear pattern typical of normal operation. No evidence of any preimpact malfunction was observed with the transmission.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSURVIVAL ASPECTS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was a Federal Police Officer at the WWII Valor in the Pacific National Monument, reported that, following the accident, 3- 4 people dove into the water to rescue a 16-year-old passenger trapped inside the helicopter, who was seated in the aft middle seat. The officer reported that he and a Navy diver took turns with a knife, going underwater to cut the straps off the passenger. After about 5- 6 attempts, they were able to bring the passenger to the surface and CPR was immediately administered by nurses and doctors who were visiting the memorial. The officer added that an AED was also used. The officer did not remember if the passenger's life preserver was inflated or not; however, he recalled seeing yellow while underwater. In addition, the officer stated that the life preserver was tangled with the seatbelts, which, coupled with poor underwater visibility, made it difficult to extract the passenger.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother witness reported that the helicopter was underwater for about 15 minutes before the passenger was extracted from the wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA registered nurse who assisted in treatment of the passenger reported that he removed an uninflated floatation device during initial treatment.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of treatment records for the passenger revealed evidence consistent with drowning and no traumatic injuries to the head or neck. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the passenger's life preserver revealed that it was an Adult Life Preserver, model BRAVO, manufactured in January 2009 by Eastern Aero Marine, Miami, Florida. The two straps on the back of the vest, which connected to the waist band, were cut. The plastic waist band clasp functioned normally. No visible damage was noted to the inflatable portion of the vest. The carbon dioxide air cartridge used to inflate the vest was found punctured, consistent with it being used to inflate the vest. No inspections were recorded in the periodic maintenance inspection record tag on the vest.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt could not be determined when or how the life preserver was inflated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the safety video provided by Genesis Helicopters revealed that their staff was responsible for seat belting the passengers into the helicopter. In addition, the video reviewed seatbelt unbuckling procedures and life preserver use instructions. The instructions included how to inflate the vest by either pulling the red tab, which activates the air cartridge, or manually by blowing into the inflation tube. Their instructions stated, \"at no time deploy the vest while you are in the helicopter.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree of the passengers reported that they watched the safety video before boarding the helicopter. The passenger who was seated in the front left seat stated they boarded the helicopter with their life preservers on and, one-by-one, were buckled into place by either the pilot or ground crew. The three passengers all stated that that the seatbelts were difficult to unlatch following the accident sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter revealed that all five seats were equipped with 4-point seatbelt restraints, which included 2 shoulder belts and a left and right lap belt. The front left and right seat restraint buckles were equipped with a rotary buckle, which required rotation of the buckle to release the seat belt clasps. The rotary buckle attached to the shoulder restraints and opposing lap belt by sliding the clasp of the respective belt into the respective port on the buckle. The front right seat was intact. The restraints were intact, remained attached to their respective mounts, and the seat belt latch functioned normally. The inertia reel functioned normally. The front right seat exhibited downward compression damage to the seat frame and structure underneath the seat frame.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe front left seat was intact. The restraints were intact, and the seat belt latch functioned normally. The inertia reel functioned normally. The front left seat exhibited downward compression damage of the seat frame and structure underneath the seat frame.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft 3 seats were equipped with standard seatbelt buckles, which required one to lift upward on the tab to release the clasps. The shoulder harnesses were connected to the aft seat restraints by two metal connectors, which slid over the clasp before the seatbelt was buckled.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft seats were mostly intact. The aft left seat was missing the seat back cushion. The bottom of the seats exhibited an upward bow in the center, consistent with impact damage to the bottom of the fuselage. All three sets of restraints were intact. The shoulder harness inertia reels functioned normally. All of the aft seat belt latches functioned normally. The seat structure on the aft right side was damaged consistent with downward compression.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nORGINIZATIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCompany Overview&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, Genesis Helicopters employed 4 people; the owner, the pilot, a receptionist, and a maintenance assistant who performed various duties, including assisting the owner with maintenance, cleaning the helicopter, etc. They operated one helicopter, the accident helicopter, under a Letter of Authorization (LOA) from the FAA to conduct air tours within 25 statute miles of the departure airport.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Oversight Requirements and Interviews&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA surveillance of all 14 CFR Part 91 and 91 Section 147 air tour operations is outlined in FAA Order 1800.56P, National Flight Standards Work Program Guidelines. The guidance states that FAA inspectors should conduct inspections of 10 percent of all of the air tour operators that have authorizations annually. These inspections may include ramp inspections, spot inspections, review of aircraft records, or airworthiness directive compliance inspections.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Honolulu Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) had 24 employees assigned to the office at the time of the accident, of which 2 were front line managers (FLM). During the investigation, the two FLMs and the principal maintenance inspector (PMI) assigned to Genesis Helicopters were interviewed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne FLM stated that, at the time of the accident, each Part 91 LOA had three inspectors assigned for oversight as a certificate management team; a principal operations inspector (POI), a principal avionics inspector (PAI), and a PMI. The FML further stated that the national work program required the HNL FSDO conduct an aircraft records inspection or an aircraft ramp inspection on only 10 percent of the Part 91 LOA holders assigned to their office each year, and POI involvement was not required. Of the 27 LOA holders overseen by the FSDO, only 3 had specific operations that allowed for conducting air tours below 1,500 ft above ground level (agl), which required an annual flight check. The second FLM reported that the HNL FSDO was exceeding the minimum of required inspections according to the data he had recently reviewed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PMI reported that he was assigned to the Genesis Helicopters LOA around December 2015 following his on-the-job training (OJT) for ramp inspections and records inspections. The inspector stated that he was qualified for oversight of Part 91.147 LOA holders and was assigned to other operators in addition to Genesis; he was still completing OJT for oversight of Part 135 operators. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen asked how many inspectors comprised the certificate management team for Genesis, he stated that he was the PMI and was unaware of an assigned principal avionics inspector.&#x0D;\nThe PMI stated that he had not completed a ramp inspection with Genesis Helicopters since he was assigned to them; however, was trying to schedule a visit. He added that, on the morning of the accident, he called the owner to schedule a records inspection but was unable to reach anyone and left a voicemail.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe last recorded ramp or records inspection performed by the FAA on the operator that was conducted on January 3, 2013, on a different aircraft (N110JC) operating under the Genesis LOA at that time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOwner of Genesis Helicopters &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner of Genesis Helicopters was asked how often he was visited by representatives from the FAA. The owner replied, \"kind of a lot.\" He added that there was no official POI to his company but that he was visited by the FAA and had a good working relationship with them. When asked when he last received a visit from the FAA, he said it had been \"a while,\" and could not recall a specific date.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn NTSB Senior Materials Engineer examined the engine-to-transmission drive shaft along with the associated couplings and attachment hardware.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe design of the drive shaft is that each spherical coupling has an external spline profile that meshes with a matching internal spline profile on a corresponding outer coupling. Aluminum alloy cover plates are installed at the forward end of the forward outer coupling and aft end of the aft outer coupling, and springs (compressed upon installation) are placed between each cover plate and the corresponding spherical coupling. The spline couplings are grease-lubricated during assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe spline teeth on the forward (transmission side) spherical coupling were worn down to the bottom landings. Two of the attachment bolts had fractured at the transition from the bolt shank to the bolt head. The forward compression spring and forward cover plate were both fractured into multiple pieces and the spring pieces were deformed from their original shape. A comparison of the spring and cover plate fragments with their respective aft counterparts indicated that only a portion of each item was recovered. The spring and cover plate fragment fracture surfaces were examined visually with the aid of a stereomicroscope and all fractures exhibited features consistent with either overstress or rubbing/smearing due to post-separation damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward outer coupling had a dark tint consistent with exposure to elevated temperatures, and the temperature plates, which were supposed to be on the forward outer coupling, were missing. The forward end of the forward outer coupling exhibited mechanical damage around the perimeter of the forward opening. The internal spline profile exhibited comparatively minor wear marks near the middle of the spline teeth when compared to the wear on the forward spherical coupling.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNeither the forward spherical coupling nor the forward outer coupling exhibited indications of residual grease lubrication. By comparison, the aft outer coupling and spherical coupling were covered by a lubricant that was brown/black in color and viscous. The aft coupling did not exhibit any notable wear features.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe attachment bolt head fractures were examined in detail and determined to be consistent with cadmium-induced embrittlement of the steel at elevated temperature. The bolts were type NAS 1304-10 and were made of a low alloy steel with a cadmium-plated coating. Both bolt heads were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The fracture surface had a faceted appearance, consistent with intergranular fracture. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of the fracture surface and a portion of the bolt indicated the presence of oxygen and cadmium in addition to the elements associated with the base metal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn EDS spectrum indicated of a portion of the bolt revealed the presence of oxygen and cadmium in addition to other elements in the steel bolt. The observations were consistent with cadmium-induced embrittlement of the steel at elevated temperature. The hardness of the sectioned bolt head and of a bolt head from the aft coupling were measured. The results indicated that the forward coupling bolt head had been tempered, consistent with exposure to elevated temperatures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor more information, see the Materials Laboratory Report within the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Regulations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA LOA for Genesis Helicopters, the operator must follow 14 CFR 91.147, and air tour flights for compensation or hire must remain within 25sm of the departure point.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was repositioning the helicopter (with a flight nurse and flight paramedic on board) to its base following an air ambulance flight. The paramedic, who survived the accident, reported that after refueling, they departed and headed east towards mountainous terrain; peak elevations were 5,700 to 6,000 ft. About 10 minutes after takeoff, the helicopter entered the mountainous terrain, and the height of the helicopter above the terrain began to vary as the terrain elevation rose and fell. During the final few minutes of the flight, the helicopter's altitude above the ground varied between 30 ft and 770 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 30 seconds before impact, the helicopter flew east over a north-south canyon and continued through a saddle on the canyon's east wall, clearing the terrain by about 30 ft. As the helicopter passed over the eastern ridgeline, it banked to the right and reached a ground speed of about 120 knots. After the helicopter cleared the ridge, it started to descend and accelerate. The ground speed reached a maximum of 148 knots, and about 10 seconds later, there was an abrupt increase in the helicopter's pitch and right roll rates, consistent with right and aft cyclic inputs. According to the paramedic, around this time, the pilot said an expletive in a panicked voice. The paramedic looked up and saw a ridgeline immediately in their flight path and terrain filling up the view. The paramedic described the subsequent motions of the helicopter as a violent hard right bank, and he stated that the pilot did not say anything else but was making jerky, fast hand movements. The flight characteristics seconds before impact, as described by the paramedic and shown in flight data, were consistent with a rapid onset of servo transparency. The helicopter impacted terrain on the northwest facing slope of a ridgeline, near a saddle, at an elevation of about 5,035 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nServo Transparency begins when the aerodynamic forces acting to change the pitch of the rotor blades exceed the hydraulic servo actuators' capability to resist those forces and maintain the commanded blade pitch angles. The force deficit is then transmitted back to the pilot's cyclic and collective controls. On clockwise turning main rotor systems such as the AS350B3, the right servo receives the highest load when maneuvering (retreating blade), resulting in an uncommanded right and aft cyclic motion accompanied by down collective movement. The NTSB's Servo Transparency Study for accident No. LAX03MA292 notes that the pilot's control force required to counter this aerodynamically-induced phenomena \"tends to be progressive\" and is \"proportional to the severity of the maneuver,\" and \"may give a pilot who is not aware of this phenomenon an impression that the controls are jammed.\" If the pilot does not reduce the maneuver, the aircraft will roll right and pitch-up, but the phenomenon normally lasts less than 2 seconds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe general load on the main rotor increases under the following conditions: high speed, high torque (increase in collective pitch), high g-load, and increase in density altitude. Although the helicopter will self-correct and recover from the servo transparency, the potential exists for a significant flight path deviation. The onset of servo transparency is rapid and could conceivably lead to a helicopter in a right turn exceeding 90º of bank before the pilot was able to recognize what was happening and react accordingly. The associated transition from light and responsive controls to heavy controls that require considerable force to counter the uncommanded maneuver, could cause an unsuspecting pilot to believe that he was experiencing a malfunction, rather than a known characteristic of the helicopter when maneuvered at the published performance limits.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Operation Control Center mistakenly lost tracking of the helicopter about 2 hours and 10 minutes after the accident occurred. Another company helicopter was then sent to search for the accident helicopter and located the wreckage about 50 minutes later. Due to the mountainous terrain and limited access to the accident site, another helicopter responded to the area about 4 hours after the accident and was capable of hoisting medics to the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe emergency locator transmitter (ELT) did not activate during the accident sequence, resulting in the delayed response of the search and rescue teams. Examination of the ELT revealed that the G-switches in the unit failed to activate due to a powdery residue from internal wear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's autopsy identified a lesion in his brain consistent with a cavernous hemangioma. No bleeding or other acute finding around the cavernous hemangioma was described by the autopsy report, and no other natural disease was identified. Given the paramedic's description of the flight indicating that the pilot was actively flying, it is unlikely that the cavernous hemangioma contributed to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the paramedic, the flight nurse survived the impact and was initially awake and alert, but over time, he became increasingly short of breath and eventually stopped talking and breathing. An injury study was completed on the flight nurse to evaluate whether improved communication regarding the timing and location of the crash, such as through a functioning ELT, could have allowed him to survive. Given the flight nurse's injury severity, particularly to the chest, the amount of internal bleeding, and the fact that he was wet and exposed with minimal clothing in 20°F temperature, it is unlikely that he would have survived until help arrived even if the initial notification of the crash had occurred more rapidly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo evidence was found of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. Examination of the accident site and wreckage revealed that the helicopter impacted terrain in a right bank and level attitude.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 15, 2015, about 1723 mountain standard time, an Airbus, AS350 B3 helicopter, N74317, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain while maneuvering near Superior, Arizona. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Air Methods Corporation, doing business as Native Air Ambulance, under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135.  The commercial pilot and the flight nurse sustained fatal injuries, and the flight paramedic sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a company visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan was filed for the repositioning flight. The cross-country flight originated about 1708 from the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (IWA), Mesa, Arizona, with an intended destination of Globe, Arizona.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the helicopter was based in Globe and had transported a patient from the Cobre Valley Community Hospital in Globe to the Baywood Heart Hospital in Mesa. After transporting the patient, the pilot flew the helicopter to IWA for refueling before the return flight to Globe. (See figure 1)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Figure 1-Overview of FlightsThe flight paramedic stated that after refueling, they departed IWA and headed east toward the Superstition Mountains. Local radar and flight data obtained from an onboard Appareo GAU2000 \"data logger\" device showed that the helicopter departed IWA about 1708 and headed east-northeast maintaining an altitude of about 500 ft above ground level (agl). The helicopter made a 360° right hand turn over the small community of Gold Canyon at 1715. According to the flight paramedic, the flight nurse's daughter was outside her house in the small community, waving as they flew by at 400-500 ft agl. Over the next 4 minutes, the flight track continued east along the south side of the Superstition Mountains at or below 500 ft agl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1719, the helicopter entered mountainous terrain, and the height of the helicopter above the terrain began to vary as the terrain elevation rose and fell. Between 1718 and 1720, the altitude varied between 240 ft agl and 1,150 ft agl. Between 1720 and the end of the flight, the altitude varied between 30 ft agl and 770 ft agl. About 1721, the helicopter turned from a heading of about 80° to a heading of about 45° and followed a canyon beneath its ridgelines. (See figure 2)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Figure 2-Aerial View of Accident FlightThe helicopter flew nearly perpendicularly over the north-south oriented Rogers Canyon, and at 1723:07, it continued through a saddle on the canyon's east wall, clearing the terrain by about 30 ft. As it passed over the eastern ridgeline, the helicopter banked to the right, changing from a ground track of about 43° to 76°, and reached a ground speed of about 120 knots. After the helicopter cleared the ridge, it started to descend and accelerate. The ground speed reached a maximum of 148 knots at 1723:21. The helicopter banked right (about 5° to 10° of roll), and its heading changed from 76° at 1723:18 to about 90° at 1723:32. (See figure 3)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Figure 3-Aerial View of the Accident Flight and Accident FlightAt 1723:32, the GAU2000 recorded an abrupt increase in the helicopter's pitch rate and right roll rate, consistent with right and aft cyclic inputs. According to the paramedic, around this time, the pilot said an expletive in a panicked voice. The paramedic looked up and saw a ridgeline immediately in their flight path and terrain filling up the view. The paramedic described the subsequent motions of the helicopter as a violent hard right bank, and he stated that the pilot did not say anything else but was making jerky fast hand movements. The helicopter impacted terrain on the northwest facing slope of a ridgeline, near a saddle, at an elevation of about 5,035 ft mean sea level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 51, held commercial pilot and flight instructor certificates, both with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second-class airman medical certificate was issued on December 8, 2015, with the limitation that he must have available glasses for near vision.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of company documentation revealed that he had accumulated about 5,670 hours of flight experience of which about 2,117 hours were in the same make and model as the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot completed his initial company training in September 2014. He received his most recent annual 14 CFR 135.293 and 135.299 airman competency/proficiency check on August 22, 2015.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe paramedic stated that the pilot was the safety officer at the Globe base and took the job very seriously. He stated that the pilot flew lower than the other pilots but was never dangerously low. The pilot was one of his favorites to fly with because he was very helpful and would aid the medical crew with duties such as cleaning out the stretchers. He did not think that the pilot took risks or operated dangerously.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter, serial number 4317, was manufactured in March 2007. At the time of the accident, the helicopter had accumulated about 4,236 flight hours. The helicopter was equipped with a Turbomeca Arriel 2B1 turboshaft engine, which had accumulated about 2,491 hours. The helicopter's weight at the time of the accident was about 4,801 pounds, which was less than the maximum gross weight of 4,961 pounds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the helicopter was maintained under an FAA-approved aircraft inspection program. Helicopter logbook records showed the following maintenance events during the days before the accident:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n•\tDecember 15, 2015: daily check of the tail rotor laminated half bearings for deterioration&#x0D;\n•\tDecember 14, 2015: 10-hour inspection&#x0D;\n•\tDecember 10, 2015: 10-, 15-hour/7-day, 25- and 30-hour inspections&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an Artex Aircraft Supplies, INC., (now ACR Electronics Inc.), C406-N HM Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT), part number 453-5061 (serial number 04326). According to the manufacturer's original documents for that serial number, the ELT was manufactured in October 2007. The helicopter records indicated that the ELT was installed in May 2008 by Texas Aviation Services. The ELT battery, part number 452-0133 (serial number 359028-018), was recorded as being installed in May 2015. The last maintenance that occurred was recorded as consisting of a check per 14 CFR 91.207 (d) on October 29, 2015.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Airbus AS350 B3 is equipped with a single hydraulic system, which provides 600-psi hydraulic boost to the cyclic, collective, and tail rotor controls. The main rotor control system consists of a series of rigid rods interconnected by bell cranks and reversing levers. The respective control linkages interface with the swash plate through three hydraulic servo actuators, which are designed to exert the necessary control force. If the required control force exceeds the maximum force that can be provided by the available servo pressure, the hydraulic system reaches its limitation, and the remaining required force must be supplied by the pilot via the flight controls. This can be felt by an apparent stiffening of the controls, which become gradually heavier to operate. The phenomenon that then arises is called servo transparency. Servo transparency is also known as hydraulic transparency, servo reversibility, and jack stall. In short, servo transparency begins when the aerodynamic forces acting to change the pitch of the rotor blades exceed the hydraulic servo actuators' capability to resist those forces and maintain the commanded blade pitch angles. The NTSB has examined the servo transparency phenomenon before, during the investigation of a September 30, 2003 accident involving an Aerospatiale (Eurocopter, now Airbus Helicopters) AS350BA helicopter in the Grand Canyon (NTSB # LAX03MA292), and produced a \"Servo Transparency Study.\" That Study located in the public docket for LAX03MA292, describes servo transparency as follows:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to [Airbus], servo transparency is a condition when the forces exerted from the rotor system overcome the force handling capability (output) of the flight control hydraulic actuators. The condition manifests itself when the aerodynamic forces of the main rotor system in flight are higher than that of the hydraulic servo control force. The main rotor system forces are transmitted (feedback) back through the flight control pushrod/bellcrank system through all three main servos of the AS350 helicopter to the pilot's controls. The feedback forces usually occur only during extreme maneuvering. The servo transparency is also known as hydraulic transparency, servo reversibility, and jack stall. ...&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to [Airbus], servo transparency begins when the aerodynamic forces generated by the main rotor system exceed the hydraulic forces from the control system and the difference between the forces is transmitted back to the pilot's cyclic and collective controls. On clockwise turning main rotor systems, the right servo receives the highest load when maneuvering, so when servo transparency condition occurs, it results in an uncommanded right and aft cyclic motion accompanied by down collective movement. The force transmitted through the controls tends to be progressive and the feed back forces through the controls could give an unaware pilot the impression that the controls are very hard to move or are jammed. The amplitude of the induced control feedback loads is proportional to the severity of the maneuver, but the phenomenon normally lasts less than 2 seconds when the pilot is aware of the condition and relaxes the pressure on the flight controls. ...&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 4, 2003, Eurocopter published Service Letter No. 1648-29-03 concerning servo transparency. In the service letter, pilots were advised about the servo transparency phenomenon, what happens during the event, how it manifests itself, factors that increase the likelihood of encountering the condition, what to do in the event it is encountered, and the best way to avoid the condition. According to Eurocopter, servo transparency occurs smoothly and is not dangerous, if properly anticipated by a pilot during an abrupt or excessive high load maneuver, such as high positive g turn or pull-up. ...&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA issued a Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) on January 23, 2004, concerning servo transparency in the AS350 and EC120 series helicopters.... The SAIB referenced Eurocopter's Service Bulletin and advised helicopter pilots of these helicopters that they (the pilot) should follow (not fight) the control movement. Pilots should allow the collective pitch to decrease to reduce the overall load. The pilot should be aware that as the load is reduced, hydraulic assistance will be restored and force being applied to the controls could result in undesired opposite control movement. The SAIB advises pilots to follow the aircraft limitations in accordance with the Aircraft Flight Manual.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n6 Maneuvering Limitations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    •     Continued operation in servo transparency (where load feedback is felt in the controls) is prohibited.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    \n    •     Maximum load factor is a combination of TAS, Hs and gross weight. Avoid such combinations at high values associated with high collective pitch.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    \n    •     Transparency may be reached during maneuvers, steep turns, hard pull-up or when maneuvering near Vne. Self-correcting, the phenomenon will induce an uncommanded right cyclic load and an associated collective down reaction. However, even if the transparency feedback loads are fully controllable, immediate action is required to relieve the feed back loads: reduce the severity of the maneuver, follow the aircraft's natural reaction, let the collective pitch decrease naturally (avoid low pitch) and smoothly counteract the right cyclic motion.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    \n    •     Transparency will disappear as soon as excessive loads are relieved. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    \nThe SAIB states that pilots should understand that servo transparency is a natural phenomenon for any flyable helicopter. Basic airmanship should prevent encountering this phenomenon by avoiding combinations of high speed, high gross weight, high-density altitude, and aggressive maneuvers, which exceed the aircraft's approved flight limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe LAX03MA092 Servo Transparency Study also notes that \"the AS350 helicopter was flight tested during its original certification process in 1985. During the flight tests the servo transparency condition was noted versus changes in gross weight, altitude, and airspeed.\" Furthermore:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AS350 helicopter was tested again during December 2003 for the effects of servo transparency by Eurocopter's Chief test pilot and an FAA test pilot.... According to the flight test results, servo transparency was impossible to encounter if the collective is less than 50% raised. With a speed of less than 100 knots, servo transparency was very difficult to enter. According to the flight test results, all of the entries and sustainment in the servo transparency region were accomplished with deliberate high g-forces, at high gross weights, at very high entry airspeeds, and were very difficult to sustain. All of the servo transparency conditions were exited immediately when the collective was reduced.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the Superior, AZ accident, Airbus Helicopters issued two Safety Information Notices (SINs) that are relevant to the circumstances of the accident, and to the servo transparency phenomenon in particular. SIN 3093-S-00, issued on October 25, 2016, discusses safety items to be considered during flight close to or at VNE; and SIN 3287-S-67, issued on November 20, 2018, discusses servo transparency. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSIN 3093 provides the following \"Operational precautions at VNE:\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- avoid continuous flight at VNE as much as possible,&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- flight close to VNE should be conducted with smooth inputs on the controls,&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- the time spent close to VNE should be limited, with a return to normal cruise airspeeds as soon as possible, in&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\norder to ensure operational margins if maneuvering is required,&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- VNE at low altitude should be avoided,&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- high pitch changes should be avoided close to VNE,&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- high bank angles should be avoided close to VNE.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe precaution that \"VNE at low altitude should be avoided\" is particularly relevant to the circumstances of the Superior, AZ accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSIN 3287 reminds operators that the servo-transparency phenomenon is described and explained in the Eurocopter Service letter and FAA SAIB cited above. In addition, the SIN states that&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIf nothing is done by the pilot to decrease the maneuver force and counter the gradual increase of the control load (tendency for nose-up and RH roll), this phenomenon can cause risks if it occurs while the aircraft is operated close to the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirbus Helicopters insists on the importance to comply with the limitations of the Flight Manual/RFM and prevent forceful or excessive maneuvers at all times moreover with a heavy aircraft at high speed and high density altitude; even more when aircraft is operated close to the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1715 the automated weather observation station at the Coolidge Municipal Airport (P08), Coolidge, Arizona, located about 38 miles south southwest of the accident site, reported wind was from 310° at 5 knots, sky clear, temperature 9° C, dew point -4° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.99 inches of mercury. Using the reported weather conditions and the accident site elevation (5,037 ft), the calculated density altitude was about 5,089 ft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1647 the automated weather observation station and the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport, Mesa, Arizona, located about 30 miles west-southwest of the accident site, reported wind from 300° at 5 knots, visibility 45 statute miles, few clouds at 7,000 ft msl, temperature 11° C, dew point -5° C, and an altimeter setting of 30.00 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Astronomical Applications Department at the United States Naval Observatory, sunset was at 1718; the end of civil twilight was at 1746; and moonset was at 2152. At 1730, the sun was -3.0° below the horizon at an azimuth of 243.9°. The moon was 40.5° above the horizon and visible as a waxing crescent with 20% of the moon's visible disk illuminated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was in mountainous terrain about 18 miles west of the Globe base, and the surrounding peaks, about 1 to 1.5 miles from the accident site, ranged in height from about 5,700 to 6,000 ft. Examination of the accident site revealed a debris field that was about 330 ft in length on a magnetic heading of about 230°.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe first identified points of contact were multiple cuts through two bushes that were about 2 ft apart. The bushes were evenly cut at an angle of about 45° to the horizon. Downhill of the two bushes, four divots were cut from the soil that were, each about 18 inches long, 12 inches wide and 3 inches deep; the divots spanned a length of about 20 ft. The multiple cuts in the bushes and the divots were consistent with main rotor blade strikes. Two bushes with broken branches and the red lens cover from the beacon located on the lower side of the helicopter's fuselage were located about 12 ft uphill from the divots. Surrounding this area were fragments of rotor blade material.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 62 ft from the main rotor strikes, along the debris field, was a small clearing containing a shallow elongated crater that measured about 1 ft wide and 3 ft long. In this clearing were large broken branches and the helicopter's right step and forward right toe skid. The debris path continued level along the slope for 64 ft to the tail rotor assembly. About midway between the crater and the tail rotor assembly, the helicopter doors, right side engine cowling, broken interior paneling, gurney, and medic bag were found. About 5 ft further were two helmets identified as belonging to the flight nurse and flight paramedic. About 10 ft from the helmets were the helicopter's left step and forward left toe skid.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuselage was located about 40 ft downslope from the tail rotor assembly. The fuselage came to rest on its right side, and the cabin roof was found in sections near the fuselage. The forward cabin floor had separated, and the remaining fuselage forward of the forward skid mounting legs was bent upward about 30°. The pilot's seat remained attached to the fuselage. The floor structure and the pilot's seat rails were buckled and distorted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rear cabin modular seating system consisted of a single seat on the left and two seats on the right separated by a medical equipment console. The modular seating system separated from the rear cabin wall and was located on the ground below the fuselage. The two right seats remained attached to the lower horizontal support bracket and were found near the right skid. The seat bottoms separated from the seat backs near the hinge locations. Both seat belt buckles were unlatched. The single left seat separated from the rear support brackets. The single left seat bottom was found near the main rotor hub. The left seat belt was unbuckled, and the belt webbing was taut around a portion the main rotor head. The single left seat back was found near the main rotor head and remained attached to the seat belts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was exposed and was separated from the main and tail rotor drive shafts. The engine remained attached to the fuselage and was crushed and distorted at the exhaust. The main rotor hub and blades remained attached and were located below the fuselage. The blades had deformation and delamination from the mid-sections to the tips. The yellow main rotor blade was frayed at the tip. The tail boom, forward of the horizontal stabilizer, was partially attached to the fuselage. The fuel tank's right side was visible and intact. Fuel leaked from the right rear access panel during the onsite examination. The ground, downslope of the main wreckage, was saturated in fuel. The instrument console separated from the cabin area and was found in the top of a tree about 200 ft down the debris field from the tail rotor assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor blades had minor damage. The tail rotor system rotated freely when turned through by hand at the tail rotor drive shaft. The tail rotor drive shaft was still attached to the tail rotor gear box input shaft flex coupling.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ELT did not activate during the accident sequence. The ELT remained attached to its mount and antenna and was undamaged. When the wreckage was positioned on a flatbed trailer during recovery, the ELT activated and was subsequently shut off.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of his most recent medical certification examination, the pilot reported using the drug metoprolol. Metoprolol is a prescription medication used to treat high blood pressure and to prevent recurrent heart attacks; it is not generally considered to be impairing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Pinal County Sheriff's Office, Pinal County, Arizona performed an autopsy of the pilot. The cause of death for the pilot was reported as multiple blunt force injuries. In addition to his injuries, the autopsy identified a 3- by 2.5- by 2.5-centimeter spongiform red lesion within the white matter of the left temporal/occipital lobe of brain; the lesion was consistent with a cavernous hemangioma. These lesions may be congenital or acquired, and if they are asymptomatic, the treatment is benign observation. Only if the person develops seizures or other neurologic symptoms are more invasive treatments indicated. No bleeding or other acute finding in the area of the cavernous hemangioma was described by the autopsy report, and no other natural disease was identified.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed forensic toxicology on specimens from the pilot. The tests were negative for carbon monoxide and ethanol. Metoprolol was detected during tests for drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight nurse's injuries included multiple rib fractures with a left-sided flail chest as well as intraabdominal injuries with significant associated bleeding into both the thoracic and abdominal cavities (total of 1300 cc of blood in the cavities). The flight nurse's Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 22.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe injuries were coded using the abbreviated injury scale (AIS) system that applies a severity score of 1 (minimal) to 6 (maximal) to each injury; these are grouped into 9 body regions. The ISS predicts the likelihood of survival among traumatically injured individuals and can be used to compare the severity of injury among individuals. To calculate the ISS, the squares of the maximum AIS scores for each of the three highest scoring body regions are added together. ISSs are routinely divided into four groups: minor (ISS 1-8), moderate (ISS 9-15), severe (ISS 16-24), and very severe (ISS &gt;25). See the Injury Factual Report in the docket for further information.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSURVIVAL ASPECTS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe paramedic stated that he never lost consciousness during the impact sequence, and the helicopter came to rest with him hanging off the left side of the fuselage suspended by the straps of his seatbelt harness. His helmet and glasses had come off, and he cut himself out of the harness and slid down to the snow. The paramedic recalled hearing the pilot take his last breaths, but he never heard him say anything. The flight nurse began to talk to him and said that he was pinned under the helicopter's right skid. He asked the paramedic for help, but the paramedic was unable to move due to his injuries. The paramedic had become soaked in fuel and was worried that the wreckage was going to catch on fire. The fuel continued to pour out of the wreckage in a continuous steady stream.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the paramedic, he and the flight nurse tried to use their cell phones but did not have any reception. The nurse told the paramedic that he was having difficulty breathing and believed his lung had collapsed. Once the sun went down, they became very cold, and the nurse's breathing became very labored. Shortly thereafter, the nurse passed away. Sometime later, the paramedic heard a helicopter in the distance, and because of the darkness, he turned his cell phone light on to signal the helicopter as to his location (assuming that they would likely be wearing night vision goggles and would be able to see the light). A helicopter orbited over him, and then another helicopter came shortly thereafter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight was being tracked by satellite at the operator's national communication center, AIRCOM, in Omaha, Nebraska. The company's operations control center (OCC), located in Denver, Colorado, was monitoring the flight on their Flight Management System.  At 1723, satellite tracking of the helicopter was lost, but was not noticed by personnel until about 2 hours and 10 minutes later. AIRCOM notified the OCC, and a search was conducted by a company aircraft. The wreckage was located about 50 minutes later as a result of an aerial search. Due to the mountainous terrain and limited access to the accident site, another helicopter responded to the area and at 2154 hoisted medics to the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to first responders, the pilot was found in his seat with his helmet on and his seat belt fastened. Both the flight nurse and the paramedic were found outside the fuselage and unsecured from their restraints. The flight nurse lay parallel to the right skid and was pinned underneath the forward right skid leg, which crossed over the top of his neck and jaw. The paramedic was downhill from the main wreckage and lay parallel to a main rotor blade.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEST AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAppareo Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing recovery of the helicopter, the on-board recording devices consisting of Appareo RMS 2000 was removed and sent to the NTSB's Vehicle Recorder Division for read-out. The data imaging process was successful, and the accident flight was downloaded to the SD card. A report of the component examination from the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory is contained in the NTSB public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDigital Engine Electronic Control Unit Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe digital engine electronic control unit (DECU), and the vehicle and engine multi-function display (VEMD) were removed from the helicopter and shipped to the helicopter manufacturer. Under the supervision of the NTSB, the components were downloaded, and the data showed that the engine was providing power at the time of terrain impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nELT Testing&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ELT was sent to the manufacturer for testing. During the G-switch centrifuge test, the primary 2.3G-switch did not activate nor did the 5-axis 12.5G-switch assembly, a small circuit board that has 5 individual switches wired in parallel. Both G-switches were removed from the ELT and x-rayed at the NTSB materials laboratory. The x-rays revealed that the primary G-switch's acceleration spring was bent to one side of the switch housing, resulting in the spring not sitting centered on the ball. Also, one of the individual switches in the 5-axis switch assembly showed an improper resting position of the piston; the piston was about halfway through the housing and compressed the spring.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth G-switches were sent to the switch manufacturer for further testing and examination. During the testing, the primary G-switch activated 1 time out of about 30 tests. The 5-axis G-switch assembly remained intact for the testing; during the testing, one of the individual switches activated normally; and the other four did not activate. The primary G-switch and the 5 individual switches of the 5-axis G-switch assembly were opened. Internal examination of the primary G-switch revealed a black powder residue on the spring, ball, contact area and the housing internal surface areas. Internal examination of the 5-axis G-switches revealed wear signatures on the outer circumference of the pistons.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDetailed reports of the ELT examinations are contained in the NTSB public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPerformance Calculations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGiven load factor, density altitude, and helicopter gross weight, a servo transparency parameter (STP) can be calculated that defines the helicopter's proximity to flight conditions susceptible to the servo transparency phenomenon. Estimates of the STP were calculated using information recorded on and derived from the GAU2000 data. At 1723:32, as the helicopter started a relatively abrupt right roll, the STP was well below the threshold for the servo transparency condition and of similar magnitude to its values during the previous 21 seconds. However, as the load factor increased along with the roll angle to the right, the STP quickly climbed toward values consistent with the onset of the servo transparency condition. The STP value crossed the threshold for the servo transparency condition at 1723:34 and continued to increase until about 1723:39 (about a second before the end of the recorded data). See the Helicopter Performance Memorandum in the public docket for further information about servo transparency and the calculation of the servo transparency parameter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot of the helicopter air ambulance flight, which was operating under visual flight rules, departed in night visual meteorological conditions (VMC) to transport a patient from Porterville, California, to a hospital in Bakersfield, California; a flight nurse and a paramedic were also aboard the helicopter. GPS data indicated that, after takeoff, the helicopter proceeded on a southerly course paralleling a highway and ascended to a maximum GPS altitude of 1,554 ft with groundspeeds varying between 124 and 144 mph. About 13 minutes after takeoff, the helicopter began to descend; 20 seconds later, the helicopter entered a left descending turn with groundspeeds that initially increased and then decreased. According to the last 6 seconds of GPS data, the descent rate of the helicopter was about 2,210 ft per minute.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough both the departure airport and an airport near the helicopter's intended destination reported VMC shortly after the accident flight began, no recorded weather observation stations were located along the route of flight. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service field office nearest to the accident site indicated that the conditions at the time and the location of the accident were conducive to fog. They also referenced a Twitter post from an individual that observed fog in the area of McFarland, however the Twitter post was unavailable. The pilot of the helicopter that located the wreckage about 1 hour, 51 minutes after the accident reported ground fog in the area. In addition, that pilot stated that he encountered heavy rainfall in the general search area. Thus, it is likely that the accident pilot encountered an area of reduced visibility due to rain or fog.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site indicated that the helicopter impacted open, sparsely populated, unlit, and hilly terrain in a descending left turn. Postaccident examination of the helicopter structure, systems, and engine revealed no evidence of any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator used two Bell 407 helicopters for helicopter air ambulance operations; one was equipped with an advanced (glass cockpit) instrument display system (the accident helicopter), and one was equipped with analog instruments. A review of the pilot's logbook and company records revealed that the pilot had primarily flown the Bell 407 helicopter that was equipped with analog instruments. The pilot's commercial pilot certificate included an instrument helicopter rating, so he most likely had the operational skills necessary to safely conduct a flight in a familiar helicopter. However, during the almost 7 months preceding the accident, the pilot had 11.2 hours of total flight experience in the accident helicopter that included 2.3 hours of night flight time, of which 2 hours comprised of night flight training and night vision goggles (NVG) training about 4 months before the accident. The pilot had logged .3 hours of night time in the accident helicopter 48 hours prior to the accident.  Thus, the pilot lacked recent nighttime experience with the accident helicopter's advanced avionics, which may have increased his susceptibility to spatial disorientation or loss of control during maneuvering flight.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 10, 2015, at 1903 Pacific standard time, a Bell 407 helicopter, N408FC, was destroyed when it impacted terrain during cruise flight near McFarland, California. The commercial pilot, flight paramedic, flight nurse, and patient sustained fatal injuries. The helicopter was registered to American Airborne EMS, Fresno, California, and was operated by Rogers Helicopters, Inc., doing business as SkyLife, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 Air Medical Flight as call sign SkyLife 4.  Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a company visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan was filed. The cross-country flight originated from the Porterville Municipal Airport (PVT), Porterville, California, at 1849 with an intended destination of San Joaquin Community Hospital, Bakersfield, California.        &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInformation provided by the helicopter operator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and local law enforcement officials indicated that the helicopter was initially dispatched from Visalia Municipal Airport (VIS), Visalia, California, to facilitate the transfer of a patient from PVT to a hospital helipad in Bakersfield. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nData recovered from a handheld Garmin GPSMap 396 GPS unit revealed that the helicopter departed from VIS about 1734, arrived at PVT about 1756. The operator's check pilot stated that he talked with the accident pilot via telephone about 1800. During this conversation, the accident pilot told the check pilot that he had just arrived at PVT and had checked the weather for Bakersfield, noting that visibility of 6 miles had been reported. The check pilot expressed his concern that the weather would be worse in the area than predicted. The accident pilot agreed and stated that he would carefully check the weather for the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight departed from PVT at 1849:47. The recorded data showed that the helicopter was on a southerly course, along State Highway 65, and that the helicopter ascended to a GPS altitude of about 1,000 ft for the first 6 minutes 11 seconds of the flight with groundspeeds that varied between 125 mph and 141 mph. Beginning at 1855:58, the helicopter continued along a southerly course and began to ascend, reaching a maximum GPS altitude of 1,554 ft at 1902:43; the groundspeed varied between 124 and 144 mph.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBetween 1903:08 and 1903:20, the helicopter's GPS altitude decreased from 1,535 to 1,476 ft, and the groundspeed increased from 135 to 138 mph, while the helicopter flew along a magnetic heading of 185°. At 1903:28, the helicopter began a left turn while descending through 1,300 ft at a groundspeed of 141 mph. The last three recorded data points—at 1903:32, 1903:35, and 1903:38—showed that the helicopter continued to descend; the GPS did not indicate a groundspeed for the last data point, which was recorded when the helicopter was about 590 ft southwest of the accident site. The calculated rate of descent for the last three data points was 2,210 ft per minute. Figure 1 shows the GPS-derived data points between 1902:43 and 1903:38. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1927, the dispatcher radioed the pilot to determine the flight's status but did not receive a response. The dispatcher contacted personnel at the destination hospital and Meadows Field Airport (BFL), Bakersfield, California, and learned that the flight had not reached the intended destination. An FAA alert notification was issued at 2034, and the helicopter wreckage was located by pilots in a sheriff's office helicopter at 2054. The pilot-in-command of the sheriff's office helicopter reported that, during the search for the accident helicopter, he observed dense ground fog between 200 and 500 ft above ground level and encountered heavy rainfall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. Final eight GPS-recorded data points.PERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 49, held a commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft helicopter and instrument rotorcraft ratings and a flight instructor certificate with rotorcraft helicopter and instrument helicopter ratings. He held a second-class medical certificate dated April 8, 2015, with the limitation \"must wear corrective lenses.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCompany records and the pilot's most recent logbook showed that the pilot was hired on August 15, 2012 and conducted mostly ferry flights and LIDAR utility work in Bell 206 and McDonnell Douglas MD530 and MD500 helicopters. On June 4, 2015, the pilot was reassigned to the Bell 407 with a special training authorization for emergency medical services. Before his employment with Rogers Helicopters, the pilot conducted air tours mostly in the Airbus Helicopters AS350 BA helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to his most recent logbook, with entries dated from August 27, 2009, to December 10, 2015 the pilot had accumulated 11,415.3 hours of total flight experience, 159.3 hours of which were at night. The logbook also showed that, between August 27, 2009, and the accident date, the pilot had accumulated 17.8 hours of night flight experience; 4 hours of flight in actual instrument conditions; and 55.3 hours of simulated instrument time, including 0.5 hours in the accident helicopter between May 30 and June 4, 2015.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBetween May 28, 2015, and the accident date, the pilot had accumulated 48.8 hours of total flight experience in the Bell 407, 11.2 hours of which were in the accident helicopter. During this timeframe, he accumulated 15 hours of night flight time, including 2.3 hours in the accident helicopter, which comprised 2 hours of night training that included 0.78 hours of night vision goggle (NVG) training. During the 90 days that preceded the accident, the pilot had accumulated 5.2 hours of night flight time, including 0.3 hours in the accident helicopter 2 days before the accident. A review of FAA records indicated that the pilot had not flown a helicopter equipped with advanced avionics (glass cockpit displays) before his first flight in the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a postaccident interview, the pilot's wife reported that he expressed numerous concerns about not having NVG. She stated that the pilot had started, but had not yet completed, company NVG training. In addition, she stated that the pilot's night training was limited but that, with his skill level, he was \"fine\" with night flying; however, he wasn't comfortable flying at night without the use of NVG's.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n A company pilot also reported that the accident pilot expressed concern about flying near terrain in the area during periods of darkness without the use of NVG's.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter, serial number 53450, was configured for helicopter air ambulance (HAA) operations. The FAA type certificate required one flight crewmember (a pilot) and permitted operations under day or night visual flight rules (VFR). The helicopter was equipped with a Garmin G500H glass cockpit system, which was installed in February 2013. As shown in figure 2, the system comprised a Garmin GDU 620 primary flight display and multifunction display, a Garmin GRS 77 attitude heading reference system (AHRS), and a Garmin GDC 74 air data computer. The helicopter also had an analog airspeed indicator and altimeter; however, no additional attitude reference instruments were installed. The helicopter was also configured for the use NVG's.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Figure 2. Garmin G500H system similar to that installed in N408FC (the accident helicopter) , Obtained from Garmin.Com.&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was powered by a Rolls-Royce model M250-C47B turboshaft engine, serial number CAE-847778, with maximum takeoff and maximum continuous power ratings of 650 and 600 shaft horsepower, respectively. A review of the airframe logbooks showed that the helicopter's most recent annual inspection completed on June 1, 2015, with an airframe total time of 9,017.5 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot primarily flew another company Bell 407 helicopter, N101HF, that was also configured for HAA operations. As shown in figure 3, this helicopter had analog instruments and not the advanced avionics installed in the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3. Analog instruments installed in N101HF.METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1854, the recorded weather conditions at PTV, elevation 443 ft msl, located about 21 nautical miles (nm) north of the accident site, were as follows:  wind from 040° at 5 knots, visibility 10 statute miles or greater, light rain, overcast ceiling at 3,300 ft, temperature and dew point of 12°C, and altimeter setting 29.91 inches of mercury. At 1854, the recorded weather conditions at BFL, located about 14 nm south of the accident location, were as follows: wind from 280° at 4 knots, visibility 10 statute miles or greater, ceiling overcast at 6,000 ft, temperature of 14°C, dew point 11°C, and altimeter setting 29.91 inches of mercury. No weather reporting stations were located along the route of flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest National Weather Service Weather (NWS) Surveillance Radar-1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) was located in the San Joaquin Valley, California, about 47 nm northwest of the accident site. The WSR-88D captured base reflectivity imagery at 1902, as shown in figure 4, which mainly depicted light to moderate values of reflectivity to the east, northeast, north, and northwest of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4. WSR-88D base reflectivity imagery.The NWS Weather Forecast Office (WFO) in Hanford, California, issued an area forecast discussion at 1516. It noted areas of marginal visual/instrument conditions with mountain obscurations in clouds and precipitation developing over the Sierra Nevada mountains near Yosemite, California, and spreading south through the day.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) advisories for instrument conditions, mountain obscuration, and moderate turbulence were in effect for the accident site at the accident time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident discussion with meteorologists at the NWS Weather Forecast Office in Hanford indicated that the conditions about the time and near the location of the accident were conducive to fog. The WFO referenced a Twitter post from an individual that observed fog in the area of McFarland, however this Twitter post was unavailable.  The NWS meteorologists indicated that ground fog near the accident region is commonly relatively shallow and suggested common depths are 150 to 300 feet agl. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor further meteorological information, see the weather study in the public docket for this investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted open, sparsely populated, unlit, hilly terrain about 9 miles east of McFarland. State Highway 65 was located about 0.8 nm west of the accident site. All major structural components of the helicopter were located within the wreckage debris path, which was about 465 ft in length and oriented on a magnetic heading of about 037°. Portions of the main rotor blades, metal fragments, medical equipment, various flight controls, and fuselage components were observed along the debris path.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe first identified point of contact (FIPC) was a ground scar, measuring about 2 inches wide by 7 inches long, which was consistent with a main rotor blade strike. Two additional ground scars, consistent with main rotor blade strikes, were located about 12 and 21 ft beyond the FIPC. Adjacent to the 21-ft ground scar was an impact crater that was about 12 inches deep, between about 29 and 54 inches wide, and 5 ft in length. Within the impact crater, portions of a landing skid, fuselage antenna, and a panel from the bottom side of the fuselage were found.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 77 ft from the FIPC, the left skid was located along slightly down-sloping terrain. The lower portion of the left door was located about 126 ft from the FIPC. The right skid was located about 213 ft from the FIPC, and the inboard portion of the yellow main rotor blade was located about 226 ft from the FIPC. The main wreckage and tailboom were located about 260 and 337 ft, respectively, from the FIPC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuselage came to rest in an upright position, oriented on a magnetic heading of about 330°. The main rotor head remained attached to the mast, and three of the four main rotor blades remained attached to the rotor hub. The forward portion of the fuselage was torn open, crushed, and twisted. The bottom portion of the fuselage was partially displaced and torn open. The tailboom had separated from the fuselage slightly aft of its aft fuselage attach point. The vertical stabilizer had separated from the tailboom and was located adjacent to the fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB examined the recovered wreckage at the facilities of Plain Parts, Pleasant Grove, California. Bell Helicopter, Rolls-Royce, Rogers Helicopters, and the FAA also participated in the examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuselage was mostly fragmented from the bottom of the engine deck structure downward. The forward fuselage exhibited crush damage from the nose to slightly forward of the baggage compartment. The transmission deck and engine pan exhibited significant impact damage and remained attached to the intermediate section of the fuselage. The tailboom was mostly intact. The left-hand finlet on the horizontal stabilizer was fractured, and the right-hand finlet remained attached. The stinger remained attached to the bottom of the vertical stabilizer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward fuel cell, which had about 20 to 24 gallons of fuel that was removed before recovery of the airframe, was ruptured along the top of the fuel cell. The aft (main) fuel cell was ruptured with no fuel noted prior to removal of the wreckage. The fuel transfer and fuel boost pumps were damaged from impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub remained attached to the main rotor mast with the mast nut in place. The yoke displayed fractures near two of the four inner elastomeric shear bearings. The red blade, which had been cut about 12 inches from the hub for wreckage recovery purposes, exhibited fractures outboard of the blade root that spanned about one-third of the blade's length. The green blade also exhibited fractures outboard of the blade root that spanned about one-third of the blade's length. The yellow blade remained attached at the grip with the yoke flexure separated from the main rotor hub. The blue blade remained attached at the grip. All of the main rotor blades exhibited ground impact marks along the leading edges.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nContinuity was established from the collective and cyclic to the main rotor blades and from the pedals to the tail rotor. Numerous separations were observed throughout the flight control system that were consistent with impact damage. The three-control servos were removed for further examination and functional testing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo evidence was found of any foreign object or wildlife strike on the tail rotor, wind screen, main rotor blades, main rotor mast, or pitch change links.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the airframe. The N2 system turned freely from the fourth-stage turbine wheel to the power takeoff gear. The N1 system turned freely, and continuity was established from the compressor impeller to the starter generator pad. Several blades from the impeller were bent opposite their direction of travel. The fourth-stage turbine wheel was intact and appeared normal. The bleed valve was fractured from the compressor scroll. Multiple dents were noted on the compressor scroll, discharge tube, and outer combustion case. Neither the upper nor the lower magnetic chip detectors contained magnetic debris. The airframe fuel filter and fuel removed from the filter bowl were free of debris. The fuel tested negative for water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine control unit (ECU) was found intact and attached to the airframe. The ECU was removed, and stored data were downloaded. The data showed no faults or anomalies before the accident sequence. The ECU recorded less than one line of operational data, including an NR drop below 92%. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Kern County Sheriff's Office, Coroner Section, Bakersfield, California, performed an autopsy on the pilot. The autopsy report indicated that the pilot's cause of death was blunt injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological tests on specimens recovered from the pilot, which were negative for drugs, ethanol, and carbon monoxide.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was further examined at the Rolls-Royce facility in Indianapolis, Indiana under the supervision of the NTSB investigator-in-charge. The lower chip detector exhibited a small sliver of metal. The fuel filter and oil filter were free of debris. N1 and N2 could freely be rotated by hand. N1 exhibited slight interference when rotated due to the displacement of the rubber shroud from the bell mouth inlet into the compressor. All \"B\" nuts were verified to be at least hand tight. The bleed valve housing was found fractured in a manner consistent with impact. Dirt was observed within the bleed valve, which prevented the valve from being manually moved. Most of the compressor blades were bent opposite from their direction of rotation. A significant amount of dirt was located throughout the engine gas path. The compressor rotor showed evidence of contact with the scroll, which exhibited rotational witness marks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRemoval and disassembly of the turbine showed no evidence of any operational failure or malfunction. Ingested dirt was observed throughout the turbine and exhaust. A significant amount of dirt was compressed around the fuel nozzle. The accessory gearbox was intact and unremarkable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nServo Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe servos were examined at Bell Helicopter's facility in Hurst, Texas, on January 24, 2018.  Examination of the three control servos found no pre-accident deficiencies, and each servo passed a functional check.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAvionics Examination and Testing&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Garmin GRS 77H AHRS unit and the GDU 620 display unit were removed from the wreckage and were examined at Garmin's facilities in Olathe, Kansas, and Salem, Oregon, respectively, under the NTSB's supervision.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBefore testing, the GRS 77H unit's assert logs were downloaded. A review of the downloaded logs revealed that one assert entry recorded at 19:03:40, at a location consistent with the accident site. The assert entry indicated that 14.3 minutes after the AHRS was last powered up, the AHRS measured an abrupt and excessive change in the aircraft body roll angular rate. Specifically, within about 0.04 second, the body roll angular rate of the helicopter advanced to a roll rate that exceeded 16 degrees/second, which caused a software-initiated reset of the AHRS. The North, East and Down velocities at the moment the assert was triggered were 53.7, 100.7, and 34.4 knots, respectively. The rate of descent was calculated to be about 3,486 ft per minute at the time of the log entry. The air data computer recorded that the true airspeed at the time was 113.3 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe GRS 77H unit underwent functional and motion tests. Overall, the unit performed unremarkably. For detailed information regarding the testing of the GRS 77H, see the System Group Chairman's Factual Report in the public docket for this investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBefore functional testing of the GDU 620, the recorded assert logs were downloaded, but there were no recorded logs on or about the day of the accident. Functional testing of the GDU 620 was unremarkable. For detailed information regarding the testing of the GDU 620 unit, see the GDU 620 examination reports in the public docket for this investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRogers Helicopters started in 1962 with operations in powerline construction and aerial firefighting. The company began emergency medical services (EMS) operations in 1991. At the time of the accident, Rogers Helicopters was headquartered in Fresno, California, and operated 3 turbine-powered airplanes and 38 turbine-powered helicopters and employed about 55 full- or part-time pilots. For EMS operations, the company operated two Bell 407 helicopters, a Bell 430 helicopter, and a Beech King Air airplane.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor the accident flight, Rogers Helicopters was doing business as SkyLife. Rogers Helicopters' director of operations reported that SkyLife was a partnership with American Ambulance, with American Ambulance providing the medical crewmembers and equipment and Rogers Helicopters providing the pilot and aircraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSkyLife Standard Operations Procedures (SOP) Manual&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to SkyLife's SOP Policy and Procedure Manual, the pilot-in-command \"is the final authority for safe operations and may elect to not begin or continue a flight should safety be compromised. Additionally, if medical personnel do not feel comfortable during any part of the flight it shall be canceled regardless of existing weather conditions.\" The manual referred to the company's weather minimums, which were defined in Rogers Helicopters' FAA-approved operations specifications. The weather minimums were also found in Rogers Helicopters' operations manual. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRogers Helicopters' Operations &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRogers Helicopters' Part 135 Operations Manual outlined weather minimums for nighttime operations for local and cross-country flights. Local flights in VFR conditions required a 500-ft agl ceiling and 2 miles visibility within a 25-nm radius of the company's base. For cross-country operations in VFR conditions, a ceiling of 1,000 ft agl and 3 miles visibility were required for operations outside of a 25-nm radius of the company's base. In addition, the operations manual stated that, \"if during flight, unforeseen or unforecasted weather is encountered that is below operating VFR minimums, the Pilot in Command shall use his/her discretion in whether to abort the flight and return to Rogers Helicopters, Inc. or continue the flight under Instrument Flight Rules with currently qualified personnel and approved aircraft.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRogers Helicopters' Flight and Ground Risk Analysis Program&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs part of its safety management system (SMS), Rogers Helicopters used its Flight and Ground Risk Analysis Program to identify the risks involved for a flight. The company's SMS manual stated, \"Rogers Helicopters will determine an acceptable level of risk for its flights based on the type of operation, environment, aircraft used, crew training, and overall operating experience. When the risk for a flight exceeds the defined acceptable level for Rogers Helicopters, the flight will be further evaluated, and risk decisions made by appropriate Rogers Helicopters leadership.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs part of this program, pilots complete a risk assessment worksheet before a flight to determine whether the flight would be low or high risk. The worksheet included specific factors related to flight operations, and a numeric value was derived depending on the factors that were identified for a flight. A flight had to automatically be declined if the numeric value was 17 or higher.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe risk assessment worksheet completed by the accident pilot noted that the flight would occur at night and would involve a \"scene call\" (dynamic factors). Also, the \"new pilot\" box (static factor) and the \"rested 4+ hours\" box (risk reducing factor) were checked. In addition, the pilot noted that the highest obstacle would be at 1,293 ft, visibility would be 10 miles, and that he was \"healthy, rested and fit for duty.\" The risk assessment worksheet identified a risk factor of 7 for the flight, which was below Rogers Helicopters' \"decline factor.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNVG Training&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording SkyLife's SOP manual, pilots are required to undergo initial and recurrent qualification training to use NVGs. As part of initial training, 7 hours of ground training and 5 hours of flight training were required. The accident pilot had completed 0.78 hours of NVG training. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The private pilot and the pilot-rated passenger departed for a flight in the pilot's newly purchased helicopter. The pilot practiced several landings in a field during the flight and then flew back to the departure airport, where the approach and hover taxi to the ramp were uneventful. The pilot made a landing attempt on a dolly but landed only partially on the dolly, which caused the helicopter to pitch nose up and strike the ground with its tail. The helicopter hit the dolly with such force that the dolly broke free from the chocks securing it and spun around. The helicopter climbed and spun upwards aggressively but stabilized after rotating 270° to the right.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot then landed the helicopter in an abnormal location that straddled the ramp and a taxiway. Ground crew personnel re-secured the dolly with chocks, and, after about 2 1/2 minutes, the pilot again attempted to land on the dolly, this time from the opposite direction. He made two unsuccessful attempts but was unable to maintain a stabilized approach each time. Although the pilot had the option to land on the ramp, he persisted in attempting to land on the dolly. On his third attempt, he again landed partially on the dolly, and the helicopter rocked back and forth striking the ground with its tailskid, before violently climbing and pitching nose down, while rolling right. The helicopter spun 180° to the left and pitched up steeply, and the tail rotor and vertical stabilizer struck the ground and separated. The helicopter hit the ground left side low, bounced, and rotated another 360° before landing hard on its belly. The main rotor blades continued to spin and the engine continued to operate; the helicopter spun on its belly at a rate of about one revolution per second for more than 5 minutes, while gradually sliding about 530 ft along the ramp. The tailboom and horizontal stabilizer then separated, and the helicopter violently rolled onto its side, shed its main rotor blades, and came to rest.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnboard video showed that the pilot became incapacitated during the final ground collision. The passenger remained conscious after the impact and reached for the throttle on the pilot's collective control shortly after the helicopter started to spin, but the throttle position remained unchanged. He then attempted to brace himself against the glare shield, but he eventually became incapacitated after about 2 minutes due to his injuries, the forces imposed by the spinning helicopter, or both. He did not make any attempt to reach up for the engine-start selector or the fuel shutoff lever.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination did not reveal any anomalies with the helicopter's airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the weeks preceding the accident, the pilot had expressed concern to multiple flight instructors that he was having difficulty adjusting to the flight characteristics of the helicopter. In particular, he found dolly-landings challenging.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the pilot had many years of experience flying a Bell 407 helicopter, there were two significant differences between the Bell 407 and the accident helicopter. First, their main rotor systems rotated in opposite directions; therefore, the foot pedal inputs required to counteract changes in torque during takeoff and landing were opposite. (The pilot's difficulty adapting to this difference was evidenced during most of the previous takeoffs captured by the onboard video when the helicopter yawed significantly after lifting off.) Second, the tips of the landing skids, which were used as a visual reference during landing, were forward of the pilot in the Bell 407 but just aft of the pilot in the accident helicopter. This change in visual reference would have been particularly significant during dolly landings, which require landing on a specific point directly below the pilot's field of view.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had received about 11 hours of flight instruction in the helicopter, and, despite the fact that his instructors advised him not to fly without an instructor, he opted to fly with a passenger instead of an instructor on the accident flight. Although the passenger held a helicopter rating, he was not an instructor or professional helicopter pilot and had about 180 hours total in helicopters. Furthermore, it was likely that he had little or no experience in the accident helicopter make and model.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's instructors reported a mobility problem with the pilot's left arm that affected his ability to reach overhead, but this problem likely did not contribute to the accident, because he had no need to reach overhead during landing. Postmortem toxicology testing identified amlodipine, valsartan, and rosuvastatin as well as diphenhydramine at 0.538 ug/ml and alprazolam at less than 0.05 mg/l in the pilot's blood. The pilot had heart disease and hypertension and used amlodipine, valsartan, and rosuvastatin for their treatment; however, these conditions and medications most likely did not contribute to the accident as they do not affect judgment or decision-making. Alprazolam is a significant central nervous system (CNS) depressant with the lower end of the therapeutic range at 0.0060 mg/l. The exact amount of alprazolam in the pilot could not be determined by testing and may have been very low.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe therapeutic range for diphenhydramine is 0.0250 to 0.1120 ug/ml. However, diphenhydramine undergoes postmortem redistribution, and postmortem central blood levels may increase by about three times. When divided by three or four, the pilot's postmortem level suggests that he had therapeutic levels at the time of the crash. Compared to other antihistamines, diphenhydramine causes marked sedation and is also a CNS depressant. In addition, it may cause altered mood and impaired cognitive and psychomotor performance. The use of two CNS depressants simultaneously typically results in cognitive impairment which is magnified well beyond the simple addition of the effects, even when the amount of one of them may be low. Therefore, the pilot's decision-making, judgment, and psychomotor performance were most likely impaired by the combination of CNS depressants, diphenhydramine and alprazolam.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter was manufactured in 2014 and equipped with a Turbomeca Arriel 2D engine. The helicopter had dual collective, cyclic, and foot pedal controls, with primary flight control intended from the right seat.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was maintained under a continuous airworthiness program and had accrued 35.2 hours of total time since new when the accident occurred. The last inspection took place 20.6 flight hours before the accident on August 15, 2015.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter had undergone a series of twenty-three upgrades in May 2015, including the installation of an auxiliary side locker fuel tank, full length skid shoes, a radar altimeter, and a Genesys Aerosystems HeliSAS stability augmentation system and two-axis (pitch and roll) autopilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe HeliSAS system provided attitude stabilization and force feedback to the cyclic control, via electro-mechanical servo actuators connected in parallel to the flight controls. The systems technical overview documentation stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"The HeliSAS system is designed to be engaged at all times: \"SAS\" on before takeoff, and \"SAS\" off after landing. The \"force feel\" (force trim) feature enhances handling characteristics and mitigates inadvertent cyclic control inputs that could result in dangerous attitudes. The pilot may override the HeliSAS at any time with manual cyclic inputs. Only 3.5 lbs of pilot force in the pitch axis, and 3.0 lbs in the roll axis, at the cyclic control is required to override the system for pilot desired maneuvering when either the SAS or autopilot modes are engaged.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was serviced with the addition of 70 gallons of Jet A fuel on the morning of the accident. - The helicopter was equipped with an Appareo Vision 1000 flight data monitor. The unit was capable of recording video, audio, GPS coordinates, and pitch, roll, yaw and acceleration data. The unit was mounted in the aft center ceiling of the cockpit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe unit was sent to the NTSB Vehicle Recorders Division for data extraction, and a video group consisting of the NTSB investigator-in-charge and technical representatives from Turbomeca and Airbus Helicopters was convened to review the data.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe unit had recorded video and audio data, along with GPS coordinates for the entire flight. The field of view included over-the-shoulder video images of the forward cockpit, which included both cyclic controls and the right-seat collective and foot pedal controls, along with most of the instrument panel and a view out the lower forward portion of the windscreen. The unit did not record any radio or microphone audio. Only loud engine and transmission noises could be heard for the duration of the recording.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe video recording began at 1406:52 and depicted the helicopter stationary on the dolly at the east end of the FBO's ramp, with the engine running and the pilot configuring the avionics system. Six minutes later, the helicopter departed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGPS data indicated that for the next 27 minutes the helicopter flew generally to the east and approached an open field at an elevation of about 4,500 ft mean sea level (msl), 4.5 miles south of the peak of Palomar Mountain. The helicopter then performed a left downwind landing approach into the field, lined up on final from the south, and landed at the far end of the field just short of the tree line. Twenty seconds after landing, the pilot turned on the SAS system. The pilot then initiated a hover, and the helicopter lifted off the ground and immediately yawed about 25° to the left, before setting back onto the ground. Thirty seconds later, the pilot began another hovering maneuver, and, after lifting off the ground, the helicopter immediately spun about 150° to the right before setting back onto the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 40 seconds later, at 1443:09, the helicopter lifted off the ground up uneventfully, and departed toward the southeast. For the next hour, the helicopter took a route toward the Salton Sea, then north along the coastline toward La Quinta, where it turned inland and began to track back to Carlsbad. During the period after departing from the field, the pilot turned the SAS system from active to standby mode multiple times and occasionally engaged the autopilot. Helicopter control was handed back and forth between the two pilots as they performed various tasks including activating the auxiliary fuel tank transfer pump, viewing their personal electronic devices, and referencing the helicopter's flight manual.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1610, the helicopter approached the airport from the east, conducted a straight-in approach, and crossed the threshold of runway 24 at 1612:05. The SAS system was in standby mode, and, as the helicopter approached the runway, the passenger lifted his right hand over his face in an apparent effort to shield himself from sun glare. The pilot appeared to be wearing sunglasses. The helicopter flew along the runway and then turned left, crossed the runway 6-24 hold short line, and entered taxiway A3 while in a low hover. The helicopter proceeded along taxiway A, approaching the landing dolly, which, having been relocated, was now at the west end of the FBO's ramp.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter approached the dolly, but, due to sun glare, minimal outside references were visible in the recording. Over the next 30 seconds, the occupants appeared to have been jostled in their seats, the helicopter pitched nose down, and the cockpit instruments registered a right roll of about 25°. The helicopter then yawed to the right and began maneuvering toward taxiway A and the ramp. It landed straddling the ramp and taxiway, and the pilot then entered the ground control frequency in the avionics system. About that time, an incoming call was received on the pilot's phone; he picked up the phone, ignored the call, and put the phone back down again.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter about 2 minutes, the pilot initiated a hover, and, as soon as the helicopter broke ground, it immediately yawed about 30° to the left. The pilot maneuvered the helicopter west along taxiway A and performed a left turn, toward the east, bringing the helicopter in line with the dolly. During the following three landing attempts, the dolly passed in and out of view in the left side of the lower portion of the helicopter's chin bubble. The pilot's cyclic control inputs were pronounced as the dolly came in and out of view. On the second attempt, as the dolly disappeared from view, both occupants appeared to rock forward. The pilot then backed up the helicopter in a low hover, and the dolly came back into view.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWith the dolly still visible, the helicopter again rocked back and forth and slowly descended, while both occupants again rocked forward. The needle displayed on the first limit indicator on the instrument panel dropped rapidly as the pilot quickly lowered the collective control. Comparison of the onboard video with the security camera video indicated that, about this time, the tailskid struck the ground, and the helicopter pitched up and rotated 180° before the tail again struck the ground. During this time, the pilot was still holding the cyclic and collective controls, and his feet were on the foot pedals. Both occupants then moved aggressively back and forth and from side to side, until the helicopter landed hard on its nose, and both occupants violently rocked to the right. The pilot slumped over to the right and remained motionless, and the helicopter began to spin.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the spin progressed, the pilot-rated passenger reached down to the throttle control on the pilot's collective with his right hand. His hand remained on the control for about 3 seconds, but the control did not move out of the \"FLIGHT\" detent position. The passenger then moved his right hand to the glare shield lip where it remained for about the next 2 minutes. The passenger then appeared to loosen his grip on the glare shield, and he remained motionless, while the helicopter continued to spin. Eventually a loud \"bang\" was recorded, and the helicopter stopped violently and came to rest on its right side. Neither occupant moved as first responder personnel arrived and began the process of entering the cabin. - On November 18, 2015, at 1623 Pacific standard time, an Airbus Helicopters AS350B3E, N711BE, departed controlled flight while landing on a dolly at Mc Clellan-Palomar Airport, Carlsbad, California. The private pilot and the pilot-rated passenger were fatally injured; the helicopter sustained substantial damage. The pilot, who was the owner, was operating the helicopter under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The local personal flight departed Carlsbad at 1412. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flight was for the pilot to gain familiarity with the helicopter, which he had recently purchased. The entire accident sequence was captured on a series of airport security cameras and the mobile phone cameras of multiple witnesses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 2 hours before the accident, the helicopter departed from its dolly on the east end of the Premier Jet fixed base operator (FBO) ramp, which was located midfield on the south side of runway 6/24. After departure, line crew moved the dolly to the west end of the ramp.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUpon returning, the helicopter approached the airport from the northeast and was cleared to land on runway 24. It descended to midfield, turned left at taxiway A3, and approached the ramp in a low hover via the parallel taxiway A. The helicopter then began an approach to the dolly from the east, directly toward the sun. The helicopter landed short of, and partially on, the dolly with the center of its skids contacting the dolly's aft edge. The helicopter immediately rocked back, pitching nose up, and its tailskid struck the ground. The helicopter then began a series of fore and aft oscillations, and the dolly broke free from its front left chock, rotated to the right, and pivoted around its rear right wheel. The helicopter spun rapidly with the dolly for the first quarter of the turn and then quickly spiraled upward 270° to the right. The dolly came to rest to the north, having rotated 180°. The pilot repositioned the helicopter and landed it on the ground, straddling the ramp and taxiway A. Just before landing, the pilot was queried by the air traffic control tower controller and responded, \"yeah, they didn't chock my cart, and I was like a skateboard out here,\" The tower controller then requested that the pilot switch to the ground control frequency.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the next 2 1/2 minutes, the line crew re-secured the dolly, installing chocks on three of the four wheels. The pilot then took off and climbed the helicopter to about 20 ft while it yawed to the left, and he repositioned it for an approach to the dolly now from the west. During the next 4 1/2 minutes, the pilot made three landing attempts, getting the helicopter to within about 5 ft vertically of the dolly on the first two attempts. After the first attempt, the pilot repositioned the helicopter by circling back around the dolly. After the second attempt, the pilot performed a hovering climb and backed the helicopter into position. A video of the third and final landing attempt was captured by a witness, who was located about 130 ft to the south. The witness was initially watching the helicopter from his airplane on the ramp, but he was concerned that the helicopter might crash, so he exited the airplane and positioned himself behind a car at the corner of the FBO's hangar.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe video revealed that the helicopter hovered over the dolly for about 60 seconds and then landed short, teetering on the aft edge of the dolly (Image 1). The tailskid almost struck the ground, and the helicopter then rapidly pitched forward (Image 2) and then aft again. The tailskid then struck the ground (Image 3), and the helicopter pitched forward, rolled right (Images 4 and 5), and climbed out of view behind the hangar. Security cameras revealed that the helicopter then spun 180° to the left, and the nose pitched up to a 45° attitude. The tail rotor and vertical stabilizer assembly then struck the ground and separated, and the helicopter hit the ground left side low, bounced, and rotated another 360° before landing hard on its belly. Once on the ground, the main rotor blades continued to spin, while the helicopter started spinning on its belly, as the engine continued to operate (Image 6).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter continued spinning at a rate of about one revolution per second for the next 5 minutes while incrementally sliding about 530 ft east along the ramp. The tailboom and horizontal stabilizer then separated, and the helicopter rolled onto its side, shedding the main rotor blades. The engine continued operating for another 30 seconds while the fire crew doused the helicopter. White smoke billowed from the engine's exhaust after the helicopter came to rest, but there was no fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImage 1 - Helicopter Landing Short of the Dolly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImage 2 - Helicopter Landing Short of the Dolly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImage 3 - Helicopter Tail Striking the Ground&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImage 4 - Helicopter Rolling Right over the Dolly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImage 5 - Helicopter Spinning 180 degrees, with Tail Striking the Ground&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImage 6 - Helicopter Spinning after Ground Collision - Pilot&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of his most recent FAA medical examination, the pilot reported hypertension and the use of medications including nebivolol (blood pressure medication), pantoprazole (heartburn medication), and rosuvastatin (cholesterol lowering medication).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the autopsy performed by the County of San Diego Office of the Medical Examiner, the pilot's cause of death was multiple injuries, and the manner of death was accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe autopsy report noted significant intracranial injuries with bilateral subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage more pronounced on the right side and the base of the brain extending into the foramen magnum and cervical canal. Intraventricular hemorrhage without parenchymal contusions was also noted. In addition, hemorrhage of the anterior cervical ligament associated with fractures of the body of C6 (and possibly C7) with associated subdural hemorrhage surrounding the cervical spinal cord was identified.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's heart was enlarged, and mild coronary artery disease with 50% stenosis was also described.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing by the medical examiner detected amlodipine (0.34 mg/l) and alprazolam (less than 0.05 mg/l) in peripheral blood.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing by the FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, identified amlodipine, valsartan, rosuvastatin, and diphenhydramine (0.538 ug/ml) in heart blood. In addition, the FAA laboratory found alpha-hydroxyalprazolam (0.044 ug/ml) and salicylate in urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAmlodipine and valsartan are blood pressure medications and, along with rosuvastatin, are generally considered non-impairing. Alpha-hydroxyalprazolam is a metabolite of alprazolam, a potentially impairing anxiety medication. Alprazolam is commonly marketed under the name Xanax, and it carries the warning: \"Because of its CNS (central nervous system) depressant effects, patients receiving alprazolam tablets should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations or activities requiring complete mental alertness such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle. For the same reason, patients should be cautioned about the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs during treatment with alprazolam tablets.\" Diphenhydramine is a sedating antihistamine that has been shown to significantly impair performance at routine doses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot-Rated Passenger&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot-rated passenger reported no chronic medical problems and no medications at the time of his most recent FAA medical examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the autopsy performed by the County of San Diego Office of the Medical Examiner, the pilot-rated passenger's cause of death was multiple injuries, and the manner of death was accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHis injuries included bilateral subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhages, ligamentous instability at C1/C2, and fracture at C6/C7 with associated subdural hemorrhage but without obvious spinal cord injury. In the torso, there was a fracture of the sternum along with multiple rib fractures, some associated with retroperitoneal hemorrhage. There were widely open fractures of both bones of the lower left leg. He was found to have an enlarged heart with thickened walls and minimal coronary artery disease.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing by the FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory identified ranitidine (a non-impairing heartburn medication) in the pilot-rated passenger's urine. - According to the U.S. Naval Observatory's Astronomical Applications Department, the altitude of the sun when viewed from Carlsbad at 1620 would have been 4.3°, with an azimuth (E of N) of 243.7°. - The pilot was seated in the front right seat, and the pilot-rated passenger was seated in the front left seat.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and sea, multiengine land, instrument airplane, and rotorcraft-helicopter. He also held a type rating for the Cessna Citation Jet (CE-525S).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a third-class medical certificate issued on January 19, 2015, with the limitation that he must have available glasses for near vision.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo personal flight records were located for the pilot. At the time of his last medical application, he reported a total flight time of 25,000 hours, with 200 hours logged in the last 6 months. The pilot reported the same numbers on three other applications over the 5-year period preceding the accident, and 25,400 hours total time on his application dated January 18, 2011. His helicopter rating was issued in May 2001, at which time he reported on his rating application a total flight time of 14,000 hours in airplanes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had previously owned and flown a Cessna Citation business jet airplane and a Bell 407 helicopter. His 2001 helicopter checkride flight took place in a Bell 206B3. At the time of the accident, he was receiving recurrent training for the Citation, with the most recent flight 2 days before the accident. The pilot purchased the accident helicopter on October 29, 2015, and had flown demonstration and familiarization flights in it since September 20. According to the helicopter's flight logs, those flights totaled about 8.8 hours and were all conducted with a flight instructor present. The pilot then flew the helicopter with another instructor for an additional 2 hours on November 13.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the two instructors who had flown with the pilot for the familiarization flights and the flight instructor who provided training in the Citation, the accident flight was the first time the pilot had flown in an AS350 without an instructor present. All had recommended that the pilot gain further instruction before flying without an instructor, and the pilot had concurred.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe three instructors shared similar insights into the pilot's flying skills, reporting that, while he appeared to have extensive flying experience, he was anxious about the handling characteristics of the AS350 compared to the Bell 407, particularly during landing. The pilot said that he was having difficulty anticipating flight control forces because the helicopter controls felt \"backwards\" due to the opposing rotor direction of the AS350 compared to the Bell 407. Furthermore, he was having trouble landing on the dolly partly because the tips of the skids were just behind his seating location in the AS350, as opposed to the Bell 407, where he could see the skids just forward and below. Both helicopter instructors reported performing multiple dolly and simulated dolly landings with the pilot, stating that, although the pilot was not completely at ease, he was able to ultimately land on the dolly unaided. The pilot told the Citation instructor that, although he had practiced many landings in the helicopter, he still did not feel proficient and thought that the helicopter was very unstable close to the ground, especially when it was close to the dolly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne of the helicopter instructors reported that the pilot wanted to enable the helicopter's stability augmentation system (SAS) for landings because he had been told it would help his landings. The instructor stated that he wanted the pilot to be able to fly the helicopter proficiently without the use of the SAS. However, for demonstration purposes, they did two landings with the SAS enabled. During those attempts, the pilot appeared to be \"fighting\" against the SAS control inputs, with unsatisfactory results, and he did not understand how to use the SAS release button on the cyclic to override the SAS control inputs. Therefore, the pilot and instructor decided to turn the system off.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth helicopter instructors reported that the pilot appeared to have suffered an injury that restricted movement of his left arm. He could use his left arm to operate the flight controls and reach the lower sections of the flight panel, but he could not reach the upper controls, including the engine start selector panel, without the supportive aid of his right arm. One instructor stated that because of the injury, the pilot was unable to climb up onto the helicopter to perform preflight examinations of the rotor head. One helicopter instructor and the Citation instructor stated that the pilot's hands often shook and that it was particularly obvious when he held a pen, although once he grasped the flight controls the shaking stopped.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth helicopter instructors suggested that the pilot take formal factory-approved flight training, and one instructor stated that he had declined to provide any further instruction until the pilot had taken training at the Airbus Helicopters flight school. According to Airbus Helicopters, in early October, the pilot had signed up for a \"B3 Pilot Transition Class\" scheduled for November 2, but 2 days before the class he called to defer the training. No further communication from the pilot was received by Airbus Helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Citation instructor, who had known the pilot for 6 years, reported that the pilot was becoming concerned that age was starting to affect his reaction time when flying. The instructor had observed the pilot's degrading flight performance and had conversations with him about how maintaining proficiency through regular flying could help. He stated that the pilot was no longer fully proficient in the Citation, that his reaction times were becoming slower, and that he would often let the airplane get ahead of him. As such, the instructor recommended that the pilot always fly with him. He stated that the pilot mentioned that he was going to fly the helicopter for practice with a friend on the day of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot confided in all three instructors that, due to the difficulties he was having mastering the AS350, he was most likely going to sell it and buy another Bell 407. All three instructors stated that they had never seen the pilot's logbooks and had, therefore, never made any entries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot-Rated Passenger&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot-rated passenger held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and rotorcraft-helicopter. His first rating was for rotorcraft-helicopter, and it was issued in December 2004 following a checkride in a Bell 206B3. He was issued his airplane single-engine land rating in December 2014, and, at that time, he reported on his rating application a total rotorcraft flight time of 179.6 hours, including 163 solo hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe held a third-class medical certificate issued on May 29, 2014 with no limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo personal flight records for the pilot-rated passenger were located, and his currency or recent flight experience could not be determined. At the times of issuance of his two prior FAA medical examinations in 2008 and 2012, he reported total flight times of 185 and 200 hours respectively, with no flight time in the preceding 6 months on both occasions. - Postaccident examination of the helicopter did not reveal any anomalies with the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation. The throttle was found in the \"FLIGHT\" detent, and the left and right throttle controls could both be moved in concert with each other smoothly between the control detents.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDolly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe primary structure of the dolly was composed of a 14-ft-wide and 12-ft-long red-painted steel frame, with two castering wheels at the front, and two fixed wheels at the rear. A steel, V-shaped hinged tow bar was attached to the front of the dolly. The landing deck surface was about 12 inches off the ground and made of wood planks coated with light-grey non-slip paint. No manufacturer's label or data plate could be found on the dolly. Standard operating procedures dictated that the helicopter approach the dolly from the rear and land with the tow bar at the front of the helicopter, thereby allowing clearance from the towing vehicle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination revealed two indentations on the rear side of the dolly frame spaced 7 ft 3 inches apart or about the width separating the helicopter's left and right landing skids. The indentations contained freshly detached paint chips that exposed shiny uncorroded steel. Crush marks were present on the wood planks adjacent to the indentations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSecurity camera video footage and statements provided by the FBO line crew indicated that, for the first landing approach, the dolly's rear right and front left wheels were chocked. In the video footage, a line crewmember could be seen checking the security of the chocks after initially setting both wheels. For the accident approach, the rear right and both front wheels were chocked. The chocks were standard triangular-shaped rubber aviation chock pairs that were attached to one another with a short length of rope.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe slope of the ramp at the dolly location for the final landing attempts was about 3° down from right to left when viewed from the approach direction. The helicopter's flight manual indicated a maximum sideways landing slope of 8°.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeats&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth front seats were of the energy attenuating type designed to absorb vertical impact loads. The seats were equipped with four-point belt harnesses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe front left seat did not exhibit evidence of vertical displacement (stroking). The left side of the front right seat did not exhibit evidence of stroking; the right side of the seat exhibited a vertical stroke of about 1 inch downward. -",

Such alerting might have cued the pilot to his failure to reset the yaw servo hydraulic switch to its correct position during the preflight hydraulic check, which resulted in a lack of hydraulic boost to the pedal controls, high pedal forces, and a subsequent loss of control after takeoff. Contributing to the accident was the pilot's failure to perform a hover check after liftoff, which would have alerted him to the pedal control anomaly at an altitude that could have allowed him to safely land the helicopter. Contributing to the severity of the injuries was the helicopter's fuel system, which was not crash resistant and facilitated a fuel-fed postcrash fire.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The instructor and student were conducting a night orientation flight. According to a witnesses who worked for the operator, about 15 minutes after the helicopter departed, he heard what sounded like an engine rollback and the helicopter making an autorotation. This was followed by the sound of an increase in engine rpm and the drive belts squealing, culminating with the sound of the helicopter making a loud thud-type noise. Another witness stated that the engine sounded rough and that the helicopter was making a high pitch whining/squealing sound, after which it went silent. A third witness also heard the helicopter making high pitch noise just before the accident. The helicopter was subsequently located in an open field near the departure airport; a postcrash fire erupted, which consumed the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the lower coupling drive shaft showed evidence of severe wear completely around the forward spline that extended beyond the root of the spline teeth. Severe wear of the forward spline teeth could have been caused by a loss of alignment between the engine and the drive shaft or an inflight loss of lubrication in the rubber boot. The rubber boot that retains grease for the forward spline portion of the drive shaft was not recovered and was presumed missing. Loss of grease coverage for the forward spline, either from a rupture of the rubber boot or a loss of the clamp for the rubber boot, could cause sudden inflight wear and overheating of the spline teeth. Severe wear of the forward spline portion of the lower coupling drive shaft most likely led to sudden and complete loss of translational/rotational power between the engine and the transmission. The reason for the severe wear of the forward spline could not be definitively determined due to fire damage and the loss of associated components, which were not located during the investigation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter, N2096W, serial number S1865, was manufactured in 2004. It was powered by a Lycoming HIO-360-D1A reciprocating engine, serial number RL-7497-51A, rated at 190 horsepower.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the engine had accumulated a total time of 3,729.2 hours, 21.9 hours since its most recent inspection, which was performed on June 22, 2015, and 849.8 hours since its last major overhaul.  Additionally, the most recent 100-hour inspection was performed on June 2, 2015, at an airframe total time of 3,757.5 hours. It was also noted that the engine lower coupling drive shaft, part number 269A5559, serial number S345, was installed on this date with a total time of 5,199 hours. - On July 1, 2015, about 2215 Pacific daylight time, a Schweizer 269C helicopter, N2096W, was destroyed by impact forces and a postcrash fire as a result of a hard landing during an emergency autorotation near the Chelaham Airpark (17S), Newberg, Oregon. The certified flight instructor (CFI) and student pilot received fatal injuries. The helicopter was owned by Precision Flight Training Incorporated, of Newberg, and operated by Precision Aviation Training, LLC, also of Newberg. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The local instructional flight was being operated in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, and a flight plan was not filed. The operator reported the flight departed 17S about 2200.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the postaccident investigation, the company's Director of Operations revealed to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC), that the purpose of the instructional flight was for student night orientation. In a statement provided by a mechanic/witness who had worked for the operator for about three years, the witness reported that he observed the helicopter take off about 15 minutes prior to the accident. It then departed to the northwest, and when it was about 500 feet above ground level he heard the engine roll back, followed by the helicopter making an autorotation.  The witness stated the he heard the engine rpm increase and the drive belts squeal, then heard the helicopter make a loud thud. The witness opined that he knew the helicopter was in trouble because of how low it was. Further, he recalled that the engine sounded normal during the flight, including the autorotation, and that the only thing he heard before the crash that raised his concern was the squealing belts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a telephone interview with the NTSB IIC, a second witness reported that at the time of the accident he was in his home with the windows open, and the helicopter passed his residence very, very low. He said the engine sounded rough, somewhat like the sound cards make in bicycle spokes, and that it went by very fast toward the south. He further stated that the helicopter was making a high pitch whining/squealing sound, after which it went silent. He heard it hit, and then called 911. The witness added that he drove to the accident site, which was just a short distance away, and said that the fire started right away, right after it hit the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt a written statement submitted to the NTSB IIC, a third witness, also an employee of the operator, reported that at about the same time as the accident, he heard a high-pitched noise like ungreased belts on a car, followed by a loud sound similar to a backfire. About five minutes later he was advised of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the accident site by the NTSB IIC and a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aviation safety inspector, revealed that while the helicopter was on a left downwind leg for the departure airport, the flight crew experienced an inflight anomaly, which was followed by an emergency descent and a hard landing. The helicopter impacted a harvested wheat field on a magnetic heading of about 173 degrees, and came to rest on a magnetic heading of about 355 degrees, and about .75 nautical miles northwest of the departure airport. The first point of impact was located about 27 feet north of the main wreckage site.  A postcrash fire subsequently erupted, which consumed the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was recovered to a secured location for further examination. - Flight Instructor&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 2, 2015, an autopsy on the flight instructor was performed at the Office of The State Medical Examiner, Clackamas, Oregon. The examination revealed that the cause of death was the result of blunt force chest trauma.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology testing on the flight instructor. The test was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and tested drugs.  Acetone, which was not quantified, was detected in the blood.

Pheniramine, a drug commonly used for hay fever, was detected in the urine but not in the blood. - At 2253, the weather reporting facility at the McMinnville Municipal Airport (MVV), McMinnville, Oregon, which is located about 8.5 nautical miles south-southwest of the accident site, reported wind 260° at 4 knots, visibility 7 miles, sky clear, temperature 22°C, dew point 14°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.94 inches of mercury. - Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe CFI, age 31, possessed a commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument helicopter ratings. He also possessed a flight instructor certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument rotorcraft ratings. The CFI's most recent flight review was successfully accomplished on March 13, 2015, and his most recent second-class airman medical certificate was awarded on August 28, 2014, with the stated limitation, \"Must wear corrective lenses for near and distant vision.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the CFI's personal flight records revealed that he had accumulated a total flight time of 354.6 hours, 278.1 hours in the same make and model as the accident helicopter, and 123.7 hours of flight instruction given. Additionally, the CFI had accumulated 122.5 hours, 66.8 hours, and 3.8 hours in the last 90 days, 30 days, and 24 hours respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe CFI was given a company evaluation flight by the operator on February 9, 2015, and a company Federal Aviation Regulation Part 141 check ride on March 13, 2015. The CFI began performing flight instructor duties for the operator on April 22, 2015.  This was the CFI's initial employment as a flight instructor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot Undergoing Instruction (PUI)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to records provided by the operator, the PUI, age 29, received his student pilot certificate concurrent with his airman third-class airman medical certificate on April 17, 2015, with no limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the PUI's personal flight logbook, he had logged a total of 41.6 hours of flight time, of which 38.4 hours were in helicopters, 6.0 hours was as pilot in commend/solo flight time, and 35.8 hours were in the same make and model as the accident helicopter. Additionally, the PUI had flown 32.0 hours and 19.1 hours in the preceding 90 days and 30 days respectively. - During  the investigation, several of the helicopter's components were retained by the NTSB IIC and subsequently shipped the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, D.C., for examination. The components included the impeller that was attached to the starter ring gear assembly, the drive adapter, the drive shaft assembly, remains of the bump stop, and a grease sample from the engine cooling fan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll parts received were examined at the Safety Board's Materials Laboratory on July 18, 2016, by a Senior NTSB Metallurgist, with a representative from Sikorsky Aircraft in attendance. Sikorsky is the current holder of the type certificate for the Schweizer 269 helicopter. The results of the examination revealed the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImpeller and Starter Ring Gear Assembly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe impeller was attached by twelve bolts and nuts to the starter ring gear assembly.  All the blades on the aluminum fan assembly were fractured at the root portion. The impeller fractured completely around the circumference in the areas near the twelve attachment bolts. Bench binocular microscope examination of the fracture faces on both assemblies contained a rough texture on a slant fracture consistent with overstress separation, with no evidence of a pre-existing crack, such as a fatigue crack.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDrive Adapter&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe drive adapter's surface contained a blue/gray tint, and isolated areas of the adapter contained scale; both conditions are consistent with a steel part that had been exposed to heat. The outer surface contained a dent. The drive adapter contained an inner spline, with several of the spline teeth having exhibited severe inward deformation and gaping cracks in the general area that corresponded to the dent. The spline teeth were intact and showed evidence of minor wear. Fragments of the mating spline teeth were found wedged in between the inner spline teeth.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDrive Shaft Assembly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe drive shaft contained spline teeth on the forward and aft ends. The shaft portion between the forward and aft spline showed evidence of bending deformation. The as-received aft spline was covered with black lubricant (grease), and all of the spline teeth were intact. The rubber boot for the aft spline was partially torn, attached to the drive shaft, and covered with black grease. A sample of the black grease was removed from the aft spline prior to cleaning and retained. No further work was performed on the grease sample. The aft spline teeth completely around the assembly showed evidence of minor wear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward spline was dry, exhibited a light brown oxide film consistent with iron oxide, with no evidence of grease. The rubber boot (a component that is used to retain grease) was not attached to the forward end. The forward spline exhibited severe wear and deformation damage that extended beyond the root of the spline teeth. The forward and aft ends of the forward spline completely around the spline exhibited metal squeeze out (metal flow that extended forward and aft). The root radii between the spline teeth were not visible. A circumferential-radial section was made through the forward spline. Examination of the section revealed that the spline was worn beyond the root of the spline teeth.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the aft spline revealed that all of the teeth were intact. The surfaces of the aft spline teeth exhibited minor wear. A circumferential-radial section was made through the intact aft spline. Examination revealed that the core of the shaft contained a microstructure of tempered martensite, typical for a quench and tempered steel, and the surfaces adjacent to the spline teeth contained a darker band consistent with a carburized surface treatment. According to the representative from Sikorsky, the spline teeth are specified to be carburized to a depth of between 0.02 inch and 0.04 inch. The hardness of the carburized layer is specified to be between 57 HRC and 61 HRC. The carburized layer was to have a minimum hardness of 56 HRC at a depth of 0.002 inch below the surface.  The measured hardness values adjacent to the spline surface were consistent with the hardness values specified for a carburized surface.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe drive shaft is specified to be made from steel per the composition indicated in SAE-AMS 6425.  The polished section from the drive shaft was analyzed with a Thermo Scientific Niton XL3t-980 X-ray fluorescence (XRF) portable alloy analyzer. The alloy analyzer indicated the drive shaft contained 1.31% manganese, 0.383% chromium, 1.85% nickel, 0.449% molybdenum and 0.242% copper, consistent with the elements specified for the drive shaft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe core portion of the plug was missing, but the outer circumferential portion remained intact throughout its circumference. The circumferential portion of the plug was covered with black deposits, and revealed no evidence of a fracture feature.  It exhibited a smooth surface consistent with an aluminum alloy that had fused and re-solidified.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGrease Sample from Engine Cooling Fan&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBench binocular microscope examination of the grease sample revealed the grease contained evidence of solid particles (fragments).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n(Refer to the NTSB Materials Laboratory Factual Report No. 16-060, which is appended to the docket for this investigation.) - The aircraft and engine were examined at the facilities of Nu Venture Air Service, Dallas, Oregon, on August 20, 2015, under the supervision of the NTSB IIC and FAA inspectors. Participants to the examination included representatives from Sikorsky Aircraft and Lycoming Engines. The results of the examinations revealed the following.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPhotos of the site provided by a Portland Flight Standards District Office aviation safety inspector revealed that the helicopter was severely damaged by a postcrash fire. All components appeared to be closely located to the main fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe frame tubing exhibited multiple fractures, kinks and bends. It also showed it had been exposed to the fire, with all paint burned away. Both forward cluster fittings that attach the cross beam were separated from the frame tubing. Other portions of the frame were separated by fractures of the tubing or welds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft mast support strut was intact. The right support strut exhibited minor mid span bending, and the left strut appeared straight. All exhibited thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom was separated from the fuselage, appeared intact with minor damage, with no blade strikes apparent. The forward bulkhead attachment lug was fractured and was consistent with overload separation. There was minor fire damage to the paint on the forward end, and oily soot deposits further aft. The tail gear box adapter remained in the boom with several attach bolt holes deformed. The tail stinger was separated at the adapter. Both tail boom support struts exhibited a compression buckle at mid-span, and separated attach fittings at the center attachment to the tail boom. The horizontal stabilizer forward attach fitting was fractured. The vertical stabilizer was crushed and bent aft with vegetation remaining in the folded sheet metal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing gear and crossbeams were severely damaged. The aft crossbeam was largely intact, separated from the frame, and exhibited significant bending, and was fractured and separated at the right side cluster fitting; additionally, the right outboard end was burned away. All landing gear dampers were separated at one or both ends and several were burned.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left skid was fractured and separated just forward of the forward skid strut. The right skid appears to have been intact but suffered melting and burning. The support struts were separated at the crossbeam attach areas, and several suffered significant fire damage and burning.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe root ends of all three main rotor blades remained attached to the main rotor head; the outer airfoils were cut away to facilitate recovery. Each blade was relatively intact, and exhibited minor impact damage. Two blades exhibited thermal damage, with some of the aluminum airfoil consumed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor head was intact and remained attached to the drive shaft. The swashplate and rotating scissor links were intact. The rotor head turned freely in the mast bearing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth tail rotor blades were intact, with one having remained attached to the hub via the strap pack. The opposite blade had separated thru a fracture at the inboard end of the hub spindle and fractured the strap pack also. Tip damage and some airfoil compression damage was present with the separated blade tip cap gone. The pitch change links were attached, although the separated blade link was badly bent. Both blades exhibited thermal damage to the paint.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor fork and teetering bolt were intact, and the assembly teetered properly. The fork was equipped with the elastomeric bearings. The pitch control unit was intact, rotated freely, slid in and out on the pinion, and was attached to the pitch links. The control bell crank was engaged in the pitch control housing and attached to the tail gear box and the control rod. The inboard rubber boot was consumed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor gear box (TGB) remained attached to the tail boom with elongation of several of the attachment bolt holes. The TRG was rotated and exhibited continuity from the input to the TGB output. The chip detector was not examined.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor drive shaft (TRDS) was separated at the forward end from the main gear box (MGB) pinion drive spline. The retention nut exhibited damage to the flange. MGB drive adapter splines were intact. The forward TRDS splines were intact, and the cup contained grease. The forward end of the TRDS exhibited no torsional buckling with some minor tearing and flattening, and was fractured and separated at the point where it passed through the forward bulkhead. The aft spline joint at the TGB was intact, remained assembled and exhibited continuity through the TGB.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main gearbox (MGB) housing was consumed by fire. The pinion and pinion shaft bearings survived. The ring gear and support structure survived and were engaged on the lower drive splines of the main rotor drive shaft. All gear teeth were intact with no indications of breakage. The lower portion of the mast was consumed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe belt drive assembly was largely gone, having been consumed by the fire. The lower pulley was intact and thermally damaged, with both bearings in proper location, and complete except for seals. The linear actuator was in the fully engaged position. The idler pulley tension cable was separated mid-span. Subsequent to an examination with a magnifying glass, it exhibited clean fresh cut marks which occurred during recovery operations. The upper pulley internal wheel was consumed by fire, while the outer ring remained intact. The over- running clutch in the upper pulley functioned properly, engaged counterclockwise (looking forward), and rotated freely clockwise when mounted on the pinion. The engine coupling shaft (short shaft) was located in the lower pulley, and was separated from the engine. The shaft was removed from the pulley, found to be intact, and appeared to be straight. The aft splined end appeared intact with no obvious damage to the teeth. The rubber grease retention boot was melted. The forward splines exhibited severe damage to the extent that they were not visibly discernable. The rubber boot was not present, although the snap ring and safety wire retention hardware remained on the shaft. The engine mounted spline adapter exhibited an external strike with minor deformation. The rubber grease boot retention clamp was observed in place. The engine mounted adapter splines were present with little damage, although there was a hard metallic deposit in the spline groove covering through about a third of the circumference It was about a quarter of an inch long, positioned about the mid-point longitudinally in the spline. The forward end of the pulley hollow shaft exhibited a deformation from internal contact with the drive shaft, bending the outer wall outboard.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral parts were retained by the NTSB IIC to be sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory, located in Washington, D.C. The engine driveshaft, the engine mounted drive adapter, and a bag of sample grease and debris from the Impeller were retained.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with the optional 60-gallon fuel system, which is made up of an additional fuel tank mounted on the left aft of the cabin wall; plumbing is connected to the standard right side mounted tank. The tanks were breached, and exhibited significant burning. Due to impact forces and thermal damage, the throttle and mixture cables were not able to be examined. No investigation of rotation, timing or compression was possible due to the extensive postcrash thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe majority of the flight control system, which is comprised of aluminum and magnesium, was consumed in the postcrash fire. Control continuity was established for the MR swashplate input control rods to the pitch housings. The input rods ended in melted aluminum at about the same point that the mast was consumed. The steel TR pedal torque tube survived the fire, with the TR pedal arms incurring a varying degree of thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTR control continuity was established from the TR blades through the TGB mounted bell crank and control rod in the tail boom, to the forward bulkhead where the rod was fractured.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe electric cyclic trim system was not located, and was presumed to have been  consumed in the postcrash fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was separated from the airframe and sitting upside down on a tarp for the examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe number 1 and 3 cylinder heads and oil sump were consumed by fire. The rear accessory case was deformed and partially consumed by fire. The engine case was deformed by heat. Both magnetos were partially consumed by fire and deformed. The fuel servo was also consumed by fire. The starter ring gear support center was broken apart. The attached fan blades were separated. The edge of the fan blade disk revealed signs of rotation at impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine to airframe drive coupler shaft splines were found sheared off and ground down on the engine side. The engine drive adapter splines contained the sheared off spline from the shaft, and also had damaged splines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cooling fan disk with the starter ring gear attached was located about 20 feet south of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine crankshaft prop flange was observed cracked in several places.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo evidence was found of a catastrophic in flight engine failure. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n**This report was modified on September 30, 2016. Please refer to the public docket for this accident to view the original report.**&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 01, 2015, about 1000 Pacific daylight time, a Hughes 269C, N9490F, collided with powerlines while flying in a canyon in the vicinity of Asotin, Washington. Following the collision, the helicopter was consumed by fire and destroyed. The pilot was operating the helicopter under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured. The personal local flight originated from the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport, Lewiston, Idaho about 0930. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a flight plan had not been filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot communicated with his father earlier in the morning telling him that he was planning on flying the helicopter around 0930 with the passenger, his cousin. Several people in the area of the accident reported observing a helicopter flying in an adjacent canyon. A fire was reported just before 1000, and during the suppression efforts a firefighter discovered the wreckage. The postimpact fire spread predominately south consuming numerous acres of the canyon terrain and fields. Following the accident, a Clear Water Power Co. employee reported that there had been a temporary disruption of service in the powerline.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 17, held a private pilot certificate issued in December 2014, with a rating for rotorcraft-helicopters. He held a third-class airman medical certificate issued in December 2013, with no limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's personal flight logbook, he had amassed 55.5 hours total time, all of which was in rotorcraft, and all in relatively the same make and model as the accident helicopter. He had accumulated about 22 hours in the capacity of pilot-in-command. Based on the airport identifiers listed in the logbook for flight origin and destination points, the pilot accumulated a majority of his flying hours around the Lewiston area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter, a Hughes 269C, serial number 1030243, was manufactured in 1973. According to maintenance records, the airframe had accumulated a total time in service of about 12,725 hours. The most recent annual inspection was signed by a mechanic, as completed in February 2015. The maintenance records disclosed that the Lycoming HIO-360-D1A engine underwent an annual inspection on the same date at an engine total time of about 435 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA routine aviation weather report (METAR) for the Lewiston-Nez Perce County Airport was issued a few minutes before the accident. It stated:  sky clear; visibility 10 miles; wind calm; temperature 86 degrees Fahrenheit; dew point 50 degrees Fahrenheit; and altimeter 29.98 inHg.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located in a small canyon, Ayres Gulch Canyon, which is about 6 nautical miles in length, and oriented north-south, with the accident site located midway. The canyon was one of a series of canyons.   It was surrounded by wheat fields and a large barn, which was located about 1.7 nm south of the accident site. The elevation at the accident site was about 2,225 feet mean seal level (msl), with the surrounding hills about 2,660 feet msl. The main wreckage, which consisted of the fuselage and engine, came to rest on a flat dirt area on the east wall of the canyon.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPowerlines were located 350 ft south of the wreckage with two 35-foot support structures (wood poles) on either side of the canyon, a distance of 1,452 ft apart. The two 5/16-inch diameter guy wires were oriented east-west and ran horizontally parallel to one another. There were powerlines that additionally ran north-south bordering the west canyon wall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLocated under the powerlines was a portion of the canopy frame, which consisted of the mid-left horizontal portion and the center vertical portion. On the vertical portion of the frame there was a bend which would have been oriented directly where the top of the panel was situated in the cockpit. There were additionally red rub marks found on the frame, consistent with contact of the tail rotor blades. A portion of the mid-right horizontal canopy was located near that area. There  were numerous pieces of shaded (tinted) and clear plexiglass observed around the area. The headset holder, portions of the upper canopy slat, frames of both headsets, and the upper tail boom light-clip were located on the hill in between the wires and the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA detailed wreckage and impact report with accompanying pictures is contained in the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Spokane County Office of the Medical Examiner performed an autopsy on the pilot and passenger. The FAA Toxicology Accident Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological testing; the findings were positive for ethanol (alcohol). The toxicology report additionally noted evidence of putrefaction in the specimens received.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage had sustained significant thermal damage. Examination of the airframe revealed that most of the control push-pull tubes and fuselage structure were consumed by fire, with thermally damaged remnants of the bellcranks, cyclic, collective, and anti torque pedals remaining.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth the right and left skids were separated near midspan. The drag strut signatures, coupled with the forward skid fractures on both sides, is consistent with the helicopter in forward motion at the time of impact. The toes of the skids were oriented to be the first contact, which would result in the skid deforming upward and placing a concentrated load on the forward support strut below the damper. The drag struts were relatively straight with little bending, and primarily exhibited crushing from contacting the frame at the forward end. The bowed deformation and numerous fractures of the main frame steel tubing was consistent with a nose-down vertical attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe stationary scissors link which holds the non-rotating portion of the swashplate was fractured. The blue main rotor blade exhibited a significant amount of arcing spatter on its bottom inboard end surface; the other two blades had minor amounts of arcing splatter. The rotating scissors links were intact and remained attached to the swashplate and the lug portion of the scissors support.  Given orientation of the damage, it is likely that the powerlines made contact with the helicopter in the area of the swashplate with electrical arcing and mechanically contacted and fractured the stationary scissors and non-rotating swashplate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom came to rest in front of the helicopter cabin. The tail rotor assembly was resting in the dirt with the blue main rotor blade's leading edge position near the vertical fin. The tail boom exhibited a fracture just aft of the vertical fin attachment on the left side; there were no main rotor blade strike indications on the boom. There was a red rub mark indent located on the tail, consistent and oriented with the tail rotor blades coming into contact with the boom while in rotation. The vertical fin exhibited signatures of a main rotor blade strike on the right side of the boom, consistent with a blade contacting the right side of the vertical fin after the boom was on the ground, with enough energy to fracture the boom tube at the vertical fin attach area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor blades exhibited arcing marks, as did the horizontal stabilizer. The horizontal stabilizer also exhibited bending of the forward inboard sheet metal and spar. It is likely that the electrical transmission wires contacted the tail rotor blades and stabilizer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter manufacturer, if in level flight, the helicopter is about 18° nose-down (depending on airspeed).  Given this scenario, the manufacturer furth stated, that with the accident conditions (estimating the wires were spaced about 6 feet apart), the angle would orient both the wires on top of each other at cabin impact. Assuming the helicopter was maneuvering at 60 mph, 0.11 seconds would transpire between the contact with the first wire (canopy) and the second wire (slat and mast). Given the damage and rub marks, it is likely that after the second wire impact, the helicopter likely pitched up and yawed to the left (wire impact on right side of mast). There was contact at the horizontal stabilizer where the helicopter likely exited the wires and continued in a right rotation with the nose-low descent. The tail boom was likely partially separated at the wire contact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. A detailed examination report is contained in the public docket for this accident. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The non-instrument-rated pilot was conducting aerial application flights in the helicopter and had completed several work orders at various locations before the accident flight. Two coworkers refilled the fertilizer tank on the helicopter and saw it depart from the loading area. About the time that the helicopter was expected to return, a thick fog came in, and the visibility dropped to about 15 to 20 ft. When the helicopter did not return, one of the coworkers searched for the helicopter and found the accident site. Examination of the wreckage did not reveal evidence of any pre-impact mechanical failures. It is likely that the pilot lost visual contact with the ground due to the fog and subsequently experienced spatial disorientation and lost control of the helicopter. This pilot had a similar accident in the helicopter about 5 years earlier, which suggests that he had a habit of taking risks with the weather.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing of the pilot was positive for hydrocodone, dihydrocodeine, acetaminophen, and hydromorphone. The hydrocodone level in the pilot's peripheral blood was 0.718 ug/ml, which was more than 10 times the usual upper therapeutic limit of 0.05 ug/ml. Hydrocodone and its metabolites do not undergo significant postmortem redistribution. Therefore, the measured levels of hydrocodone most likely represent the pilot's antemortem levels. If the pilot had been a novice user, this level would likely have been toxic and caused severe symptoms. However, with regular opioid use, brain physiology changes, leading to tolerance for both the desired analgesic effects and the sedative effects. As a result, incremental dosing increases are required to achieve the same effects, and long-term, chronic users may need the drug to feel and act \"normally.\" The levels present in the pilot indicate that he was chronically taking high doses of hydrocodone. It is likely that the pilot was impaired by opioids at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n In the high workload situation of piloting a helicopter in low altitude flight, even a small degree of impairment from the pilot's use of a high-dose of opioid would have contributed to the likelihood of an accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The pilot was involved in a helicopter accident on September 3, 2010, where he received serious injuries, and the Bell 47G helicopter was substantially damaged (NTSB accident number WPR10LA446). The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was the pilot's visual flight rules flight into instrument meteorological conditions, which resulted in his spatial disorientation and loss of helicopter control. - The helicopter, a Bell 47G-5, serial number 7971, was manufactured in 1970 and was issued a restricted category airworthiness certificate on May 17, 2012. The helicopter's type certificate data sheet indicated that it seated two and had a maximum gross weight of 2,257 pounds. The helicopter was configured for agriculture and pest control operations. The most recent annual inspection was conducted on February 6, 2015, at a total airframe time of 8,275 hours. - On June 20, 2015, about 0715 Pacific daylight time, a Bell 47G-5 helicopter, N4427F,  impacted a fence and terrain while maneuvering about 5 miles southwest of the Salinas Municipal Airport (SNS), Salinas, California. The commercial pilot was fatally injured, and the helicopter sustained substantial damage. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Gomes Farm Air Service, Inc., under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The local aerial application flight originated from a loading area near the accident site about 0650.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a tachograph card found in the wreckage, the pilot had completed six different work orders at various locations on the morning of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo witnesses, who worked for the operator, refilled the fertilizer tank on the helicopter and saw it depart from the loading area. According to the witnesses, about the time that the helicopter was expected to return, a thick fog came in, and the visibility dropped to about 15 to 20 ft. The witnesses became concerned when the helicopter failed to return for its scheduled rinse load. One of them searched for the helicopter and found the accident site nearby. - The Monterey County Sheriff-Coroner's Office, Salinas, California, performed an autopsy of the pilot. The autopsy report listed blunt force injuries as the cause of death. The autopsy also identified an enlarged heart and significant coronary artery disease with 50-75% stenosis of two coronary arteries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology testing of the pilot and identified 0.718 ug/ml of hydrocodone and 0.098 ug/ml of dihydrocodeine in blood and 224 ug/ml of acetaminophen, 4.61 ug/ml of dihydrocodeine, 36.917 ug/ml of hydrocodone, and 12.99 ug/ml of hydromorphone in urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHydrocodone is a prescription opioid identified as a Schedule II controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Administration. It is most commonly sold in combination with acetaminophen, often with the names Vicodin and Lortab. It carries several warnings, including, \"hydrocodone, like all narcotics, may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery,\" and \"alcohol and other CNS (central nervous system) depressants may produce an additive CNS depression, when taken with this combination product, and should be avoided.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDihydrocodeine and hydromorphone are each opioid analgesics, but they are also metabolites of hydrocodone. Hydrocodone's usual therapeutic levels are between 0.010 and 0.050 ug/ml. Dihydrocodeine's usual therapeutic levels are between 0.050 and 0.150 ug/ml.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had reported no chronic medical conditions and no chronic medication use to the FAA. At the time of the autopsy, a small plastic baggie containing 5 tablets labeled M367 was found in the pilot's pocket. The autopsy report identified these tablets as a combination of 325 mg of acetaminophen and 10 mg of hydrocodone. - At 0653, the SNS weather reporting facility, located about 5 miles east of the accident site, reported wind calm, visibility 7 statute miles, sky condition clear, temperature 12°C, dew point 9°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.92 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0653, the recorded weather at Monterey Regional Airport, Monterey, California, about 9 miles southwest of the accident site, was wind 290° at 3 knots, visibility 1 statute mile, mist, overcast at 200 ft, temperature 12°C, dew point 11°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.93 inches of mercury. - The pilot, age 67, held a commercial pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land and rotorcraft-helicopter ratings. He did not hold an instrument rating. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records indicated that the pilot's most recent third-class airman medical certificate was issued on February 10, 2014, with the limitation that the pilot \"must wear corrective lenses.\" According to the pilot's application for this medical, he had accumulated a total of 17,500 hours of flight time of which 200 hours were within the last 6 months. - An FAA inspector examined and documented the wreckage on-scene. The helicopter came to rest on a road near a lettuce field. An opening was torn in a wired fence that ran parallel to the road about 40 ft northeast of the main wreckage. Powerlines running in an east-west direction about 50 ft south of the accident site were undamaged. During the examination, the inspector did not identify any anomalies or malfunctions with the helicopter. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On May 27, 2015 about 0815 Pacific daylight time, a Hiller UH-12E, N138HA, impacted an onion field during agricultural application operations near Wasco, California. The pilot was fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Slikker Flying Service, Inc., under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 as an agricultural flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the area, and no flight plan was filed. The flight originated from a refueling truck about 0813. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe truck operator reported that the pilot had just finished spraying a small field. The helicopter was filled with fuel and about 30-40 gallons of water to clean out the spray system. The pilot took off and departed the immediate area about 15 ft above the field. The truck operator cleaned the fuel/spray truck and was getting into the truck when he observed a plume of black smoke about ¼ mile away over a field crest. He drove toward the fire and observed the helicopter engulfed in flames. - The 0754, automated weather observation at Bakersfield Kern County Airport (BFL), located about 25 nautical miles southeast of the accident site, included wind from 290° at 3 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, clear skies, temperature 18°C, dew point 8°C, and an altimeter setting of 29.97 inches of mercury. - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter, and a Federal Aviation Administration second-class medical certificate dated February 18, 2015, with no limitations. The pilot's logbook was not recovered. During the pilot's last medical examination, he reported 1,136.2 total hours of flight experience, 277 of which were accrued in the previous 6 months. The pilot was hired by the operator in February 2014. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot initially survived the accident but succumbed to his injuries about one week later. No autopsy or toxicology testing was performed. - The helicopter impacted the onion field in a right-skid-low attitude. The field was disturbed between the first point of impact and the main wreckage. Throughout this area were bearings and portions of the tail boom and windscreen. The helicopter came to rest on its right side. The cabin area was destroyed and sustained heavy thermal damage. The tail boom was fracture-separated about mid-span and was found partially underneath the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's main cabin was mostly consumed by the postcrash fire; however, the majority of the airframe remained intact. The cyclic, collective, and pedals were all found loose within the main wreckage; all exhibited signs of heat distress. The left side of the spray boom was fracture-separated in an aft direction. The tail boom was fracture-separated about mid-span, consistent with main rotor blade contact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nControl continuity from the cabin controls to the main rotor system was established. There was no evidence of binding or restrictions on the intact portions of the control linkages. The control linkages located underneath the seats and behind the cabin firewall exhibited breaks and evidence of heat distress. The observed fracture surfaces that were not consumed by the postcrash fire exhibited signatures consistent with overload. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth main rotor blades remained attached to the main rotor hub. Both blades were deformed opposite the direction of rotation. The tips of both blades were fracture-separated and were not located. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe angled tail rotor drive shaft remained connected to the main transmission tail output flange, but it was separated at the aft end. The shaft and shaft housing were deformed about 90° to the left. Separated, deformed, and heavily fragmented pieces of the tail rotor drive shaft exhibited signatures consistent with overload. The aft portion of the tail rotor drive shaft remained attached to the severed aft tail boom structure and was connected to the tail rotor gearbox; when rotated, the tail rotor blades rotated normally. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor blades remained installed at the tail rotor hub. The first blade exhibited a fracture at its leading edge near the root end of the blade and was deformed in the opposite direction of normal rotation. The second blade exhibited downward, chordwise bending near its inboard end. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main transmission and engine remained mounted to the airframe. The main rotor mast exhibited evidence of contact with the main rotor hub. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe spark plugs were removed from the engine and exhibited normal operating signatures and evidence of sooting. The rocker covers were removed and there was no evidence of heat distress. The dual carburetor was removed from the engine and disassembled. There was no evidence of blockage. The interior of the right carburetor was dry, and the floats exhibited cracks. The interior of the left carburetor was wet with possible corrosion byproducts. Both magnetos were removed from the engine and rotated freely. The fuel tank was ruptured and contained no fuel. The fuel screen did not exhibit evidence of blockage or contamination. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "A helicopter with a pilot, a hoist operator, and a helicopter rescue specialist (rescuer) on board was dispatched to transport an injured person out of an area of rough terrain. Based on the patient's location and the time of the call, a night hoist operation was planned. The helicopter arrived on scene, and the hoist operator lowered the rescuer and equipment from the helicopter. While the rescuer and ground personnel prepared the patient for transport, the pilot and hoist operator looked for a nearby landing zone. Upon hearing radio calls from the rescuer that the patient was ready, the helicopter returned to the patient's location, and the hoist operator lowered the hoist hook. The patient, who was in a Bauman bag, and the rescuer were then lifted from the ground by the hoist. The hoist operator continued to reel in the patient and the rescuer as the helicopter transitioned from a hover to forward flight. When the patient and rescuer were about 10 ft below the helicopter's skids, the rescuer fell about 100 ft to the ground. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ground personnel who helped the rescuer prepare the patient for transport did not report seeing anything unusual. They said that, during the initial part of the lift, the rescuer and patient went into some tree branches, the helicopter maneuvered away from the tree, and then the rescuer and patient were lifted up towards the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the rescuer's equipment did not reveal any failures or malfunctions that would explain the fall. Additionally, examination of the hoist hook and helicopter equipment did not reveal any abnormities. Also, review of video from a camera located on the hoist did not identify any failures in the equipment nor did it show how the rescuer was initially hooked into the hoist. In the absence of any equipment failure, it is likely that the rescuer was not properly fastened to the hoist.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn April 27, 2015, about 2150 central daylight time, a helicopter rescue specialist (rescuer) fell during an external hoist rescue operation.  The rescuer received fatal injuries; the pilot, flight paramedic and patient were not injured. The Eurocopter MBB BK 117 helicopter, N392TC, was not damaged during the accident.  The helicopter was registered to the Travis County Purchasing office and operated by STAR Flight, Austin, Texas, as a public aircraft operation. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed during the local rescue flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSTAR Flight operations was contacted in response to an injured individual located on the greenbelt of Barton Creek.  First responders, consisting of ground units assessed that based on the patient's condition and the difficulty in transporting the patient out difficult/steep terrain, that an air rescue was necessary.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, hoist operator (paramedic), and helicopter rescue specialist, gathered the required equipment and before departure and en route, completed the normal equipment checks.  Shortly after arriving at the patient's location, the rescuer and the medical equipment were hoisted to the ground.  The helicopter's hoist operator later deployed a backboard for the patient.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the time the rescuer was on the ground and was preparing the patient for the hoist operation, the flight crew had chosen a running track, located near a school, for a landing zone.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the rescuer had secured the patient in the Bauman bag, she radioed the helicopter; the helicopter moved into position and extended the hook to her.  After receiving \"ready for extraction\", the hoist operator initiated the lift to the helicopter.  Once the rescuer and patient cleared the trees, the patient and rescuer, began a steady spin. To arrest the spin, the pilot started moving the helicopter forward.  The spin slowed and had essentially stopped as they were hoisted upwards. As they neared the helicopter, the rescuer then fell away from the patient and hoist.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWith the patient slightly below the helicopter, the flight crew continued to the rendezvous location, where the patient would be transferred via ambulance to the hospital.  Once the helicopter arrived at the landing zone, emergency personnel disconnected the patient from the hoist connection. The pilot then landed the helicopter, and the hoist operator retrieved the medical bag that was on the hoist. The pilot and hoist operator then departed to assist in looking for the rescuer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nShortly, afterwards the helicopter landed back at the landing zone.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitness interviews&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that they were dispatched to rescue an injured hiker in the green belt area.  The wind was reported from 350 degrees at 5 knots, but noted that it could be a bit more turbulent in the rescue area; so they would approach the area from the north.  They deployed the rescuer and a little later, a backboard, to the rescuer.  They then looked for a 7 meter [landing zone/rendezvous] location, and then loitered in the green belt area, waiting for the rescuer's call for extraction.  After receiving the radio call from the rescuer, they proceeded to the rescuer's area and conducted the hoist operation.  Upon hearing \"axis clear\" from the hoist operator, he transitioned to forward flight; he added that they were approximately 100-120 feet AGL, with the rescuer and patient  just below the skids when the hoist operator stated the rescuer was gone and had fallen from the hook.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hoist operator reported that they were dispatched for a wilderness rescue. He and the rescuer completed the safety checks of their equipment prior to launch. Once at the rescuer area, he reported they deployed the rescuer from an altitude of 100 feet AGL; during the delivery of rescuer, medical and Bauman bag some incidental contact with tree branches occurred.  Once the rescuer was on the ground, she reported \"hook clear\", and he retracted the hoist.  During the retraction, a small tree branch came back wedged on the hoist bumper.  He removed the branch and discarded it over a vacant area and then inspected the hook and cable, to confirm no damage.   They then lowered a backboard via rope to ground personnel who were with the rescuer.  They then departed to look for a 7 meter location.  When the rescuer said \"ready for pickup\", they elected to do the extraction 50 feet higher, to minimize the effect of rotor wash on the ground personnel.  Upon hearing \"ready for extraction\" on the radio, he brought the hoist cable up.  He added that during the lift, the rescuer and victim made light contract with tree branches.  Once clear of the trees, the rescuer and victim started to spin; he asked the pilot for some forward airspeed, after announcing \"axis clear\", to stop the spin.  He added that it appeared the rescuer's legs were parallel to the victim, and thought it was due to the spinning.  The hoist operator stated that after the helicopter gained forward airspeed, the spin had slowed and almost stopped. He noticed that the rescuer was riding in a position lower than normal. At which time, she fell from the rigging leaving the patient and medical bag still attached to the hoist hook.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral fire department emergency personnel were with the patient, when the STAR Flight helicopter arrived on scene. Emergency personnel reported that the rescuer was inserted below their location and had to climb slightly uphill to the patient.  One of the persons stated that there was plenty of lighting, but didn't recall if people were using headlamps. They had also retrieved the backboard for the rescuer. He added that then the rescuer said she was about to call the helicopter in, he asked what else do you need, and she responded to just get the catch hook.   One of the other individuals got the hook and handed it to her. He added that he didn't see the hookup and she gave the 'thumbs up\" and they took off into the air with no hesitation. The rescuer and patient looked \"okay\". They moved into a small tree and looked like the rescuer was protecting the patient.  He added that they stopped, lowered and moved over, or moved over and lowered at the same time; that it looked controlled or surgical, and then they took off into the sky.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother one of the fire department personnel added, that he asked the rescuer if she needed one of them to safety her gear, and she responded that she was fine.  He added that he didn't see the hookup or signal; the rescuer and victim departed quickly and everything looked like other calls by STAR Flight.  He stated that the patient's left foot went into trees a little bit, and he thought, that might hurt.  They repositioned to get out of the trees, and then disappeared above the tree line. He added the rescuer looked chest level with the patient; he had seen three of these (type rescues) and it didn't look abnormal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother fire department personnel reported that he was holding the HRV for the rescuer. She then took it from him and it looked like she hooked up the Bauman bag and backpack. He didn't see her hookup, but he didn't notice everything that was going on. He saw the \"thumbs up\" and they took off.  He added that when the rescuer and patient went into the tree, he thought he heard someone holler; he was the only one that heard it, but figured it was the patient because every time they moved the patient or something hit her ankle, she'd holler out.  He added that he didn't hear it clear enough to know who or what was hollered.  He added that during the lift off from the ground, the rescuer was hunched over the patient.  When they got into the tree they stopped, he couldn't tell if they were lowered down, but they moved over and they were gone.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother emergency personnel added that the rescuer had the HRV in her possession.  She called the helicopter in and the hook came, which had two spot lights and a big orange boom around it.  One of the other individuals handed her the hook, and she hooked into a bull ring; it happened fast.  The rescuer gave a \"thumbs up\", and then they started lifting her. On the rise up, they got into the tree slightly, looked like they lowered her, backed up a couple feet to clear the tree, and they were gone.  He added they were riding good and it looked like the rescuer was slightly above and over the patient, protecting the patient from the tree, and departed without a hiccup.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditional fire department emergency personnel were located at the landing zone (7 meter location) and positioned around the track so the helicopter would have a clear spot to land.  They reported that the helicopter came in, entered a hover, and lowered the patient to the ground.  Typically, the helicopter crew will disconnect the patient, so initially; they did not approach the helicopter while it was in a hover.  The noise of the helicopter also made radio transmissions difficult to hear.  One of the personnel was able to radio contact with helicopter crew to confirm they wanted one of the firemen to disconnect the patient. The person reported that there was one connection to get the big hoist off; the big bull ring had the medical bag and the Bauman bag on it.  After disconnecting the patient, the helicopter landed nearby. He added that the crew chief asked for the medical bag and stated that they needed to go look for their rescuer.  He added that he asked the patient if she remembered, at what point was the rescuer not with you. He stated that the patient responded that she did not know that the rescuer was with her at any point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA citizen came upon the fallen rescuer and called 911; emergency personnel who responded to the injured hiker were first on scene.  The rescuer's helmet was off; the vest was zipped up, the leg straps on, and the triangle [ Tri-link ] was closed.  In order to provide medical care, an officer opened the triangle, and the EMT opened the vest, and cut the belts and leg straps.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for helicopter; airplane single and multi-engine land, and instrument ratings for airplane and helicopter. He held a first class medical certificate that was issued on November 11, 2014.   The pilot had accumulated 5,512 total flight hours with 5,197 hours in helicopters and 315 in the Eurocopter BK 117.  The pilot had previous Army and Coast Guard experience; and had been employed by STAR Flight since August 2012.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hoist operator (paramedic) had been employed by STAR Flight since March 2010. He was qualified both as a hoist operator and a helicopter rescue specialist (HRS).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rescuer (flight nurse) was qualified both as a hoist operator and helicopter rescue specialist. She also held a registered nurse license and paramedic certificates.  She had been employed by STAR Flight since October 2008.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSTAR Flight staffs one helicopter at the University Medical Center at Brackenridge, 24 hours per day and one helicopter at STAR Flight's facilities or at Dell Children's Medical Center, 12 hours per day. Both of these base locations have facilities for crew rest. Crews are normally scheduled for 3, 12 hour shifts (1st shift 0700-1900, 2nd shift 1000-2200, 3rd shift 1900-0700) followed by 3 to 4 consecutive days off the flight schedule. The rotating schedule is to distribute days, nights, and weekends across the crews.  The pilot, flight nurse, and flight paramedic are assigned as a crew and generally work the same schedule. The rescuer was on the third night (1900-0700) of her scheduled work shift.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSTAR Flight reported that they comply with Federal Aviation Administration pilot duty day and rest requirements for flight nurses and flight paramedics.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT/EQUIPMENT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAircraft Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe MBB BK117 is a twin-engine, medium utility transport helicopter. It is powered by powered by two Turbomeca Arriel 1E2 engines.  The helicopter was modified for STAR Flight operations by Metro Aviation, Inc. Shreveport, Louisiana. The helicopter was equipped with a Goodrich external mount, hoist system. The hoist is fitted with a D-LOK rescue hook, manufactured by Lifesavings Systems Corporation. The D-LOK rescue hoist hook is designed to eliminate problems such as inadvertent engagement and self-release (ring roll-out).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a North Flight Data Systems Outerlink cockpit video and voice recorder system. In addition, the helicopter was equipped with an Avalex AVR-8240 DVR recorder mounted on the hoist system that records operations and communications.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA post-accident examination of the hoist and helicopter by the operator, NTSB, FAA, and a technical representative from Airbus Helicopters, Inc., did not reveal any abnormalities that contributed to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n[Equipment descriptions are noted below; photos of select equipment are included in the docket for this case]&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEquipment Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe crew wears a flight suit. During hoist operations the rescuer and hoist operator will wear a Tac-Air Rappel vest, with pockets on the front of the vest.  One of the vest pockets will contain a mobile radio for communications with the hoist operator and/or the helicopter pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe vest is a variant of the TAC-AIR survival vest with two hoisting positions located on the chest (insertion-extraction loops) and one mid-scapular back. The vest is adjustable with removable leg straps. The rappelling hardware can be stored in a pocket until needed. Once attached with two cobra buckles, the repelling hardware is exposed by a two-way zipper allowing access, but not complete separation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSTAR Flight's radio for the vest is a Motorola APX 7000 multi-band (UHF/800) and is used to communicate with aircraft and ground personnel. In conjunction with the radio, a remote, push-to-talk switch allows the rescuer to communicate to the aircraft or ground personnel through their flight helmet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Bauman bag provides a single-point suspension for lifting a patient during a hoist or short-haul evacuation.  The bag can be used with backboards or litters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTri-link (10 mm Maillon Rapide Delta Link- Aluminum) Quick Links, also commonly known as screw links, are used where carabineers are not recommended. The tri-link has a delta shape.  They are used on the vest's insertion-extraction loops, and is the attachment point for the HRV's carabineer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe HRV (Helicopter-Rescuer-Victim) manufactured by the California Mountain Company, consists of a steel O-ring, a blue and red webbing attachment points. Each webbing attachment point, has a 1/2\" Modified D Red NFPA Captive Eye Carabineer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a rescue, the steel O-Ring is the attachment point to the hoist hook.   The blue webbing and carabineer are utilized for patient and/or equipment connection.  The red webbing and carabineer are utilized for the rescuer's connection point.  The carabineer is connected to the rescuer's Tri-Link, which is connected to the TAC Air Vest Insertion-Extraction Loops.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rescuer, Bauman and medical bag connections are all made prior to calling the helicopter in for the extraction. As result, when the helicopter deploys the hoist hook, only one connection is required; the HRV's steel O-ring to the hoist hook.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helmet the rescue crews wear is a Gentex Corporation HGU-56, equipped with headphones, one clear and one tinted visor, and a detachable maxillofacial shield. The helmet also has provisions to attach night vision goggles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring night operations STAR Flight crew members utilize NVG's (night vision goggles). ITT Model F4949F, AN/AVS-9 Aviator Night Vision Goggles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEquipment is either supplied as personalized; issued to the individual, or available at each aircraft base as corporate crew equipment.  The HRV and Bauman bag are not personalized equipment and is part of the aircraft configuration when dispatched on rescues.  Personalized equipment issued depends on the individual's crew position; however, for the rescuer and hoist operator, this typically includes the flight helmet, Tac-Air vest, and equipment such as the Tri-Link.  Personalized equipment is inspected by the member and is replaced \"on condition\". Common equipment is inspected before/after each use, by a member of the crew, and then annually by the equipment custodian, and is replaced \"on condition\" or per manufacturer's guidelines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2151, the Camp Mabry/Austin automated weather observation facility located about 6 miles northeast from the accident site recorded; wind from 360 degrees at 4 knots, 10 miles visibility, a clear sky, temperature 73 degrees Fahrenheit (F), dew point 54 F, and a barometric pressure of 29.78 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2153, the automated weather observation facility located at the Austin-Bergstrom International (KAUS) airport about 8 miles southeast from the accident site recorded; wind calm, 10 miles visibility, scattered clouds at 9500 feet, temperature 66 degrees Fahrenheit (F), dew point 62 F, and a barometric pressure of 29.77 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the United States Naval Observatory, Astronomical Applications Department Sun and Moon Data, the sunset was recorded at 2006 and the end of civil twilight was 2031. The Moon rose at 1441, and set at 0306 on the following day. The moon was waxing gibbous with 66% of the moon's visible disk.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight and rescue operations were conducted in night conditions; each STAR Flight crew member is equipped with NVG's and was wearing them on the accident flight. However, the rescuer is not hoisted while wearing NVG's.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSCENE INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBarton Creek Greenbelt in Austin, Texas is a recreational area with about with 809 acres.  The Barton Creek Greenbelt consists of three areas: the Lower Greenbelt, the Upper Greenbelt and the Barton Creek Wilderness Park.  The area provides sheer cliff walls, dense vegetation, swimming, hiking, and climbing areas.  There are several access points around Austin for the recreational area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Travis County Office of the Medical Examiner, Austin, Texas conducted an autopsy on the rescuer. The cause of death was determined to be, \"blunt force injuries\".&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, conducted toxicological testing on the rescuer.  The specimens were negative for tested drugs and alcohol.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEST AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the rescuer's Tac-Air vest was conducted; the vest's insertion/extraction loops displayed no evidence of failure or suspicious marks.  Belt buckles and leg straps also were absent any evidence that might have contributed to the rescuer's fall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe HRV and Tri-link were also examined. An on-site visual inspection found no evidence of a malfunction.  An examination at the NTSB laboratory under a high power microscope, also found no evidence of witness marks or abnormalities that would indicate a failure of the units.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hoist and cockpit video data cards were shipped to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Vehicle Recorder Laboratory in Washington, DC, for review.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA video group that consisted of representatives from the NTSB, Federal Aviation Administration, Airbus Helicopters, and the operator was formed.  The group was convened at the NTSB Recorders Laboratory, Washington, DC, to view and document the video from the hoist camera.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n(The group chairman's factual report, including transcript, is located in public docket for this accident)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on the details of the accident, the video/recorder review board only viewed a portion of the helicopter's cockpit video for the relevant safety checks and the accident sequence.  It was determined that the video did not contain information relevant to the accident.   (The video report is located in public docket for this accident).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nORGANIZATIONAL AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSTAR Flight (Shock Trauma Air Rescue) is a public safety, government based air rescue program provided by Travis County. Based in Austin, Texas, the program is funded by and reports to the Travis County Commissioners Court through the County Manager over Emergency Services. The program operates under 14 CFR Part 135 and in public aircraft operations depending on the mission.  The program provides transport and emergency assistance from scenes, inter-facility transfers with and without specialty teams, firefighting, search and rescue, and law enforcement support. Normal service area includes nineteen central Texas counties; however, STAR Flight is regularly requested to provide service outside the normal area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe STAR Flight Public Mission Committee (PMC) is responsible for developing, reviewing, and suggesting policies, procedures and protocols related to STAR Flight public missions, and the Aircrew Standards Manual (ASM). The committee consists of the following at a minimum:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n•\tChief Medical Supervisor&#x0D;\n•\tDirector of Operations or Chief Pilot&#x0D;\n•\tTwo Line Crew Chiefs/Hoist Operators&#x0D;\n•\tTwo Line Helicopter Rescue Specialists&#x0D;\n•\tTwo Line Pilots&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe committee uses the  cockpit and hoist recording systems and a formalized Public Mission Debrief / AAR form (completed by the crew) to evaluate all public mission events (training and response) compliance with established standards, individual and crew feedback, and areas of improvement that include standardization, training or equipment changes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe committee is to meet monthly or as required.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe committee did not review the video recording for this accident. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot of the helicopter positioning flight delayed the takeoff for inclement weather to pass. However, about 1/2 hour after taking off, the helicopter encountered rain, fog, and low-visibility, gray-lighting conditions. The helicopter approached a 1-mile wide river, landed briefly onshore, then took off again and began a low-altitude crossing while paralleling a bridge. The helicopter was observed at an estimated 25 feet above the river before it began descending at a 10- to 15-degree angle into the water about mid-way through the crossing. It impacted the water nose-low, left side down, at a sufficient speed for the witness to see the tail \"kick over\" the main rotor blades and snap off. There were no onboard recording devices to confirm what occurred. No preexisting anomalies were found with the helicopter, and no medical issues were identified that would have affected the pilot's performance. The reason that the pilot landed before crossing the river could not be determined. Although the pilot's attention could have been momentarily diverted, it was more likely that the rainy, gray, reduced-visibility conditions resulted in low altitude spatial disorientation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Because the helicopter was not initially located, NTSB did not immediately respond. The helicopter was located on April 7, 2015, and the NTSB Investigator in Charge arrived early on April 8, 2015. Initial witness information was obtained by Haverfield Aviation personnel on April 7, 2015, with follow-up information obtained as needed by NTSB. In addition, FAA Flight Standards District Office inspectors from Birmingham, Alabama, would have normally responded to the accident, but due to office-wide training, inspectors from the Nashville, Tennessee, office responded. - The helicopter was powered by a Rolls Royce 250-C20B engine, driving a rotor head with five metal rotor blades. The airframe had accumulated 9,813 hours of operation, and the engine had accumulated 13,181 hours of operation. There were no recording devices onboard the helicopter. Flight instrumentation was limited to an airspeed indicator, an attitude indicator, an altimeter, and a vertical speed indicator. - On April 6, 2015, about 1300 central daylight time, a Hughes 369D, N555JC, operated by Haverfield Aviation, Inc., was substantially damaged when it impacted the Tennessee River adjacent to the Natchez Trace Bridge, near Cherokee, Alabama. The commercial pilot was fatally injured. Low ceilings and fog prevailed. A company flight plan was filed for the flight, which originated at Roscoe Turner Airport (CRX), Corinth, Mississippi, about 1230, destined for Scottsboro Municipal Airport-Word Field (4A6), Scottsboro, Alabama. The positioning flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a witness, a former private pilot, he heard the helicopter land in a National Park Service field contiguous to his property, on the north side of the river, about 3,900 feet from the 1-mile-long, north-south Natchez Trace Parkway Bridge. He couldn't see the bridge at the time due to fog and light mist.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter remained on the ground for about 45 seconds, still powered with rotors turning; then power increased and it took off smoothly, clearing trees by about 30 feet. The helicopter subsequently headed toward the bridge, and after about 10 to 15 seconds, the witness lost sight of it in the fog. As the helicopter flew, the witness heard no anomalies, and the engine sounded \"healthy.\" He subsequently heard the helicopter hit the water with no change in sound until impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to another witness, he was fishing under the south end of the bridge when the accident occurred. The weather was foggy with low visibility and rain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe witness heard the helicopter for about 10 to 15 minutes before eventually seeing it crossing the river, then saw it coming toward him, paralleling the west side of the bridge. When he first saw the helicopter through the fog, it was level with the top of the bridge. It began a gradual descent, then about 10 seconds before water impact, dropped to about 25 feet above the water. It subsequently descended at a 10- to 15-degree angle (and from a partial reenactment, described as a \"gradual flight in\"), and impacted the water near the center of the river, about 50 to 100 feet east of a green buoy (about 100 yards west of the bridge.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no change in sound before the helicopter hit the water, with the same \"whining\" noise until impact. At impact, the witness saw the helicopter's tail \"kick over\" the top of the main rotor blades and snap off. The helicopter did not hit the bridge. - The pilot's body was recovered on April 14, 2015, about 7 miles downriver from the accident site. The next day, an autopsy was performed at the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, Huntsville, Alabama, where cause of death was determined to be \"blunt force injuries and drowning,\" and manner of death was determined to be \"accident.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing was subsequently performed at the FAA's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, where pseudoephedrine was found in a liver sample and urine, and ephedrine was found in urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the National Institute of Health website, pseudoephedrine is an over-the-counter decongestant, and ephedrine is its metabolic byproduct.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEthanol, butanol and propanol were also found in various samples, consistent with postmortem production from the body's extended time in the water. - Weather, recorded at Northwest Alabama Regional Airport (MSL), Muscle Shoals Alabama, about 20 miles to the southeast, at 1318, included calm winds, 1 statute mile visibility, heavy rain, fog, and an overcast cloud layer at 800 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPhotographs taken from under the southern end of the bridge, just before the accident, revealed medium gray skies, and in the distance (from the shoreline where the helicopter came), a darker gray band of trees and terrain partially shrouded in fog. The water was a darker gray interspersed with bands of lighter gray.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's mechanic noted that the pilot and he had waited at their hotel until bad weather had passed, and once that occurred, pilot then launched to pass behind it. - The pilot, age 54, held a commercial pilot certificate with helicopter rating. He also held an instrument-helicopter rating. According to a report submitted by the operator, the pilot had accumulated 6,884 hours of flight time, all in rotorcraft, 2,079 hours in make and model, and 52 hours in the previous 30 days. The pilot's latest FAA second class medical certificate was obtained on February 1, 2015.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanic reported to company personnel that he had picked up the pilot at Memphis International Airport, Memphis, Tennessee, the night before and they had dinner together. They also had breakfast the morning of the accident, and that the pilot's \"demeanor was great.\" They spoke about the pilot's health and he said he just completed a flight physical and his cholesterol was low; \"he felt great.\" - The helicopter was recovered from the river on April 9, 2015. It was missing the aft part of the tail boom, including the tail rotor and gear box, from about 33 inches (fuselage station 230) aft of the tail boom mount, and only remnants of one main rotor blade were subsequently recovered; the other blades remained missing. The left skid was also missing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDamage began at the helicopter's front, lower left side, and extended upwards. There was no hydraulic crushing (water impact damage) to the bottom of the fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nControl continuity was confirmed from the cockpit to the rotor head, both vertically through the collective, and laterally and longitudinally through the cyclic. Yaw control through the rudder pedals was confirmed from the cockpit to the remnants of the \"long tail rotor control rod\" in the severed tail boom.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotor system drive continuity was confirmed from the engine to the transmission, the transmission to the rotor hub, and from the transmission aft to where the tail rotor drive shaft was severed along with the tail boom.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree of the five rotor blades were fractured just outboard of the doubler at the main rotor root fitting, and two blades were fractured through the strap assemblies and blade pitch housings, consistent with full power on the rotor system at water impact. Extensive damage was also found on the hub upper shoe in the vicinity of all five pitch change housings, consistent with a medium-to-high collective setting at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe longitudinal and lateral trim actuator assemblies were subsequently removed and the ram positions were measured with both indicating mid-travel positions. The actuator motors were also tested, with one initially being able to run full travel, but subsequently failing to run, and, the other, which had an indent mark on it, not being able to run. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The purpose of the flight was to assist in the scheduled burn of an 800-acre wooded area. The helicopter was under contract with the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service. A Forest Service employee reported that, as the helicopter neared the conclusion of a 61-minute controlled burn mission, he observed it complete a turn to a northerly heading at the southwestern end of the burn area. About 7 seconds later, he heard a sound that resembled an air hose being unplugged from a pressurized air tank. A crewmember, who was the sole survivor, reported that the helicopter was about 20 ft above the tree canopy when the pilot announced that the helicopter had lost power. The helicopter then descended into a group of 80-ft-tall trees in a nose-high attitude and impacted terrain. Witnesses participating in the controlled burn at the time of the accident did not observe any other anomalies with the helicopter before the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel system, fuel pump, and fuel control unit were destroyed by fire, which precluded a complete examination. During the engine examination, light rotational scoring was found in the turbine assembly, consistent with light rotation at impact; however, neither the turbine rotation speed nor the amount of engine power at the time of the accident could be determined. The rotor blade damage and drive shaft rotation signatures indicated that the rotor blades were not under power at the time of the accident. An examination of the helicopter's air tubes revealed that they were impact-damaged; however, they appeared to be secure and properly seated at their fore and aft ends.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the morning of the accident flight, the helicopter departed on a reconnaissance flight with 600 lbs of JP-5 fuel. The helicopter returned with sufficient fuel for about 133 minutes of flight, and the helicopter was subsequently serviced with an unknown quantity of uncontaminated fuel for the subsequent 60-minute accident flight. Based on the density altitude, temperature, and airplane total weight at the time of the accident, the helicopter was operating within the airplane flight manual's performance limitations. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMost of the cockpit control assemblies were consumed by fire except for the throttle, which was found in the \"idle\" position. Given the crewmember's report that, after the engine failure, the helicopter entered and maintained a nose-high attitude until it impacted trees and then the ground, it is likely that the pilot initiated an autorotation in accordance with the Pilot's Operating Handbook engine failure and autorotation procedures. A review of the pilot's records revealed that he passed the autorotation emergency procedure portion of his most recent Federal Aviation Administration Part 135 examination, which occurred 1 month before the accident, and this may have aided in his recognition of the engine failure and decision to initiate an emergency descent. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough a weather study indicated that smoke and particulates were present in the area before, during, and after the accident, witnesses reported an absence of smoke near the area where the helicopter lost power and impacted the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "72-hour History&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollow-up interviews with both the pilot's wife and the pilot's roommate were used to construct a 72-hour history. After 7 days of crew rest, the pilot was requested to return to work Sunday, March 29, 2015 as a relief pilot. According to the pilot's wife, he slept normally Thursday and Friday night. On Saturday morning he attended a church conference and then completed a 12 hour drive to Mississippi to prepare for work. The roommate stated that the pilot normally slept \"quite a bit.\" He observed no abnormalities with the pilot's behavior or sleep patterns during the two nights that preceded the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPart 137 Operations Specifications&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to T&amp;M Aviation's Operations Specifications, the accident helicopter was authorized to conduct Title 14 CFR Part 137. The operations specifications also required the holder to maintain the engine in accordance with the Rolls-Royce 250-C230P operations and maintenance manual and had a Time-in-Service (overhaul) interval of 2000 hours for the turbine assembly. The Time-in-Service intervals for the compressor and gearbox assemblies were noted as \"On Condition.\"  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUSDA Forest Service Contract&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn January 10, 2012, the USDA Forest Service entered into a contract with T&amp;M Aviation, to provide an aircraft and pilot for the purpose of performing aerial ignition operations. The contract listed numerous requirements and specified the configuration of the aircraft, the installation of required equipment, and the qualifications and duties of the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAerial Ignition Operation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs part of the contract, T&amp;M Aviation provided a pilot and helicopter during plastic sphere dispensed ignition, a common practice in controlled burn operations to ignite ground fuels on large acreage without damaging the tree canopy. According to the PSD manual, the dispenser case is constructed of aluminum and houses a supply of plastic spheres that each contain 3.0 grams of potassium permanganate. The PSD injects a predetermined dosage of ethylene glycol (common automotive coolant) from an inclusive tank and are ejected from the helicopter in batches of 2 or 4. The injection creates a timed combustion to detonate the spheres outside the helicopter. In the event of a malfunction, the unit is equipped with a 1 gallon water reservoir to extinguish burning spheres that remain within the chamber.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring aerial ignition operations, the plastic sphere dispenser operator (PLDO) is accompanied by a firing boss who directs the mission. The PLDO is a Forest Service-employed helicopter crewmember responsible for the preparation, installation, operation and maintenance of the PSD. Two sections of the device were recovered from the accident site including the PSD exit chute and a small water tank used in the event of a premature ignition. The unit was bench tested by the plastic sphere dispenser operator (PLDO) prior to the accident flight in accordance with the manufacturer's test procedure and a one-gallon container of water was placed in the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Forest Service allows its contract pilots to operate below 500 feet AGL as higher altitudes provide less control of sphere placement, which may result in unintended ignition outside of burn boundaries. The airspeed/altitude combination depends on how the PSD firing boss decides to deploy the spheres, which precludes the use of a prescribed flight profile.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot's Operating Handbook (POH)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the \"Engine Failure and Autorotation\" section of the pilot's operating handbook,&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"At low altitude, close throttle and flare to lose excessive airspeed. Apply collective pitch as flare effect decreases to further reduce forward speed and cushion landing. It is recommended that level touchdown be made prior to passing through 70% rotor RPM…\" - According to FAA records, the accident helicopter was manufactured in 1980, at which time it was equipped with an Allison 250-C28 500 hp turbo-shaft engine. In 1993, an Allison 250-C30P 650 hp turbo-shaft engine was installed in accordance with Petroleum Helicopters, Inc. supplemental type certificate (STC) SH5695SW and modified in 2001 in accordance with Air Services International STC SH296NM. At the time of the accident, the helicopter had accrued approximately 11,602 flight hours. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA maintenance history of the helicopter was established through the operator's archived records, as the most recent maintenance records were destroyed by fire. The helicopter's most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on March 11, 2015, at which time it had accumulated 11,597 hours total time in service. Life limited component inspection schedules were listed for the gearbox, compressor and turbine, which had accrued 11,487 hours, 1,974 hours, and 1,861 hours since their most recent overhauls, respectively.  A review of the component maintenance tracking history revealed that each life or time limited engine component were within their respective life expectancies. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA scheduled inspection of the accident helicopter was completed on November 20, 2014, as part of the operator's contractual agreement with the Forest Service, which did not reveal any discrepancies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's most recent turbine engine power check was completed on February 28, 2015, at 5,742 flight hours. A trend value of +19 was recorded under the following atmospheric conditions: 2 degrees C and a pressure altitude of 10,000 feet, which did not exceed the helicopter's operating limitations when compared to the pilot's operating handbook (POH).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot completed a load calculation form, provided by the Forest Service, for a reconnaissance flight that took place on the morning of the accident flight. According to a USDA Forest Service representative, a new form must be completed each day or if there are changes to the flight crew, the pressure altitude changes by at least 1,000 feet, or the ambient temperature changes by a minimum of 5 degrees C. The pilot first calculates the mission operating weight, the combined sum of the aircraft empty weight, the pilot's weight, and total weight of the fuel. This number is then subtracted from the helicopter gross weight to determine the mission payload weight. A pressure altitude of 300 feet and an outside air temperature of 23 degreee C were included on the form that was completed the day of the accident. The form showed a total combined weight of 3,952 lbs, 198 lbs below the helicopter's published gross weight and 118 lbs below the USDA Forest Service's artificially reduced gross weight. The pilot used the same form to calculate an additional payload to plan for an unscheduled long line fire-fighting mission; however, a representative of the USDA Forest Service reported that the bucket and line were not used on the day of the accident flight.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the helicopter had burned approximately 196 lbs of fuel. The density altitude at the time of the accident was 1,489 feet, which was used in conjunction with a temperature of 27 degrees C and a revised total weight of 3,756 lbs. to compute the helicopter's performance at the time of the accident. A review of the helicopter flight manual indicates the helicopter was operating within \"AREA A\" of the out of the ground effect performance chart.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nT&amp;M Aviation uses a portable fuel truck to supply helicopters based at M24 with JP-5 aviation fuel. As part of their refueling procedure, a record of the fuel sample, quantity, and amount dispensed is maintained by the fuel technician. T&amp;M Aviation was not able to provide a copy of the fuel record on the date of the accident flight; however, according to a load calculation, the helicopter was serviced with approximately 600 lbs of fuel in advance of the helicopter's morning flight.  Fuel performance calculations indicate the helicopter landed at 1050 with approximately 133 minutes of fuel remaining and the surviving crew member reported that the helicopter was subsequently refueled before departing on the accident flight. A fuel sample taken from the fuel tank after the accident was clear and free of any water or contaminants. - On March 30, 2015, about 1436 central daylight time, a Bell 206 L-1, N50KH, registered to HLW Aviation, LLC and operated by T &amp; M Aviation, Inc. under contract to the United States Forest Service, was destroyed by controlled burn fire after it impacted terrain near Saucier, Mississippi. The commercial pilot and the front left seat crew member were fatally injured; the rear seat crew member sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the aerial application flight that was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137. The flight departed Dean Griffin Memorial Airport (M24), Wiggins, Mississippi, about 1334.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter a pre-mission briefing at M24, the flight departed to assist in the scheduled burn of an 800 acre wooded area through a process known as \"aerial ignition.\" A witness that observed the helicopter prior to the accident was walking a road on the southern end of the burn area when he noticed the helicopter \"make a turn and go back.\" About 7 seconds after the turn, the witness heard a sound that resembled an air hose being unplugged from a high pressure air tank, and heard the helicopter impact terrain about three seconds later. With the exception of the high pressure sound, the witness did not observe anything unusual with the helicopter. According to the witness, the helicopter's last transmission to ground personnel was approximately 7 minutes prior to the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral Forest Service personnel were performing controlled burn functions on the ground during the mission. About 6 employees were located near the northeastern tip of the planned burn area, 1 employee was located at the western end, and 3 employees were stationed at the southeastern end, where the helicopter came to rest. Multiple witnesses on the ground, were in contact with the accident helicopter during the operation; however, none of the witnesses observed the helicopter crash nor did they hear a distress call prior to the accident. Several witnesses observed small plumes of smoke scattered across the burn area blowing east as a result of the western wind. One witness reported that a helicopter crewmember inquired about the smoke levels during the mission and made a decision to continue after he determined the smoke levels would not pose a hazard to the flight. None of the witnesses observed the helicopter come into contact with smoke. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSatellite tracking data provided by the online government contracted application Automated Flight Following (AFF), and monitored by a Forest Service dispatch office through a unit mounted in the helicopter, indicated that the helicopter had been operating at a low altitude over the controlled burn area for approximately 56 minutes prior to the accident. According to the data, the helicopter had been flying a grid pattern from the northwest to the southeast. The last recorded position for the helicopter at 1433, indicated that it was at an altitude of 354 feet mean sea level (132 feet above ground level (AGL)), a heading of 150 degrees true and a calculated groundspeed of 43 knots. Forest Service employees reported that the flight pattern for firing is normally based on wind parameters and vegetative conditions to control for smoke management and burn results. According to the surviving crew member, the accident helicopter and crew completed a reconnaissance flight on the morning of the accident flight to evaluate the prescribed burn area. The AFF satellite tracking data showed that the flight was completed in approximately 72 minutes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe surviving crew member stated that he was operating a plastic sphere dispenser (PSD) from the rear right seat at the time of the accident. This device injects plastic spheres filled with potassium permanganate with glycol and dispenses them below the helicopter. Towards the end of the aerial ignition mission, the helicopter was in \"slow\" forward flight about 20 feet above the trees when the surviving crew member heard \"buzzers and alarms\" and the engine spool down. Almost simultaneously, the pilot announced \"we lost power\" and the firing boss remarked \"we are going in.\" The helicopter completed a quarter turn and \"slipped\" through the trees in a nose high attitude; it subsequently impacted the ground hard and came to rest on its left side. The surviving crew member did not receive a response from the front seat occupants despite his attempts to get their attention. The wreckage was not on fire after it came to rest, but the crew member observed an approaching ground fire from the controlled burn and decided to vacate the area to a nearby Forest Service road. The surviving crew member reported that the helicopter was in level forward flight at an estimated airspeed of approximately 50 knots when the pilot announced a loss of power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe audio files from the helicopter's aural warning system were played for the surviving crew member during a follow-up telephone conversation. The crew member recognized both alarms and arranged them in the following sequence: the sustained alarm immediately followed by the fast pulse alarm. According to the manufacturer, the sustained alarm corresponds with the low rpm horn and the fast pulse alarm is an engine out indication; however, the pulsed tone will sometimes follow the steady tone when a power loss occurs. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe surviving crew member recounted the events that transpired during a failed engine start attempt that occurred before the accident flight. He described hearing \"whine\" and \"clicking\" sounds with the absence of the turbine flame associated with a normal engine start. The second attempt resulted in a successful engine start, which was preceded by a \"click, click, click\" of the igniter followed by the flame of the turbine. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot by the Mississippi State Medical Examiner's Office, Jackson, Mississippi. The cause of death was listed as \"thermal injuries and smoke inhalation.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological testing on the pilot. No carbon monoxide, ethanol, or drugs were detected in the samples submitted. - According to a National Transportation Safety Board weather study, the observations at GPT and BXA indicated ceilings greater than 3,000 feet AGL at the surface at the time of the accident, no visibility restrictions, and variable wind. The wind reported at GPT at the time of the accident was from the south/southwest between 10 and 20 knots, and the wind at BXA reported a west/northwest wind between 5 and 15 knots. Witnesses reported the winds at the time of the accident were variable from the northwest and south at approximately 5 mph&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe environment was unstable from the surface through 8,000 feet mean sea level (msl), which would allow for air to rise and fall easily with lifting mechanisms in the area of the accident site. A sounding wind profile revealed the presence of low level wind shear between the surface and 1,000 feet msl, with several layers of clear air turbulence from the surface through 10,000 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA base reflectivity measurement indicated multiple targets at the accident site at the time of the accident, likely as a result of the smoke and particulates from the fire burning before, during and after the accident. While Forest Service personnel reported the presence of smoke in the area, there was little smoke at the accident site when the helicopter impacted the ground. - The pilot, age 40, held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter, airplane single engine land, and instrument airplane. He additionally held a mechanic's certificate with ratings for airframe and powerplant, which was issued on May 19, 2005. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second-class medical certificate was issued on February 23, 2015 with the limitation, \"must wear corrective lenses.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording the pilot's resumé, in 1998, he accepted a position as an aircraft technician with T&amp;M Aviation and subsequently received flight instruction from a company owner. After he obtained his private pilot certificate, he performed ferry flights for the company until 2005, when he received his commercial pilot certificate and was subsequently approved to fly under the company's Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 135 certificate. The pilot's flight experience between 2006 and the date of the accident, included agricultural spraying, long line external load, low level reconnaissance flights, and prescribed burn operations. Additionally, he maintained the company's helicopters as a mechanic during this time and served as the director of maintenance from 2010 through 2013. According to the aircraft owner's records, the pilot's most recent FAR Part 135.293 and FAR Part 135.299 recurrent check was completed on February 3, 2015 in a Bell 206 L3 helicopter. The pilot satisfactorily completed the proficiency check, which involved two emergency simulations; a stuck pedal, and an autorotation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nT&amp;M Aviation entered into a contract with the Forest Service on January 10, 2012 to conduct aerial ignition operations. Pilots of T&amp;M Aviation were required to complete an Interagency Helicopter Pilot Qualifications and Approval Record and pass a flight evaluation by an Interagency Helicopter Inspector Pilot. The pilot's most recent mission approval was completed on April 30, 2014, at which time he was approved to fly aerial ignition operations until April 30, 2015.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's personal flight logbooks, he had accumulated 6,471 total hours of flight experience, about 6,300 hours of which were in the accident helicopter make and model. The owner estimated that the pilot had accrued 22 additional flight hours in the 90 days that preceded the accident flight. - The accident site was located at the southern end of the controlled burn area in a wooded area about one quarter mile north of a road. An initial impact point (IIP) was identified by several 80-foot-tall broken trees, about 70 feet south of the main wreckage. The helicopter tail rotor marked the beginning of the debris path, which was located about 30 feet beyond the IIP on a northerly heading. The main wreckage was oriented northwesterly about 180 feet above msl and comprised of the cockpit, fuselage, engine, main rotor assembly, and main rotor blades. The high landing skid was in the debris path, a few feet aft of the main wreckage. The helicopter upper deck section, which included the main rotor, transmission, and collective/cyclic hydraulic servos, was attached to the fuselage and had sustained fire damage. The cockpit and cabin were destroyed by fire with the exception of the center window frame and portions of the instrument panel, which were co-located with the fuselage. Both main rotor blades sustained significant fire damage, but were attached to the main rotor hub: Blade A (the white blade) was slightly bent opposite the direction of the rotation and Blade B (the red blade) displayed two 45 degree chordwise bends. The tip to Blade B exhibited signs of overload separation that was consistent with impact forces and was located about 20 feet northeast of the main wreckage. Both the tail rotor and tailboom sustained fire damage and were co-located near a tree 20 feet south of the main wreckage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor assembly was located next to a tree and was separated from the tail rotor drive shaft. The tail rotor drive system was traced from the tail rotor through the gearbox to the steel tail rotor drive shaft that was mounted to the freewheeling unit on the engine gearbox. There were no indications of spline drive wear on the tail rotor spline shaft coupling at the freewheeling unit and the main drive shaft did not exhibit any resistance when moved forward and aft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit/cabin section came to rest on its left side and was destroyed by fire. The collective control was found in the cockpit area with the throttle mechanism exposed and in the idle position. Cyclic and collective control continuity from the cockpit to the hydraulic servos could not be attained due to fire damage. The helicopter upper deck section, including the main rotor assembly and transmission, was damaged by fire, but remained attached to the fuselage. Continuity was established from the collective/cyclic hydraulic servos to the swash plate and through overload fractures of the pitch change links. Hand rotation of the main drive shaft confirmed the presence of drive continuity through the main transmission to the main rotor blades. Both main rotor pitch change links exhibited signs of overload separation; the white blade link was separated at the swaged end and the red blade link separated about mid-span.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was recovered from the accident site and subsequently disassembled at the manufacturer's facility, under the supervision of the NTSB. Several accessories including the accessory gearbox, power turbine governor fuel control unit, and fuel pump could not be examined as they were consumed by post-crash fire. Both the right and left air discharge tubes displayed some impact damage, but were properly seated at their fore and aft ends. The compressor remained intact in its normal position and did not display any evidence of impact damage. The impeller and impeller shroud did not exhibit any rotational scoring and the no abnormalities were observed on the compressor scroll and diffuser.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe combustion section outer case remained in its normal position and was not damaged during the impact. The left side tube was dented and the forward end was seated on the scroll partially covered in molten metal. A visual inspection of the outer combustion case revealed the weld material on the mating flange to the left side air tube had melted and the tube shifted away from the mating flange. The combustion liner was not damaged and did not display any unusual burn patterns or streaking.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe N1 shafting turbine to compressor coupling and spur adapter gear were properly seated and exhibited heat damage. Both the power turbine inner and outer shafts were also in their proper positions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel pump was consumed by fire and the fuel lines were also damaged by fire, which precluded a complete examination of the fuel system. Although the fuel nozzle could not be separated due to thermal damage, a visual inspection of the nozzle revealed no abnormalities.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThermal damage prevented an examination of the accessory gearbox; however, several idler gears along with three oil pump gears, the torque meter gear and pinion gear were recovered from the accident site. Each gear displayed evidence of exposure to fire, but a visual inspection of the teeth and splines did not reveal any evidence of mechanical deformation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe turbine section contained two areas of light rotational scoring on the stage four nozzle blade track that displayed evidence of contact with the stage four wheel outer shroud knife seals.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotor Blade Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of photographs by a NTSB helicopter engineer revealed that both main rotor blades remained attached to the main rotor hub. One of the main rotor blades exhibited two chordwise bends along its span and its tip end was fractured and had separated from the blade. The leading edge of both main rotor blades did not exhibit evidence of damage consistent with high rotational energy. The afterbody and trailing edge of both main rotor blades exhibited multiple wrinkles along the blade span and was primarily heat distressed due to exposure to the postcrash fire. The main rotor hub remained attached to the main rotor shaft. The main rotor shaft exhibited impact marks from both main rotor flap stops.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine-to-main transmission drive shaft remained connected to the engine output flange, but the engine gearbox housing was consumed by the postcrash fire. The steel tail rotor drive output shaft (normally beneath the engine) remained connected on both ends via flexible couplings; the forward flexible coupling did not exhibit abnormal rotational damage and the aft flexible coupling exhibited slight openings between its laminates.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth tail rotor blades remained attached to the tail rotor hub and exhibited evidence of heat distress due to exposure to the postcrash fire. The leading edges of both tail rotor blades did not exhibit evidence of damage consistent with high rotational energy. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Approximately 5 minutes after the pilot departed he told air traffic control that he wanted to return to the airport, but did not specify a reason. The pilot was unable to make it back to the airport and collided with trees, powerlines, and a residence. Post-accident examination of the helicopter found that the lower swashplate left forward attachment ear had no rod end hardware present. A review of the helicopter's maintenance logbook revealed there were no entries regarding the repairs to the main rotor system; however, the helicopter's journey log revealed that several flight tests had been conducted due to a track and balance issue with the main rotor blades.  According the mechanic who performed the most recent maintenance to the swashplate, he did utilize the manufacturer's maintenance manual; however, he did not complete the work and the chief mechanic later completed the job. The chief mechanic did not make any entries into the logbook because he \"forgot.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe inflight loss of control was most likely caused by the detachment of the left front push-pull tube from the lower swashplate due to the liberation of the attachment bolt. The cause of the bolt liberation could not be conclusively determined because the attachment hardware could not be recovered.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter was a Robinson Helicopter Company model R44 II that was manufactured in 2007. It was powered by a Continental IO-540-AE1A5 engine, rated at 235 horsepower. The Hobbs meter was destroyed and per the journey log the last known recorded airframe total time was 1,267.5 hours on the day of the accident flight. The last annual inspection of the airframe and engine occurred on October 31, 2014, at an airframe total time of 1,092.1. The last recorded 100 hour inspection noted under discrepancies \"rotated TR pitch links\" on December 28, 2014, at an airframe total time of 1,186.1 hours. This was also the last maintenance entry made in the airframe logbook.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThough no recent maintenance entries were noted in the helicopter maintenance logbook, there were entries in its journey log (flight log of every flight) that several maintenance flights were conducted in support of attempts to track and balance the main rotor blades. The maintenance flights were identified by (MX or MTX) in the journey log. The first flight was conducted by another pilot on March 1, 2015, and the pilot stated that the MX flight was conducted for a track and balance of the main rotor blades. The next MX flight was conducted on March 6, 2015 and March 11, 2015, by another pilot who stated the flight was conducted for a track and balance of the main rotor blades. The last MX flight was conducted on March 15, 2015, and was signed off by the operator to show that the work was completed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a telephone interview, the mechanic who performed the most recent track and balance of the rotor blades stated he performed the job in accordance with the R44 Maintenance Manual section 10.230, the tail rotor in accordance with section 10.240 and the fan in accordance with section 6.240. He said that he did not complete the work and the chief mechanic later completed the job. The chief mechanic stated that he was not clear where the previous mechanic had finished the previous day. Further interviews with the chief mechanic, revealed that he performed the last check and reading of the track and balance of the main rotor blades. He also mentioned that he replaced the belt tensioning actuator gear motor on March 10, 2015, but \"forgot\" to make all of the entries in the helicopter's maintenance logbooks. - On March 22, 2015, about 1430 eastern daylight time, a Robinson Helicopter Company R44 II, N30242, impacted a two-story residence while maneuvering near Orlando, Florida. The private pilot and the two passengers were fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to a private individual and operated by HQ Aviation. The local flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight, which departed from Executive Airport (ORL), Orlando, Florida, shortly before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of voice transcriptions obtained from the Federal Aviation Administration revealed that the pilot contacted the ORL air traffic control tower to request his takeoff clearance. The pilot received a clearance, for a downtown departure leaving from the operator's helipad. Approximately 5 minutes later the pilot contacted the control tower and stated that he wanted to return to the operator's ramp.  There were no other transmissions made by the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMultiple witnesses reported hearing a loud helicopter flying low, which caught their attention. As they looked in the direction of the sound they observed the helicopter descending into a tree. One witness watched the helicopter's main rotor blades break apart as it descended through the trees. The helicopter subsequently impacted a power line transformer before colliding with the residence and erupted in flames. The witnesses called the local authorities and attempted to extinguish the fire. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot by the State of Florida District Nine Medical Examiner, Orlando, Florida.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Civil Aerospace Medical Institute performed forensic toxicology on specimens from the pilot, with negative results for drugs and alcohol. - The recorded weather at ORL, at 1453, included winds from 240 degrees at 10 knots; 10 statute miles visibility, few clouds at 4,900, temperature 30 degrees Celsius (C), dew point temperature 18 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.94 inches of mercury. - The pilot, age 48, held a private pilot certificate with a rating for rotorcraft-helicopter. A review of his logbook revealed he had a total flight experience of 124 hours, including 13 hours during the last 6 months. The pilot possessed a third-class medical certificate dated September 6, 2013, with no limitations or restrictions. Further examination of the pilot's logbook revealed he was signed off on August 9, 2014 for the special federal aviation regulation (SFAR) No. 73, which required him to have special training to operate the Robinson R-44. - Examination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter came to rest on the top floor of a two-story residence, about 3 miles northwest of ORL, and on a 360 degree magnetic heading. The wreckage debris field was about 50 yards in circumference. All flight control surfaces were located at the accident site. Examination of the wreckage revealed that a post-impact fire was concentrated within the second story of the building where the helicopter came to rest. A postcrash fire had consumed a majority of the wreckage. The main rotor mast, head, and gearbox were found separated from the main wreckage and within the debris field.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the cockpit and cabin section revealed that the instrument console was destroyed by impact forces and fire. The collective and anti-torque pedals were found within the wreckage. The mixture was found within the wreckage in the full rich position and impact damaged. Examination of the flight control system revealed that is was fire and impact damaged. At the lower swashplate, the left forward attachment ear had no rod end hardware present, and could not be located. The rod end was present at the top of the left push pull tube, which was found within the wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe swashplate and push pull tube with the attached rod end were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for further examination. The examination of the lower swashplate attachment lug bolt holes were examined for indications of damage or deformation. The side of the lug that butted up against the rod end was referred to as the \"rod end-side\" of the lug and the other side was referred to as the \"opposite side.\" The rod end-side of the front left push-pull tube attachment lug exhibited an outward deformation along the outer lower portion of the bolt hole. There were no other notable features on the front left lug nor were there any signs of deformation on any of the other lugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the hydraulic control servos revealed that they were intact and the two forward servos had bends in their shafts and could not be moved. The aft servo piston was free to move when force was applied. The tail rotor pitch change slider was free to slide along the tail rotor gearbox output shaft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the driveline revealed that the drive belts were completely burned away but displayed belt residue in the grooves of the upper and lower sheaves. The belt tension actuator was fractured between the anti-rotation scissors. The upper and lower actuator bearing were fire damaged. The lower bearing did not rotate when force was applied. The upper bearing rotated but dragged when force was applied. The sprag clutch was fire damaged and did not rotate. The forward flex coupling, main rotor gearbox input arm and main rotor gearbox was fractured.  Further examination of the main rotor gearbox revealed that it was fire damaged. The main rotor gear box did not rotate and the mast tube was fractured. The main rotor shaft was bent and fractured. The droop stops and droop stop tusk were intact and in place. There was scoring on the main rotor hub just inboard of the pitch change housings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth main rotor blades were accounted for at the crash site. One main rotor blade was intact and impact damaged. The rotor blade was bent downward and approximately 33 inches from the coning bolt and the spar was fractured.  The blade was distorted over the span of the blade and scored on the lower surface.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe opposite main rotor blade was fractured and scored on the lower surface.  Examination revealed it was bent upward from the coning bolt and approximately 12 inches further outboard bent downward. The spar was fractured in two areas on the rotor blade; 70 and 104 inches from the coning bolt. The blade spar had a forward bend at the outboard separation. A section of the skin and honeycomb separated from the spar at the bend. The main rotor blade was sent to the NTSB Material Laboratory for further examination, and examined for indications of fatigue failure. The pieces consisted of an approximately 95-inch long section of blade from the outboard tip to a fracture through the spar at the inboard end and a smaller piece of the blade consisting of the trailing edge, upper and lower skins, and honeycomb core. The small piece was separated from the rest of the blade by a chordwise fracture approximately 80 inch from the blade tip and a longitudinal fracture that proceeded inboard just aft of the spar. The deformation and fracture features on the blade were visually examined. The blade exhibited an aft bend that extended from the blade tip to the approximate position of the chordwise fracture, buckling of the upper and lower skins, and a comparatively severe forward bend at the inboard end. The fracture at the inboard end of the spar was located at a circular hole in the spar and exhibited 45° inclined fracture surfaces, consistent with an overstress fracture. No evidence of fatigue was observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe intermediate flex coupling was intact but impact damaged. The tail rotor driveshaft was separated a few inches forward of the tail rotor driveshaft damper. The tail rotor driveshaft damper bearing was fire and impact damaged and was not free to rotate. The friction linkage was intact, but separated from the tail cone and the linkage pivots were fire damaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom was separated from the main fuselage, and displayed fire damage. The tail rotor control tube was fractured at the fuselage, and remained attached to the tail rotor gearbox. The vertical fin and horizontal stabilizer were impact damaged and remained attached to the tail boom. The tail rotor blades were undamaged and remained intact to the gearbox. The aft flex coupling was intact. The tail rotor gearbox was intact and free to rotate, and contained blue oil.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the fuel system revealed that it was fire and impact damaged. The main fuel tank was not recovered. The auxiliary tank was distorted and the fuel cap was not recovered. The fuel tanks were not bladder-style tanks and were ruptured. The main fuel tank flexible outlet line was breached, but intact on the fuel valve. The fuel valve was in place and in the partially closed position. The gascolator was intact and was removed for examination and no debris was found in the fuel screen. The remaining fuel lines were fire damaged, but the fittings remained.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that when rotated by the cooling fan, continuity to the rear gears and valve train was confirmed. Compression and suction were observed on all four cylinders. Further examination of the engine revealed that the bottom of the sump was fire damaged and the fuel servo was not observed or recovered. The flow divider was intact and the fuel injector nozzles were removed and examined. The fuel injector nozzles were unobstructed. The engine driven fuel pump remained attached to the engine and was impact damaged. Examination of the magnetos revealed that they both remained attach to the engine. The left magneto was impact damaged, but when rotated by hand it sparked on all towers. The right magneto was fire damage and did not rotate. The top spark plugs were removed and top spark plugs and the electrodes were undamaged. The bottom spark plugs were not removed and examined using a borescope. The bottom spark plug electrodes were undamaged an oil soaked. Examination of the engine did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was conducting a positioning flight back to the base after conducting an emergency medical services flight during which a patient was transported to a hospital. According to one of the two medical crewmembers onboard the flight, the crew checked the weather before the flight, and the report showed ceilings at 8,500 ft. and 6 miles visibility at their intended destination and ceilings at 10,000 ft. at the departure location.    During the flight to transport the patient, the pilot stated that the clouds above their cruise altitude were lower than he expected. The pilot descended the helicopter and landed it at the hospital helipad without incident. While on the ground, the pilot checked the weather conditions again,   and they were the same. After the pilot conferred with the medical crew per their risk management procedures, they decided to return to their base as planned.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the accident flight, the helicopter was southbound at a cruise altitude of about 1,500 ft. mean sea level (msl) in an area with a terrain elevation of about 700 to 900 ft. msl, and dark night visual meteorological conditions existed. According to the medical crewmembers, about midway to their destination, the helicopter entered instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). After a brief discussion, during which one of the crewmembers told the pilot to go \"up,\" the pilot stated he was going to divert to another airport because he saw lights, and he then began a left turn.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough both crewmembers reported seeing trees and one of them told the pilot to \"pull up,\"   shortly after  , the helicopter impacted trees and terrain atop a wooded hill at an elevation of about 840 ft. msl, which resulted in the separation of the tailboom and portions of the fuselage; the main wreckage came to rest on its right side.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA meteorological reporting station located about 20 miles north-northwest of the accident location reported a broken ceiling at 2,400 ft. above ground level (agl) and 10 statute miles visibility at the time of the accident. Another meteorological reporting station located about 28 miles south of the accident location reported cloud bases between 900 and 2,100 ft. agl at the time of the accident. An examination of the helicopter revealed no preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely that the pilot experienced special disorientation during a turn after inadvertently entering IMC, which resulted in the helicopter descending into trees atop high terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nZolpidem, which is a prescription hypnotic medication used to treat insomnia and may impair mental and/or physical ability required to perform potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating heavy machinery, was detected in the pilot's blood and liver. Given it was not detected in the central blood, it could not be determined whether or to what extent it might have impaired the pilot  .",
    "FactualNarrative": "Per company information, in 2012, Eagle Med entered into the FAA's Safety Management System and established a risk management program. Risk mitigation procedures the company follows includes Crew Resource Management and their \"EagleMed Three to Go – One to Say No\" policy where it takes the consensus of all three crew members to agree to take a mission, but it only takes one crew member to say no to reject a flight. - The four-place, single-engine helicopter, serial number 4113, was configured for EMS transport. It was equipped with a single 143-gallon fuel tank and was powered by a 712-horsepower Turbomeca Arriel 1D1 turboshaft engine, serial number 19080.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the company's maintenance records revealed that the helicopter was maintained under a company aircraft inspection program and had undergone a 100-hour inspection on March 9, 2015, at total airframe time of 1,935.2 hours. The Hobbs meter was recovered at the accident site, and it read 1,941.5 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted a ramp inspection of the Eagle Med facility on March 11, 2015, that revealed discrepancies with the night vision goggle (NVG) lighting system and the radio altimeter indicator. The NVG system and radio altimeter were deferred until a 100-hour inspection could be completed on the NVG system and a filter could be replaced on the radio altimeter indicator. Until that was completed, helicopter night vision goggle operations were not permitted. - On March 12, 2015, about 2315 central daylight time, a Eurocopter AS350 B2 helicopter, N919EM, impacted trees and terrain while maneuvering near Eufaula, Oklahoma. The commercial pilot was fatally injured, and the two medical crewmembers sustained serious injuries. The helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Eagle Med, LLC, Wichita, Kansas, as Eagle Med 35, a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 emergency medical services (EMS) positioning flight. Dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident, and a company visual flight rules flight plan had been filed. The helicopter departed from St. Francis Hospital Heliport (4OK3), Tulsa, Oklahoma, about 2248 and was destined for McAlester Regional Airport (MLC), McAlester, Oklahoma.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the two medical crewmembers, one of whom was an emergency medical technician (EMT) and one of whom was a flight nurse, the crew checked the weather before the previous flight to transfer a patient to 4OK3, and the report showed ceilings at 8,500 ft and 6 miles visibility at MLC and ceilings at 10,000 ft. at 4OK3. During the flight to transport the patient, the pilot stated that the clouds above their cruise altitude were lower than he expected. The pilot descended the helicopter and then landed it at 4OK3 without incident. While on the ground at 4OK3, the pilot checked the weather conditions again    , and they were the same. The pilot conferred with the medical crew per their risk management procedures, and they decided to return to MLC as planned. The helicopter took off and headed southbound at a cruise altitude of about 1,500 ft. mean sea level (msl) in an area with a terrain elevation of about 700 to 900 ft. msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe EMT, seated in the far left back seat, stated that they were about halfway to MLC when they suddenly entered instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). He recalled the pilot saying that this was \"not good.\" He told the pilot to climb to 3,500 ft., but he did not think the pilot initiated a climb. He also told the pilot that he could see lights on the horizon. The pilot asked him to \"tell him about those lights.\" He told the pilot, \"They are to the left\" and gestured a left turn with his hands.    The EMT said that he then saw a strobe flash and trees and said, \"pull up,\" but the helicopter crashed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight nurse, seated in the far right back seat, stated that as they departed the Tulsa area, she began monitoring their route on the chart. She added that they were practicing a procedure regarding inadvertently encountering     IMC when the EMT said, \"We're in a cloud.\" The pilot responded, \"What do I do now?\" and the EMT answered, \"go up.\" The pilot then said that he was proceeding to Okmulgee, Oklahoma, because he could see lights to the left. He then said, \"I'm turning left.\" When he started the turn, the EMT began yelling \"pull up.\" The pilot then said, \"What's that noise?\" The EMT responded, \"that's your 500\"      (altitude warning). The flight nurse said she started seeing trees and then did not see or hear anything after that.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter had an EMS Sky Connect GPS transmitter that sent 39 messages to the company containing location information and device power status. The last three messages showed the helicopter as it approached the accident site. The third-from-the-last message showed the helicopter on a 173° heading at 414 ft. and a ground speed of 118 knots. The next-to-last message showed the helicopter on a 146° heading at 397 ft. and a ground speed of 110 knots. The last message showed the helicopter on a 172° heading at 380 ft. and a ground speed of 119 knots. - The Board of Medical Investigations, Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Eastern Division, Tulsa, Oklahoma, conducted an autopsy of the pilot. The pilot's death was attributed to \"multiple blunt impact injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory conducted toxicology testing on the pilot's specimens. The tests detected zolpidem in the pilot's blood and liver. Zolpidem is a prescription hypnotic medication used to treat insomnia and may impair mental and/or physical ability required to perform potentially hazardous tasks such as driving or operating heavy machinery. - A   meteorological reporting station was located at Okmulgee Regional Airport, Okmulgee, Oklahoma, about 20 miles north-northwest of the accident location at an elevation of about 720 ft. A 2315 automated weather report indicated wind from 020° at 3 knots, visibility of 10 statute miles or greater, ceiling broken at 2,400 ft. above ground level (agl), broken cloud layer base at 3,000 ft. agl, temperature 12° C, dew point temperature 11° C, and an altimeter setting of 30.13 inches of m   ercury. From 2015 to 2315, the reported cloud layer was generally at or above 5,000 ft. agl; however, at 2255 (20 minutes before the accident), the reported cloud layer was scattered at 1,100 ft. agl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA meteorological reporting station was located at MLC about 28 miles south of the accident location at an elevation of 770 ft. At 2053, MLC reported overcast clouds with bases at 9,000 ft. agl. Beginning at 2153 and continuing through the accident time, MLC automated reports indicated that the lowest cloud bases were between 900 and 2,100 ft. agl. - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with single-engine land airplane, helicopter, and instrument ratings. On August 23, 2014, he was issued a second-class medical certificate with no limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCompany records showed that the pilot had flown 2,384.7 total hours and 7.6 hours in the 30 days before the accident. The records also showed that the pilot successfully completed a flight review in the accident make and model helicopter on February 24, 2014. - After impact, the surviving medical crewmembers egressed the helicopter wreckage, and the EMT immediately called company dispatch to report the accident and their location. Several agencies then used the position report from the crew, data from the on-board GPS, and signals from the 406-MHz emergency locator transmitter to locate the wreckage. Emergency responders hiked in dark night conditions through remote rugged terrain and arrived at the crew's location several hours later. - The accident site was located atop a wooded hill on an embankment next to a creek about 9 miles west of Eufaula at an elevation of 840 ft. msl. The helicopter came to rest on its right side and was oriented on an easterly heading. (See figure 1 for a photograph showing the accident site and main wreckage.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1. A photograph showing the accident site and main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe initial impact point was a tree about 190 ft. west of the main wreckage. Several trees in the immediate vicinity of the helicopter were broken and showed marks that corresponded with impact marks on the helicopter's fuselage and rotor blades. The wreckage debris path was on a bearing of 093° from the initial tree impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage consisted of the cabin, fuselage, fuel tank, engine, transmission, main rotor system, and left skid. The cockpit area, including the instrument panel, windscreens, right side pilot seat, medical litter, and chin windows, was broken downward, separated, and fragmented. The horizontal situation indicator was found with the heading stopped at 093°, the course selector needle was found set to 175°, and the heading bug was found set to 240°. The right cockpit and cabin doors were broken out, twisted, and fragmented. The left cabin and cockpit doors were also broken out. The left cabin door rested on the left skid, and the left cockpit door was behind the helicopter fuselage. The left skid was undamaged. The aft portion of the fuselage was broken upward and twisted about 45° to the right.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe transmission and engine were broken downward and aft but remained intact. The main rotor system mast and head remained attached to the transmission. The three blades remained attached at the head but were displaced aft. The outboard leading edges of all three blades showed gouges and fractures. One blade was bent downward 30° about 5 ft. outboard of the rotor head. The outboard portion of the blade was broken aft about 4 ft. from the bend. The other two blades were broken aft about 5 ft. outboard of the rotor head.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel tank remained intact. During wreckage recovery, about 60 gallons of clean, uncontaminated fuel were removed from the tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdjacent to the right side of the helicopter fuselage, in and along the creek and on the opposite side of the creek, were broken pieces of the right skid, flight publications, medical equipment, pieces of the cabin interior, the right cockpit door, and parts of the right cockpit door frame. The pilot seat was located along the creek aft of the helicopter fuselage. The pilot seat was intact and the restraints were connected. It was separated from the floor track.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom was separated about 2 ft. aft of the fuselage, was resting upright on the ground about 55 ft. aft of the main wreckage, and was oriented west-northwest, opposite the main wreckage. The top and bottom vertical stabilizers were broken aft. The left horizontal stabilizer was intact but showed upward bends at the inboard trailing edge and aft tip. The right horizontal stabilizer was bent and broken upward and twisted aft. A 6-ft-long piece of broken tree trunk was located beneath the left horizontal stabilizer and along the left side of the tailboom. The tail rotor hub and blades were attached and located beneath the tail rotor gear box. One tail rotor blade was broken near the hub but remained attached. Both blades showed chordwise scratches, and the leading edges and ends of the blades showed bends and gouges. The tail rotor drive shaft was separated torsionally at the connection to the tail rotor gear box and fractured torsionally about 30 inches outboard of the gear box. The drive shaft was also separated about 4 ft. forward of where the tailboom was separated from the fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPedal and cyclic control to the main and tail rotor systems was established. The helicopter and all the separated components were recovered for further examination. The examination of the engine, transmission, flight controls, and other systems revealed no preimpact anomalies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree personal electronic devices were recovered from the wreckage and sent to the National Transportation Safety Board's Vehicle Performance Laboratory for examination and data extraction; no data pertinent to the accident were extracted.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The emergency medical service (EMS) helicopter was landing on a privately owned elevated heliport to pick up two medical crewmembers. The medical crewmembers had been dropped off with a patient on a preceding flight. During the preceding flight, the nurse thought about telling the pilot to abort the landing on the heliport because there was a lot of rolling and yawing, and he was having a hard time landing the helicopter. After the landing, the nurse and another medical crewmember stated that the pilot did not want to depart the heliport, but the medical crewmembers told the pilot that there may be potential arrivals of other EMS helicopters. The pilot chose to depart the heliport and obtained fuel at the operator's base of operations. For the return flight to pick up the two medical crewmembers, the wind had increased, and the helicopter approached the heliport in high-wind conditions and with a right, quartering tailwind. Also, the wind along with the surrounding buildings likely created a turbulent airflow/windshear environment in which the helicopter was operating as it approached for landing. The helicopter's operation in a high-power, low-airspeed condition in high-wind conditions, including a right quartering tailwind, likely resulted in a loss of control due to settling with power. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA security video showed the helicopter on a northerly flightpath descending at about a 45-degree angle before impacting the ground and coming to rest on an approximate northerly heading. The pilot sustained fatal injuries due to the subsequent fuel tank fire/explosion, which otherwise would have been a survivable accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident safety evaluation of the heliport showed that the final approach and takeoff area/safety area were obstructed by permanent and semi-permanent objects that pose a serious hazard to helicopter operations. These obstructions limited the available approach paths to the heliport, which precludes, at times, approaches and landings with a headwind. The helipad is privately owned; therefore, it is not subject to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification or regulation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the helicopter's flight manual revealed that there were no wind speed/azimuth limitations or suggested information available to pilots to base the performance capabilities of the make and model helicopter in their flight planning/decision-making process. Examination of the helicopter revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation and showed engine power at the time of impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n An accredited representative from the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) was assigned to this investigation as the state of manufacture of the helicopter. The BEA provided comments on this report, which can be found in the docket.",
    "FactualNarrative": "N356AM was a 2010 Airbus Helicopters (Eurocopter) EC-130-B4, serial number 7006, which was configured for EMS operations under Part 135. The helicopter was powered by a Turbomeca Arriel 2B1 turboshaft engine, serial number 46489.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter underwent its last inspection on March 5, 2015 at an airframe and engine total time of 1,378.4 hours, which was also the engine total time since new. - Destination Helipad&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe MO55 helipad is privately owned and was not subject to meeting regulatory requirements for helideck design requirements by the FAA and adherence to those regulatory requirements were voluntary.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA letter by an FAA Airports Airspace Data Specialist, dated August 19, 1986, stated that following an on-site inspection of MO55 on May 7, 1986 or the 210 foot by 150 foot landing/takeoff area and a 50 foot by 50 foot touchdown area. The letter stated that there is adequate ingress/egress greater than 8-1, in two directions, 180 degrees apart. The letter stated that the aeronautical study of the proposed heliport [MO55] would adversely affect that safe and efficient use of airspace by an aircraft unless the following conditions are maintained:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nClear approach/departure paths to the landing area for a minimum 8:1 glide slope . Obstruction clearance planes (glide slope), aligned with the direction of the approach/departure paths, extend outward and upward from the landing/takeoff area to the en route altitude at an angle of 8 feet horizontally to 1 foot vertically (8:1).    A clear transitional surface for a minimum 2:1 slope. The transitional surface extends outward and upward from the edges of the landing/takeoff area and approach/departure clearance planes at an angle of 2 feet horizontally to 1 foot vertically (2:1) to a distance of 250 feet from the center of the landing and takeoff area and 250 feet from the centerline of the approach/departure clearance surfaces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB IIC requested that the FAA perform post-accident inspection of MO55, which was performed on April 16, 2015. The inspection results were documented in a Heliport Safety Evaluation Report, Case Number: 2015–ACE–1749–NRA. The report cited 10 obstructions within the final approach and takeoff area (FATO)/safety area of the heliport/helipad and 4 obstructions outside the FATO/safety area.  The 10 obstructions outside the FATO/safety area had a ranged in azimuth from 005 – 236 degrees and there were no obstructions from 236 – 005 degrees, or west, northwest.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1:   Obstructions Outside the FATO/Safety Area&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 2: Obstructions Inside the FATO/Safety Area&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe report's recommendations for ingress/egress stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"The heliport FATO/safety area is obstructed by permanent and semi-permanent objects that pose a serious hazard to helicopter operations. The most serious obstructions cannot be easily lowered or removed. Flight Standards cannot recommend an approach/departure route into or out of a hazardous area that does not appear to have reasonable alternatives for mitigation. Therefore, no recommendation for ingress/egress is made in this case.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe medic said if there is a lot of wind, it is \"always weird\" coming in for approach to land at MO55. The nurse said that her knowing the area and the St Louis University Hospital helipad (MO55), she knew that it was going to be a \"hard landing\" on a good day.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA pilot that was not employed by Air Methods stated that he had flown in a Eurocopter \"a handful of times. He said that flying into MO55 \"is not the hardest pad but it's a difficult pad especially when the winds are at different angles and you have a lot of mechanical turbulence.\" The winds come around the building and can create a tailwind. Obstructions to the pad are the elevator shaft and buildings surround the pad. He takes new hire helicopter pilots and shows them the mechanical turbulence associated during flight training. He said that if \"don't get set up at the right altitude and closure rate\" for at MO55, you can \"find yourself in a bad situation.\" He said the Baris hospital is \"definitely more difficult to get into [than] MO55; you can have a headwind one minute and have a tailwind the next minute.\" He flies a Bell 206, which he said is not as strong as a Eurocopter 130 tailrotor. You can get into loss of tail rotor effectiveness approaching the wrong way during landing. His personal wind limitations are 25 knots with a gust spread of 10-12 knots. He feels \"comfortable\" with \"steady winds of 25 knots.\" He said the Cardinal Glennon (MU52) hospital had a ground based helipad and using a ground pad required an arrangement to be made to transport a patient via an ambulance to the ground pad.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNearest Ground Based Helipad &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe nearest ground based helipad was MU52, which was located about 0.4 nautical miles west of MO55. The availability and its method of ground transportation from MO55 to MU52 prior to the accident was unknown to the investigation. - A post-crash fire and explosion occurred upon impact when the helicopter impacted the parking lot adjacent to the building entrance which was captured by a security video. The following two frames from a security camera show the explosion and fire that ensued after the helicopter's impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 3: The top video frame at 11:17:14 PM shows the fire/explosion during the impact of N356AM and the bottom frame at 11:17:17 PM shows a fire ball separated from the initial fire and moved upwards and to the left of the screen in a direction consistent with approximate wind direction. - On March 6, 2015, at 2310 central standard time, an Airbus Helicopters (Eurocopter) EC-130-B4, N356AM, operated by Air Methods (doing business as ARCH), struck the edge of a hospital building and impacted its parking lot during a visual approach to the St Louis University Hospital elevated rooftop helipad (MO55), St Louis, Missouri. During the approach, the helicopter experienced a loss of directional control and entered an uncontrolled descent. The helicopter was destroyed by impact forces and a post-crash fire. The commercial pilot, who was the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. The helicopter was operated under Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as an air medical positioning flight that was operating on a company flight plan. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight was returning to MO55 after it had been refueled at the operator's base located at Arch Heliport (MU05), St. Louis, Missouri.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight's first approach and landing at MO55 was to drop off a medic, nurse, and a patient, who was not in critical condition. The flight release for the flight and the accident flight had a green weather status, whose criteria is solely based upon ceilings and visibility. The risk assessment, which was completed for the flight and not for the accident flight, was assessed as low.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe medic said that he had been employed as a medic for about a year and flew on previous flights that landed at MO55 \"couple of times\" and had flown with other Air Methods pilots. The nurse stated that she began employment at Air Methods in January 2015 and she had two years of experience with another aviation company.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe medic stated that during the first approach for landing to MO55 with the pilot, the pilot said that there was a 25 knot wind, but the medic did not know the source of the pilot's wind information. The medic said that the wind sock on the helipad was illuminated and pointing \"straight out\" towards the elevator shaft (the elevator shaft was located toward the northeast) next to the helipad. During the approach, the helicopter tail was \"sideways a little bit.\" The pilot said it was going to be \"a little rough\" and that \"it was a little windy.\" The medic said that the approach was \"straight-in,\" and he felt a \"little drop\" when they came in. The helicopter did not slow down during the approach. The approach felt lower than usual and about 10-20 feet lower than that used by other pilots he had flown with and seemed closer to the elevator than the middle of the helipad while the helicopter was about a \"football field\" or \"half of a football field\" away from the helipad. The nose of the helicopter was directed away from elevator and the pilot would \"straighten out\" the helicopter when it was closer in.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe nurse said that there was \"a lot of rolling\" and \"a lot of yawing\" during the approach to MO55. Over the helipad, the pilot was having a \"hard time\" and \"a couple of more seconds\" she would had told him to abort the landing and to do another \"recon.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe medic said that after landing, the pilot needed to shut down the helicopter at MO55 to remove a helicopter seat.  After the helicopter shutdown, the pilot said that he wanted to stay on the helipad, but the medic told the pilot that the helicopter could not remain on the helipad because there were other helicopters coming in. The nurse stated that it was not a \"typical thing to do\" to have the helicopter remain on the helipad because other helicopter arrivals. The nurse stated that the pilot did not tell her why he wanted to remain on the helipad, but her \"gut reaction was that it was a hard landing and he did not want to do that again.\" She said it was \"difficult\" to get the helicopter skids onto the helipad.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight then departed to obtain fuel at MU05 (located about 1.3 nautical miles from MO55). Upon refueling, the flight returned to MO55, to pick up the medic and nurse. Neither the medic nor the nurse saw the helicopter takeoff from MO55 for the flight to refuel at MU05.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe nurse stated that at 2258 she sent a text message to the pilot stating that they were ready to be picked up from MO55, and he responded in text that he was on his way. She said that at 2309, she looked at the time and thought it was \"taking a while for his return.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident occurred during the flight's return, during approach for landing, at MO55.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness stated that he was sitting in his truck parked across from the St Louis University Hospital emergency room when he saw a light shine on his truck, \"the light was coming closer and closer.\" After a while the light turned around and disappeared \"quick.\"  The light shined for about two minutes. His truck was facing west because it was parked on Vista, which is a one way street. The light shined on the truck for about two minutes. The light turned sideways, and it was a clear white light. The other lights he saw on the back of the helicopter \"looked like red and green\" from the tail. He said he could not hear the helicopter. The helicopter was \"coming forward\" and it took a \"little tail spin\" before it went out of sight. The helicopter went north and \"went down.\" He saw the helicopter \"side\" and \"back\" and then it went down. He did not see any fire from the helicopter before the accident. He did not hear any noise after it went out of sight. He said that his truck was parked across from the hospital ambulance entrance. He said the helicopter made a \"regular turn\" and he could see its side, which was to his left before it went down. He saw it \"spin only once and not more.\" He said the helicopter was pointing \"straight down as it turned left.\" He said it was not \"quite straight down\" and the light was shining on the ground as it was going down on an angle. He said that he did not see the helicopter \"wobble.\" He said a security guard came out and walked down Thistle. The witness said he got out of his truck, and the wind was \"going pretty hard\" going north. He said that helicopter was about 15 feet above the overhead tunnel between the hospital and hospital garage. He did not see the bottom of the helicopter because of the light. He said the wind was not shaking his truck when he was sitting inside of it. - An autopsy of the pilot was conducted by the Office of the Medical Examiner City of St. Louis on March 7, 2015. The autopsy report stated the cause of death as \"Thermal Burns and Smoke Inhalation.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Final Forensic Toxicology Fatal Accident Report of the pilot stated: no carbon monoxide detected in Blood (Femoral), cyanide- not performed, volatiles – no ethanol detected in vitreous, drugs – no listed drugs detected in urine. - The 2100 sounding wind profile indicated there was a surface wind from 183 degrees at 7 knots and the wind speed increased to 25 knots by 1,300 feet msl and became southwesterly. The sustained wind speed reached up to 30 knots at 2,000 feet msl. At 0000, similar wind conditions persisted though the inversion height now reached up to 2,100 feet msl with the wind speed around 40 knots at 2,000 feet msl, just below the top of the inversion height. This inversion height is critical with the stable air below 2,000 feet msl, as any mixing of the wind speed and direction below 2,000 feet msl would have caused moderate or greater turbulence and low-level wind shear (LLWS). RAOB also indicated likely LLWS below 3,000 feet msl at both 2100 and 0000 CST along with clear air turbulence being likely from the surface through 6,500 feet msl. As soon as the accident flight took off it would have likely experienced LLWS, clear air turbulence, and wind speeds up to 40 knots between the surface and 2,000 feet msl. Given the upper air charts, these wind speeds above the surface would have been expected. - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument-helicopter ratings issued on June 24, 1992. Air Methods reported on National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Accident Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident/Incident (Form 6120) that the pilot accumulated a total time of 2,614 hours, all of which was in rotorcraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA blue ribbon airman certification file for the pilot, he was issued a commercial pilot certificate based upon military competence obtained in the US Army and had flown at least 10 hours as pilot-in-command during the last 12 months in the following military aircraft: UH-1. Section III, Record of Flight Time was not completed upon the application for his commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument-helicopter ratings. A record of his military competence, Army DA Form 759, Individual Flight Record and Flight Certificate, was not in the airman certification file nor was it required to be submitted by the examiner that issued the pilot's commercial pilot certificate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had applied for employment as a pilot at another EMS operator in the summer of 2013. According to the operator's regional director of flight operations during that time, he interviewed the pilot and went through the pilot's qualifications using the pilot's resume. The director of flight operations stated that he did not feel confident in the pilot's flight times. Another regional director for the EMS operator called someone at Ft. Campbell, Kentucky to verify if the pilot's PIC flight time in AH-64 helicopters and found out that the pilot had \"very limited PIC time in the AH-64.\" The director of operation that had interviewed the pilot said that following the interview, the pilot contacted him 2 or 3 times but was told he was not being considered for employment. The pilot did not provide Army Form 759 for the EMS operator following the interview.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's resume that was on file with Air Methods, he had been previously employed as a EC-130 pilot by for air tour operations as of May 5, 2013 and listed his total flight time prior to his employment at Air Methods as 2,244.7 hours, \"military helicopter\" of 2,244.7 hours, and pilot-in-command (PIC) time of 1,155.7 hours. The \"type ratings\" listed on the resume were: Airbus Helicopters (Eurocopter) EC-130-B4, Bell UH-1, Bell AH-1, Boeing AH-64A and Bowing AH-64D helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's date of hire with Air Methods was October 21, 2013 and he reported, on his application for employment dated October 22, 2013, a total aircraft time all of which were in helicopters 2,503.4 hours, 1338.8 hours PIC, 168.7 hours at night unaided, and 674.8 hours with night vision goggles. He reported upon the application, that he had the following flight times by aircraft make and model: EC 130-B4 – 250 hours, UH-1 and AH-1 – 233 hours, and AH-64 – 2,015.4 hours. The pilot reported on his application that he had 0 years of experienced working as an air medical pilot under Part 135 and had 0 hours of air medical flight time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn November 20, 2013, the pilot successfully completed his initial Part 135 293a, 293b, and 299 checkride provided by a company check airman for EC130 helicopters and his transition to EC130 NVG on the same date.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 1, 2013, he was assigned as an EC130/EC130NVG pilot based at R07.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAir Method's and the pilot's previous employer did not have a copy of the pilot's Army Form 759. A copy of the form was requested from the pilot's wife by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Investigator-In-Charge (IIC), but the form was not received during the accident investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had no previous FAA record of incident, accidents, or enforcement actions. - The autopsy determined the cause of death was thermal burns and smoke inhalation. It described severe thermal injuries to the entire body including multiple thermal fractures and soot deposition in the respiratory tract from the trachea to the bilateral bronchial tree. Traumatic injuries included a hairline fracture of the frontal bone, a sternal fracture, and a fracture of the fifth cervical vertebra without evidence of a spinal cord injury. Subarachnoid blood was attributed to extension of blood from the fracture in the cervical spine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe autopsy identified coronary artery disease including 80 percent narrowing of the left anterior descending coronary artery. However, no focal lesions (evidence of an old or new heart attack) were identified in the heart muscle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 23, 2016, the NTSB issued Safety Recommendations A-16-11 and A-16-8 through -10 pertaining to Airbus Helicopters EC-130-B4 and AS-350-B3e. Two 2015 accidents, one of which involved N356AM, had impact forces survivable for occupants but fatal and serious injuries occurred because of postcrash fires that resulted from an impact-related breach in the fuel tanks. - Aircraft Performance Study&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no sufficient radar data or nonvolatile memory aboard the helicopter to perform a performance study of the helicopter's accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSecurity Video&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the security video cited in the Fire section of this report, showed at about 11:16:52 PM, a light consistent in white color and shape of the helicopter landing light shining onto the hospital building facing the parking lot entrance where the helicopter later impacted. The light then moves toward the right edge of the building and about 11:17:03 PM, the light moves left, off the building. About 11:17:06 PM, a flash of white colored light appears in the camera. About 11:17:08 PM, the light moves from right to left across the hospital building face as a declination at an estimated approximate angle of 45 degrees. About 11:17:11 PM, the helicopter comes into view and descending at a similar declination angle and direction as was the light.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSettling With Power (Vortex Ring State)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21A), Chapter 11, Helicopter Emergencies and Hazards:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"Vortex ring state describes an aerodynamic condition in which a helicopter may be in a vertical descent with 20 percent up to maximum power applied, and little or no climb performance. The term \"settling with power\" comes from the fact that the helicopter keeps settling even though full engine power is applied. In a normal out-of-ground-effect (OGE) hover, the helicopter is able to remain stationary by propelling a large mass of air down through the main rotor. Some of the air is recirculated near the tips of the blades, curling up from the bottom of the rotor system and rejoining the air entering the rotor from the top. This phenomenon is common to all airfoils and is known as tip vortices. Tip vortices generate drag and degrade airfoil efficiency. As long as the tip vortices are small, their only effect is a small loss in rotor efficiency. However, when the helicopter begins to descend vertically, it settles into its own downwash, which greatly enlarges the tip vortices. In this vortex ring state, most of the power developed by the engine is wasted in circulating the air in a doughnut pattern around the rotor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCritical Wind Azimuth or Maximum Safe Relative Wind Chart&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Helicopter Flying Handbook, Chapter 7, Helicopter Performance:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"The wind direction is also an important consideration. Headwinds are the most desirable as they contribute to the greatest increase in performance. Strong crosswinds and tailwind may require the use of more tail rotor thrust to maintain directional control. This increased tail rotor thrust absorbs power from the engine, which means there is less power available to the main rotor for the production of lift. Some helicopters even have a critical wind azimuth or maximum safe relative wind chart. Operating the helicopter beyond these limits could cause loss of tail rotor effectiveness.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAir Methods operates two other makes and models of single-engine helicopters, a Bell 407 GX and an AgustaWestland AW 119, both of whose flight manuals provide speed/azimuth wind charts. A review of the EC 130-B4 flight manual does not provide speed/azimuth envelope and the only guidance provided for the helicopter's stability and control relative to speed/azimuth was:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the Eurocopter EC 130 B4 Flight Manual, Revision 9, revealed that the manual did not contain wind limits nor critical wind azimuth or maximum safe relative wind chart.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the accident investigation, the NTSB Investigator-In-Charge requested that Airbus Helicopters perform a critical azimuth analysis and in response to that request, Airbus Helicopters provided the following charts showing pedal control and power required to maintain an out of ground effect hover relative to azimuth/wind speed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 4: The plot shows percentage of foot position versus azimuth at wind speeds from 0-50 knots. The left stop limit occurs at azimuths of about 103 degrees to 138 degrees with a wind of 50 knots. The right pedal stop occurs at azimuths of about 230 degrees to 253 degrees at a wind speed of 40 knots; the azimuth range for the right pedal stop increases with increasing wind speeds of 45 knots and 50 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 5: Plot of power necessary versus azimuth at wind speeds from 0-50 knots. The upper limit of power occurred at approximate azimuth of 223 degrees to 290 degrees with a wind speed of 50 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPerspective of Handling Qualities of the EC-130-B4&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA pilot flying emergency medical service helicopters since 2004. He said he had flown helicopters that included the BK136, EC130, Jet Ranger and \"Hughey.\" He has a total flight time of about 17,000 hours, of which 9,700 hours are in helicopters. He said he had flown Chinook, Black Hawk, and OH58 helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe stated that flying into MO55 is \"not that bad\" for those pilots who are used to flying into confined areas. He said that the approach into MO55 is \"almost a one way in and one way out.\" If there is a right or left crosswind, the approach into MO55 can be difficult but nothing that an experienced pilot can handle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe said that the EC130 vertical fin is \"extremely affected by a lot of wind,\" and he had to apply tail rotor pedal input to the pedal stops on certain occasions. The pedals are not boosted but are manual. He said that about every 100 hours or \"a little over,\" the EC130 can have exhaust gases contaminate the blade roots of the Finestron. There is Teflon tape on the blade roots that allow for blade mobility. The exhaust contaminate may cause the blades to stick, which \"can be felt in the rudder pedals.\" He said that in \"only extreme cases the blades will stick.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen asked what his personal wind limits were, he said that if he is not \"comfortable\" with an approach/landing, he will fly to another landing zone.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccident Flight Risk Assessment&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot completed a company risk assessment form dated March 6, 2015 with a time of 1751 for the flight to MO55 to drop off the medic, nurse and patient and a risk assessment total of low, which equated to 28; the flight request subtotal was 15 and the shift change subtotal was 13. Low risk was defined on the form to have a value of less than 30, and medium risk was defined with a value of 30-49. Item 3 of the form, pilot has less than 3,000 total rotor wing flight hours, which had a value of 4, was left blank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn accredited representative from the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) was assigned to this investigation as the state of manufacture of the helicopter. The BEA provided comments on this report, which can be found in the docket. - The main wreckage of the helicopter was located near the west parking lot entrance of the hospital. The wreckage and its debris were over an area estimated to be about 30 feet in diameter. The helicopter was oriented approximately toward the northeast as viewed from its tail to nose. There were blue colored witness marks alongside the top of the northern side of the west entrance for the building that were consistent with a strike by the helicopter tail.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage confirmed flight control continuity of the tail rotor drive system. Due to impact and fire damage, functional testing of the flight control system could not be performed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed that several of the axial blades exhibited foreign object damage. The gas generator and accessory gearbox could not be rotated by hand. The free turbine blades did not shed and could not be rotated by hand. The engine and helicopter were recovered to a salvage yard for further investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll fuel, oil, and air connections were attached and their hoses sustained fire damage. The digital engine control unit was destroyed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accessory gearbox magnetic plug was broken due to impact forces and could not be examined as well as the electronic chip detector. The reduction gearbox magnetic plug did not display metallic debris. The oil and fuel filters did not contain debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe reduction gearbox was removed and the input pinion alignment mark was in the over-torqued 4mm position, consistent with the engine providing power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUpon removal of the gearbox, the free turbine could be rotated by hand but the powershaft still could not be rotated. The front support and liaison tube were removed and then the powershaft rotated freely and proper freewheel operation was confirmed. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The flight instructor and the student pilot were conducting a local instructional flight in the helicopter. The helicopter was on final approach to land when one of the three main rotor blades (#2 blade) separated from the main rotor head. The main transmission and main rotor head (with #1 and #3 blades still attached) then separated from the helicopter, and the helicopter descended to ground impact. Examination of the wreckage revealed that the separation of the #2 blade was due to fracture of the #2 main rotor blade spindle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe #2 spindle fractured at the inboard end of the threads. Metallurgical analysis of the fractured spindle revealed signatures consistent with a fatigue crack initiating from multiple origins that propagated across 92% of the spindle cross-section; the remaining 8% of the fracture surface exhibited signatures consistent with overload. The high percentage of stable fatigue fracture growth versus overload suggested that low loading propagated the crack. Further, corrosion was visible on the fracture surface in the fatigue initiation area, which indicated that the crack had been present and growing for some time. Similar fatigue cracks were observed emanating from thread roots on the #1 and #3 spindles; the crack in the #3 spindle emanated from the inboard-most thread, similar to the crack in the #2 spindle, and the crack in the #1 spindle emanated from the cotter pin hole. Both of these cracks were shorter than the crack in the #2 spindle, and the fatigue on their fracture surfaces had only propagated a small amount through the #1 and #3 spindle cross-sections.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe root radii of the threads on all three of the spindles did not meet the thread form specified on the manufacturer's drawing. Cross-sections of the threads from the three spindles showed that the #2 spindle and the #3 spindle had flat-bottomed threads; the #1 spindle did not have flat-bottomed threads but had threads with a sharper than specified root radius. A subsequent finite element analysis determined that the flat-bottomed threads and the sharper than specified root radius threads would result in higher stresses at the threads, which likely contributed to the crack initiation within the threads. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther, the investigation determined that the predicted loads used in the original fatigue analysis during the design of the spindle did not account for a bending load at the spindle threads. The omission of bending loads during design and the flat-bottom quality of the threads led to stresses greater than used in the original fatigue life calculation by the manufacturer. Further, the finite element analysis of the spindle revealed that, once a crack has initiated, the bending loads at the spindle threads would be sufficient to propagate the crack at a rate similar to that of the total time accumulated on the #2 spindle (about 9,300 flight hours).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBefore the accident, the spindle was not a life-limited part, and there were no recurrent inspections specified for the spindle threads, resulting in a low likelihood of the operator detecting the fatigue fracture within the spindle threads before the accident. Following this accident, the manufacturer released a service directive bulletin and the Federal Aviation Administration released an airworthiness directive that require a magnetic particle inspection of spindles with 1,500 hours or more time in service.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn January 26, 2015, about 1202 mountain standard time (MST), an Enstrom 280FX, N86235, was destroyed when it impacted terrain during final approach for landing at Erie Municipal Airport (EIK), Erie, Colorado. Both the instructor pilot and student pilot were fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to New Course Aviation Company and operated by Mountain One Helicopters as a 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 instructional flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight, which operated without a flight plan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a witness interview, the helicopter was on final approach to land on the runway at what seemed like a steep angle of descent. As the helicopter descended, she heard a loud \"pop.\" After the pop, the helicopter began to rotate and then the main rotor (MR) blades separated from the top of the helicopter. The remainder of the helicopter descended to ground impact and then \"exploded.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll three MR blades were found during the on-scene investigation and were identified as blades #1 through #3. The #2 MR blade was found separated from the MR head, which still contained MR blades #1 and #3. Post accident examination revealed that the #2 MR blade had separated due to a fractured spindle. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter, an Enstrom 280FX, was a three-seat, single-engine helicopter (serial number 2002) manufactured in 1985. The three-bladed MR system was powered by a turbo-charged Lycoming HIO-360-F1AD engine rated at 225 horsepower at 3050 rpm. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe inboard end of each main rotor blade is attached to its respective grip and drag link.  Each rotor blade is attached to the outboard side of its respective grip via a retention bolt. At the inboard side of each grip, a pitch arm and drag link are attached to the leading and trailing sides, respectively, of the grip. Two feather bearings, which accommodate rotor blade pitch change motion, a bearing spacer, and a spindle are installed within the grip. A Lamiflex bearing, a spindle retention nut, and a cover are installed at the threaded outboard end of the spindle. Two flanges at the inboard end of the spindle attach to a universal block, the latter of which is attached to the main rotor hub, that accommodate rotor blade flapping and lead-lag motions. See figure 1.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Enstrom spindle and grip assembly&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the maintenance records, the most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on March 17, 2014, at an airframe total time of 9,167 hours. During this annual inspection, all three Lamiflex bearings were replaced. Additionally, all three MR grip assemblies were removed to \"purge and clean\" the flapping hinge bearings, then were reassembled and preloaded per the Enstrom Maintenance Manual. Lastly, the leading-edge tape was replaced on one of the MR blades; the helicopter was then flight tested and subsequently adjusted for proper track and balance. No other maintenance to the MR grips or blades was performed during this inspection or at any other time between the inspection and the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the maintenance records, the #2 spindle, part number (P/N) 28-14282-13, serial number (S/N) 03-014-84N, had not been replaced since the helicopter's manufacture. At the time of the accident, the spindles were not life limited, and there were no recurrent inspections specified for the spindle threads. According to the Enstrom Maintenance Manual, the Lamiflex bearings required replacement every 5 years.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the MR is assembled, the spindle threads reside under the retention nut retaining the Lamiflex bearing. The retention nut must be removed in order to examine the entire threaded region of the spindle for damage. It is unknown whether a thread crack, once grown to a sufficient depth, would produce an out-of-track MR blade. Examination of the maintenance records for the accident helicopter revealed at least 9 instances, from the time the helicopter was manufactured, of Lamiflex bearing replacement for the #2 spindle. (The Enstrom Maintenance Manual the Enstrom Maintenance manual requires the lamiflex bearing to be replaced every 5 years.) However, there was no pattern in the Lamiflex bearing replacement intervals or interrelated note of the helicopter's MR track and balance or the helicopter's flying characteristics.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring manufacture, the cotter pin hole in the spindle is match-drilled with the spindle retention nut installed. There is no specific requirement on the dimension for the cotter pin hole in the engineering drawing to break the sharp edges or chamfer the edges at the cotter pin hole after it is match-drilled. Breaking or chamfering the sharp edges is typically used to reduce stress concentrations that may arise from the matched-drill process.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 1155 weather observation at EIK reported no wind, visibility 10 miles, clear skies, temperature 09ºCelsius (C), dew point 11ºC; barometric altimeter setting 30.18 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRPORT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEIK is a publicly-owned airport without an air traffic control tower. The airport was equipped with one runway designated as runway 15/33. Runway 15/33 was a 4,700-ft-long by 60-ft-wide runway and was reported as \"in good condition.\" The elevation of the threshold of runway 15 was about 5,076 ft above mean sea level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest upright with the right skid low off the east side of the runway. The main wreckage contained the main fuselage (flight deck, skids, tail boom) and engine. The aircraft wreckage displayed severe damage from a high energy vertical impact and post impact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe MR head (with the #1 and #3 MR blades still attached) and MR gearbox were located about 299 ft from the main wreckage at a heading of 350º. The threaded portion of the spindle and associated retention nut on the #2 blade was missing; however, the inboard portion of the spindle was still attached. The #2 MR blade assembly, including the blade, the grip, the threaded portion of the spindle, the retention nut, and the drag link, was located about 657 ft from the main wreckage at a heading of 263º. The #2 blade did not exhibit any damage or indications of contact with any part of the aircraft. An approximate 18-inch section of the leading edge spar and balance weight for the #1 rotor blade was located about 493 ft from the main wreckage at a heading of approximately 248º. The tail rotor blades were found about 290 ft and 666 ft from the main wreckage, at headings of 276º and 325º, respectively. Several other pieces of wreckage were scattered around the approach end of runway 15. The tail rotor gearbox was not located.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was established in the cabin area from the controls up to the MR gearbox and MR hub. The Hobbs meter located in the center pedestal indicated 9,332.7 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom exhibited a MR blade strike. Examination of the MR gearbox mounts indicated that the gearbox mounts were intact and separation from the airframe occurred at the pylon. The overrunning clutch operated normally.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the wreckage examination at the recovery facility, the #2 MR blade assembly (S/N 3469) was disassembled by removing the blade from the grip and removing the Lamiflex cover. The retention nut was found behind the cover with the fractured threaded end of the spindle still attached to the nut, and the cotter pin installed. Additionally, the Lamiflex bearing and shims were located behind the cover. The Lamiflex bearing (S/N 9383) had a manufacturing date of February 7, 2013.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEST AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMaterials Laboratory Part Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe three sets of spindles, nuts, shims, grips, and Lamiflex bearings from the helicopter's rotor arm assemblies were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC for detailed examination.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n#2 Spindle&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe threaded end of the #2 spindle had separated in-flight and was submitted still assembled inside the mating #2 retention nut. With exception of a small region on the #2 spindle threaded end fracture surface, most of the fracture surface of the #2 spindle was covered in a black-colored substance consistent with degraded grease. Dirt and debris coated the surface of the remaining inboard portion of the #2 spindle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe threaded end of the #2 spindle was disassembled from the mating #2 nut, cleaned, and examined in more detail. About 92% of the fracture surface on the separated #2 spindle was flat, and had beach marks consistent with fatigue cracking. (Beach marks are macroscopic progression marks on the fracture surface of a fatigue crack that indicate successive positions of the advancing crack front.) The separation occurred through the root of the end thread (thread closest inboard), and the fatigue crack emanated from the trailing edge (TE) side of the spindle. Corrosion was visible on the fracture surface of the #2 spindle in the fatigue crack initiation area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe remaining 8% of the fracture surface on the separated #2 spindle was rough and had a shear lip, which was consistent with overload. The shear lip was on the leading-edge side of the spindle, opposite the fatigue crack initiation area on the TE side. This was the same area on the fracture surface that was not covered with black grease. The fracture surface in the area of the shear lip on the #2 spindle fracture surface had features showing microvoid coalescence, which were consistent with overstress. On various portions across the entire fracture surface, shiny areas consistent with mechanical damage were observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe average root radius measurement for the #2 spindle was smaller than what was defined in the thread form profile specified by the Enstrom spindle drawing. The remainder of the thread features conformed to the required thread form profile. For additional details of the thread form profile, see the Materials Lab Factual Report in the docket for this investigation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA cross-section was prepared through the separated #2 spindle threaded end. The hardness of the #2 spindle was within the range specified on the Enstrom spindle drawing. The threads of the #2 spindle were examined in the prepared cross-section. Corners with tight radii were observed in the flat-bottomed thread roots. The threads looked to be cut, rather than rolled, and no decarburization (a process used to reduce the carbon content in metal) or abusive machining was detected. The microstructure of the #2 spindle was tempered martensite and consistent with alloy steel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n#1 and #3 Spindles&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe #1 and #3 spindles were completely covered in red/brown grease; the grease was removed and the threaded ends were further cleaned for detailed examination. The average root radius measurements for the #1 and #3 spindles were smaller than what was defined in the thread form profile specified on the Enstrom spindle drawing. The remainder of the thread form features conformed to the required thread form profile. The threads on the #1 spindle were flat-bottomed and had tight radii in the corners, similar to the threads on the #2 spindle. The threads on the #3 spindle were not flat-bottomed, but the radii were smaller than specified.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe threaded ends of the #1 and #3 spindles were examined using magnetic particle inspection (MPI). Multiple MPI indications were observed in the thread roots of both spindles. There was one very bright linear crack indication in the root of the end thread on the trailing edge (TE) side of the #3 spindle, which was the same location from which the fatigue cracking on the #2 thread initiated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA bright linear crack indication was also observed in the root of one of the threads on the #1 spindle on the TE side. However, this indication was observed in the root between two threads about mid-length down the threaded end and in a thread root adjacent to the cotter pin hole. A portion of the crack indication was visible on the inner diameter of the cotter pin hole. The crack indication extended out of the cotter pin hole towards the top side of the #1 spindle. Additional MPI indications also were observed running parallel along portions of multiple thread roots. The parallel indications were in similar locations to where the spindle #2 had tight radii in the thread corners.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fracture surfaces of the cracks in the threads of the #1 and #3 spindles were flat with features consistent with fatigue cracking. Dark areas were observed on the fracture surface of the #3 spindle, consistent with corrosion products.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo metallurgical issues were observed with the remaining components of the rotor arm assemblies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFinite Element (FE) Modeling&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs a result of the fatigue cracking and fracturing found on the helicopter's spindles, FE modeling was performed to examine local stresses on the spindle. Modeling revealed that there was a possibility that, in addition to a longitudinal centrifugal force, the loading on the threaded portion of the spindle may include lateral forces and bending moments. Two regions of interest were studied: the threaded portion of the spindle where the #2 spindle separated due to a fatigue crack that propagated and the cotter pin hole region where cracks were found in the #1 spindle. In November 2015, Enstrom instrumented the MR spindles of an exemplar helicopter with strain gauges to determine whether there was existence of bending loads at spindle threads. These tests revealed that a bending moment existed that increased the stresses in the threaded area of the spindle with a bending moment that was not previously accounted for during the spindle design.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSpindle 2-D Model&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe measured #2 spindle profile was used to construct the FE model of the accident spindle. The corner radii were chosen to be 0.003 inch for all thread roots. A model of a spindle with specified larger 0.009\" thread profile was also constructed for comparison purpose. The 2-D models with these two profiles will be referred to as the \"measured\" model and the \"nominal\" model. The geometry of the nut was approximated from design drawings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe only external load considered for the 2-D model was the axial centrifugal force due to blade rotation. According to Enstrom, during the design of the spindle it was assumed that this was the most significant load acting on the threaded portion of the spindle. The magnitude of the force was chosen to be 21,460 lbs, which, according to design calculations, corresponded to the maximum force allowed at a rotation speed of 385 rpm. This force was applied as a pressure to the nut surface contacting the Lamiflex bearing (which was not included in this model). This surface was constrained to remain horizontal during the simulation, which is an assumption that was intended to account for the stiffness of the Lamiflex bearing. The Lamiflex bearing is stiff, it is not rigid as discussed later in this report. This assumption resulted in a nonuniform pressure distribution on the loading surface.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe longitudinal normal stress was the dominating stress component of the analyses and was the primary quantity of interest. With the measured thread profile, the peak stress occurred in the root region of the first tooth from the bottom, which coincided with the location of the crack that caused the failure of the #2 spindle. With the specified thread profile, stress values were the highest in two regions: the first tooth root and the stress relief feature beneath the threads. The peak stress magnitudes were 149 ksi and 84 ksi for the measured and nominal thread profiles, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRetention Assembly 3-D Model&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the investigation, it was determined that there was a possibility that in addition to the longitudinal centrifugal force, the loading on the threaded portion of the spindle may include lateral forces and bending moments. A 3-D model of the entire retention assembly was built to compute the loads to be applied to the detailed local 3-D FE models of the threaded portion of the spindle. The global 3-D FE model consisted of the flapping pin, the blade grip, the spindle, the two bearings inside the grip, the Lamiflex bearing, and the nut.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forces and moments obtained from the global analysis were applied to the local model as external loadings. The loadings were applied in two steps. In the first step, only the axial force was applied. In the second step, the two transverse forces and the two bending moments were applied in addition to the axial force. This was done to study the effect of bending moment and transverse force, which was accomplished by looking at the differences in stress values between the two loading steps.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTo represent the most severe loading scenarios, 4 cases were developed to analyze the 'worst case' loading scenarios. These cases used the measured thread profile and the nominal thread profile with a stiff Lamiflex bearing. In the first model case where longitudinal (axial) normal stresses were applied in the threaded region, the stress level in the first thread was doubled in the measured thread versus the nominal thread. In the second model case where the longitudinal (axial) normal stresses were applied to the measured thread profile with and without bending moments, the elastic stresses at the first thread increased about 14% with a bending moment. In the third model case where the longitudinal (axial) normal stresses were applied to the nominal thread profile with and without bending moments, the elastic stresses at the first thread similarly increased about 14% with a bending moment. Lastly, in the fourth model case where longitudinal (axial) normal stresses were applied in the measured threaded profile with a stiff Lamiflex bearing versus a soft Lamiflex bearing, the elastic stresses at the first thread increased about 15% with a stiff bearing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCotter Pin 3-D Model&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe #1 spindle of the accident helicopter revealed cracking at the cotter pin hole. Additionally, inspection reports received after issuance of an emergency airworthiness directive (details below) to perform a magnetic particle inspection of the spindle threads revealed about 20% of inspected spindles showed evidence of a crack at the cotter pin hole. Because of this cracking detected on spindles in the area of the cotter pin hole, a new FE model was developed to determine if in-flight loading could have caused high stresses near the cotter pin hole that in turn induced the cracking. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPeak stress values occurred in the first thread root, while no high stresses were observed near the cotter pin hole or in the pin. It was determined that the cotter pin was not significantly loaded, and not related to the inboard cracks. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nComputed Tomography (CT) Scans&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCT scans of the #1 and #3 spindles were completed by an independent laboratory under the direction of an NTSB investigator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe results of the CT scans showed that both the #1 and #3 spindles had indications of cracking. These crack indications were extremely faint, consistent with cracks that were very narrow. Some of the crack indications were in spindle areas where magnetic particle inspections had indicated that cracks were present. However, some of the crack indications were in areas where no cracks were indicated in the magnetic particle inspections. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt could not be determined why the CT crack indications appeared in areas where no magnetic particle inspection crack indications appeared. The CT crack indications could be erroneous, caused by random noise in the images, or the cracks noted in the CT indications could be of such small dimensions that they did not create an indication during the magnetic particle inspection. Because of this uncertainty, none of the crack indications provided any information on the formation process for the cracks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 11, 2015, Enstrom Helicopter Corporation (Enstrom) issued Service Directive Bulletin (SDB) No. 0119, that required an MPI for MR spindles, P/N 28-14282-11 and 28-14282-13, that were in service more than 5,000 hours. The bulletin specified that the MPI should be completed within the next 5 hours of time-in-service (TIS). For MR spindles with less than 5,000 hours TIS, the spindle should be removed and sent to Enstrom for MPI at or before 5,000 hours TIS. The SDB also specified a repetitive MPI conducted every 300 hours after the initial 5,000 hour TIS.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 12, 2015, the FAA issued Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD) 2015-04-51 requiring that any spindle with 5,000 hours or more TIS, or where the hours TIS of the spindle was not known, have an MPI before further flight to determine if a crack exists. If a crack in the spindle was found, replace the spindle before further flight. Results of the MPI testing for all spindles meeting the requirement were to be reported to the FAA.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased in the findings of the MPI tests conducted after the issuance of Enstrom's initial SDB, a revised SDB (Revision 1) was issued by Enstrom on April 1, 2015. The revision reduced the TIS before MPI was required from 5,000 hours to 3,500 hours. On June 1, 2015, Enstrom issued Revision 2 to the SDB further reducing the TIS before MPI was required from 3,500 hours to 1,500 hours. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn April 10, 2015, the FAA superseded EAD 2015-04-51 with EAD 2015-08-51 which advised that, based on inspection reports received by the FAA, about 20% of the spindles that were MPI tested had evidence of cracks. As such, the FAA expanded the applicability of spindles requiring testing to those with 1,500 or more hours TIS.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn August 2015, Enstrom conducted a flight strain survey to characterize the loads placed on the P/N 28-14282-13 spindles during normal and abnormal flight conditions to determine whether there was existence of bending loads at the spindle threads. The strain surveys revealed bending moments that were not accounted for in the original spindle analysis.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, Enstrom performed a crack growth analysis to evaluate cracks about the cotter pin hole.  At the time of the analysis, less than 6% of the overall spindles returned from the field exhibited cracks in the cotter pin hole (much less than the approximately 20% recorded when the FAA EAD 2015-04-51 was first released).  Other than two spindles from the accident aircraft, no additional spindles were found to exhibit cracks about the inboard threaded region of the spindle.  As a result of the analysis, on  June 24, 2016, Enstrom issued Revision 3 to the SDB. This revision modified the original 300-hour repetitive MPI requirement to a 500-hour interval repetitive MPI after the initial MPI at 1,500 hours TIS. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Register, dated March 2, 2017, announced a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to issue an airworthiness directive (AD) for Enstrom MR spindles (P/N 28-14282-11 or 28-14282-13) to establish a life limit of 1,500 hours TIS and require a recurring inspection interval of 500 hours until the spindle reaches its new life limit of 1,500 hours TIS. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was conducting a personal flight in the experimental, amateur-built helicopter. Several witnesses reported seeing the helicopter flying overhead. They reported that it appeared to by flying normally but that it then turned sideways, banked left, and descended to the ground. One witness reported hearing a breaking sound and then seeing the \"back rotor\" hanging from the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe horizontal stabilizer was found separated from the tailboom. Postaccident examination revealed that the horizontal stabilizer spar tube had fractured at the weld area just outboard of the mounting flange. Examinations of the fracture surfaces revealed features consistent with fatigue cracking that had initiated at multiple origins along the weld toe. Although no weld defects or corrosion were noted at the fatigue origins, large areas of both fracture faces were covered by red and brown corrosion products, indicating that the cracks were present and exposed for a considerable amount of time (at least many days but more likely many weeks).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  The fatigue origins were located on the aft surface of the spar and propagated generally forward. The origin location and direction of propagation were indicative of cyclic bending loads in the spar as if the tip of the stabilizer repetitively moved forward relative to the mount. The source of the cyclic bending loads was not clear but could have been the result of many different helicopter factors. These factors could have been unique to the accident helicopter or could be present on all similar helicopters. It is likely that the horizontal stabilizer separated in flight due to undetected fatigue cracking in the stabilizer spar, which resulted in the uncontrolled descent. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs assembled, the fracture location and weld were partially hidden by the horizontal stabilizer's airfoil skin and not directly visible, which would have made any cracking difficult to see. Following the accident, the kit manufacturer issued a mandatory inspection and modification bulletin for the horizontal stabilizer, which detailed inspection criteria and spar replacement guidance if cracking was found.",
    "FactualNarrative": "As a result of the fatigue cracking of the horizontal stabilizer spar found during this investigation, Safari Helicopter issued a mandatory inspection and modification bulletin titled, \"Horizontal Stabilizer Mandatory Inspection and Modification,\" on April 6, 2015. The bulletin specified a liquid penetrant inspection (LPI) of the horizontal stabilizer as follows:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"On helicopters in operation less than 24 months, this inspection should be accomplished at the next annual condition or 100-hour inspection. On helicopters older than 24 months, the inspection should be accomplished before next flight. This inspection should be added to the annual condition inspection for your particular aircraft.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe bulletin stated that, if cracking was found on the horizontal stabilizer spar, it must be replaced with a new spar. If no cracking was found during LPI inspection, Safari indicated that a steel tube insert must be installed into the end of the stabilizer to extend the \"full length of the tail boom mount.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe bulletin also noted that the loss of the horizontal stabilizer \"would change the attitude of the helicopter.\" Given that the stabilizer provides a downward-acting force on the tail section of the helicopter, this attitude change would be experienced by the pilot as an abrupt, uncommanded nose-down pitch. - The helicopter was constructed from a kit produced by Safari Helicopter. It was a two-seat, skid-equipped helicopter with two composite main rotor blades that rotated clockwise and a tail rotor for anti-torque control. The helicopter was equipped with an Aero Sport O-360 engine. Components such as the main rotor head and the tail rotor would typically be delivered to the customer fully assembled.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter, serial number CH2181, was built by the owner of Safari Helicopters on March 1, 2010. A special airworthiness certificate for the helicopter was issued by the FAA on March 6, 2010. The helicopter was sold about 5 days later to a private individual who owned the helicopter until the accident pilot purchased it on November 6, 2014. - On January 16, 2015, about 1230 central standard time, an experimental, amateur-built Safari 400 helicopter, N416JB, impacted terrain following a loss of control in The Woodlands, Texas. The commercial pilot was fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and no flight plan was filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses reported that the helicopter was flying in a south-west direction over the property of Woodland Church. The helicopter appeared normal as it neared the church, then the helicopter \"turned sideways,\" banked to the left, and descended to the ground. One witness stated that he heard a breaking sound and saw the \"back rotor\" hanging. - An autopsy of the pilot was conducted under the authority of Montgomery County Forensic Services, Conroe, Texas. The cause of death for the pilot was attributed to \"multiple blunt injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology testing for the pilot.  The pilot's toxicology results were negative for carbon monoxide and alcohol. The medications colchicine, doxazosin, and valsartan were detected.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported use of doxasozin and valsartan on his most recent FAA medical examination. Both of these prescription medications are used to treat high blood pressure and are not considered to pose a hazard to flight safety. The prescription medication colchicine, which is used to prevent and/or relieve the pain from gout attacks in adults, was not reported previously to the FAA. Some possible side effects of colchicine include nausea, diarrhea, stomach cramps, and weakness. - At 1153, the George Bush Intercontinental Airport (KIAH) automated surface reporting system, located 17 miles southeast of the accident site, reported the following weather conditions: calm winds, 10 miles visibility, ceiling broken at 2,500 ft, temperature 8ºC, dew point 3ºC, and altimeter 30.93 inches of mercury. - The pilot, age 51, held a commercial pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land and instrument ratings. He held a second-class airman medical certificate that was issued on April 23, 2014, with the limitation that he must wear corrective lenses. On the application for this medical certification, the pilot reported that he had accumulated 2,300 total flight hours of which 150 hours were in the previous 6 months.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's logbook, he had accumulated a total of 48.5 hours total helicopter time at the time of the accident. The pilot began his helicopter training in a Schweizer 269C on September 28, 2014. He accumulated a total of 24.0 hours (including 2.5 hours of solo time) in the Schweizer before transitioning to the accident helicopter on December 18, 2014. He had accumulated 25.7 hours total time (including 11 hours of solo time) in the Safari at the time of the accident. - Horizontal Stabilizer&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe horizontal stabilizer and the tail rotor cross and sleeve assembly were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, DC, for further examination. The phenolic sleeve on the tail rotor cross was fractured at the end flange. Examination of the flange fracture revealed a brittle overstress separation with no indications of discontinuities.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe spar tube of the horizontal stabilizer was fractured just outboard of the mounting flange and adjacent to the inboard edge of the airfoil section. The forward side of the end plate was bent slightly outboard but no impact damage was apparent on either the end plate or the airfoil skin of the stabilizer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1: Photograph of fractured spar tube from horizontal stabilizer  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs manufactured, the mounting flange of the spar is welded (on the outboard side) to the spar tube and positioned immediately adjacent to the inboard edge of the airfoil skin. As assembled, the fracture location and weld are partially hidden by the airfoil skin and not directly visible.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMost of the fracture followed the outboard edge of the mounting flange weld. As initially received, large areas of both fracture faces were obscured by red and brown corrosion products. These surfaces were cleaned for a more detailed examination. Magnified optical examinations of the fracture surfaces identified features consistent with fatigue cracking. Three fatigue origins were found on the outer surface of the spar tube at the outboard toe (edge) of the assembly weld. The fatigue propagated generally radially through the wall thickness with some circumferential spreading. The fatigue cracking progressed through about half of the total spar cross section. The fatigue origins and propagation were all on the aft portion of the spar. No corrosion or other obvious damage was apparent at any of the origins.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExaminations also uncovered a rust-covered crack slightly inboard of and undercutting the main fracture plain. The undercutting crack intersected the outboard fatigue and formed part of the overall fracture. Magnified examinations of the crack faces without opening revealed fatigue features with at least one fatigue origin on the outer surface of the spar. The crack morphology was consistent with additional fatigue origins in the unopened portion of the crack.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe remaining fracture surface displayed separation features and deformation patterns consistent with overstress separation. The deformation pattern was consistent with forces associated with the stabilizer tip moving forward and outboard.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVisually, the weld exhibited good workmanship with no apparent undercutting, weld cracking, or surface discontinuities. A small pore and a single area of lack of fusion were uncovered by the weld fracturing in the overstress regions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe inboard fracture face was viewed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) after it was cleaned and the corrosion removed. The fracture area near one fatigue origin point displayed a corrosion-damaged surface, while fracture two other surfaces were much less damaged by corrosion and displayed features consistent with fatigue cracking in alloy steels.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEnergy dispersive x-ray spectra of the spar material acquired during SEM examinations were typical of an AISI2 4100 series alloy steel as indicated on the stabilizer engineering drawing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIgnition System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExaminations of the LSE Plasma III CD Ignition Module (S/N: 43546), the Hall Effect Module (S/N: 1440), and the ignition coils (P/N: 356120) were conducted on March 31, 2015, at the facilities of Light Speed Engineering in Santa Paula, California, with NTSB oversight. No evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction was noted during the examinations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHandheld GPS Device&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Garmin GPSMAP 296 hand-held GPS device was retrieved from the accident site and sent to the NTSB Recorders Laboratory for examination. No tracklog information was present on the device after download using the manufacturer procedures. - The NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) did not travel to the accident scene. According to photographs taken by the FAA on-site, the main wreckage consisting of the fuselage, main rotor, tail and tail rotor came to rest at the fenceline of a treed area. The horizontal stabilizer had separated from the tail boom and was found about 65 feet northeast of the fuselage. The right door frame was found about 85 feet northeast of the fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter wreckage was examined at the facilities of Air Salvage of Dallas on February 24-25, 2015, under the supervision of the NTSB IIC. The examination revealed that the horizontal stabilizer's spar (a steel tube) had separated at the weld area just outboard of a round steel plate (the stabilizer mounting flange) that was welded to the spar.  The fracture exhibited signatures of corrosion and fatigue at the weld line. The inboard portion of the spar remained bolted to the tail boom at the mounting flange. Paint transfers were observed on one tail rotor blade. These transfers were located on the side of the blade where the horizontal stabilizer would be mounted. Additionally, both tail rotor blades exhibited impact damage on the leading and trailing edges of the blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was established from the cockpit flight controls through the tail rotor system. The control pedal cable leading from the tail rotor assembly to the right control pedal was found in the full right control pedal position. (In this helicopter, the right pedal is used to counter the torque of the main rotor.) The stationary swash plate (controlling right/left, fore, and aft cyclic) was fractured and separated at all three push-pull tubes. The right door upper and lower hinges were intact, and the upper and lower latching points appeared normal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe governor friction clutch was found loose. The friction clutch was found to rotate freely and was characterized by a Safari Helicopter representative as slightly loose. According to the Safari Helicopter representative, an excessively loose friction clutch could prevent effective throttle manipulation by the governor, and an overly tight friction clutch could prevent the pilot from over-riding the governor. An instructor pilot for Safari who had recently flown with the accident pilot in the accident helicopter stated that the governor appeared to operate properly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine continuity was confirmed by turning the crankshaft to establish compression at all four cylinders. The four top and four bottom spark plugs were removed from the engine. All eight spark plugs appeared unremarkable. The magneto was turned by hand and sparked at all four connection wires.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor was in the full throttle position. Blue colored fuel (consistent in appearance with 100 low-lead aviation fuel) was found in the carburetor. The gascolator and carburetor fuel filter screens were void of contaminants. The air filter was examined and appeared unremarkable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain Rotor System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main transmission pinion, tail rotor output shaft, and clutch assembly were separated from the main transmission and free of their mountings. The bottom of the clutch assembly showed evidence of a rotational impact of the clutch drive plate on one of the six clutch drum mount bolts consistent with rotation at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth composite main rotor blades were deformed upward. One main rotor blade was broken through the laminate and spar about 2 feet outboard of the grip; however, the brass rod along the leading edge was intact but severely deformed. Both main rotor blades exhibited impact marks along the outboard 3 to 4 feet of the leading edges. The main rotor blades rotated normally about the feathering axis when rotated by hand at the grips.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe shear line from the transmission to the main rotor shaft was intact consistent with movement of the gears of the main shaft. The drive gear was still coupled to the shaft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTail Section&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImpact marks on the tail structure and tail rotor drive shaft were observed. The damage was consistent with a right to left main rotor strike, when looking forward.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor drive shaft was impacted at 14.5 inches aft of the forward edge of the fifth bearing frame. The fractured end of the tail was near the forward end of the tail boom. The sixth bearing, along with the tail rotor input coupling and the aft end of the drive shaft (about 24 inches) were missing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor output from the main transmission spun freely; however, the bearings did not rotate smoothly. The tail rotor pitch arms were fastened in their grips. The tail rotor pitch links were deformed and still attached.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight Deck Observations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ignition switch was found in the right (\"R\") position. A test of the magneto switch and the ignition module pin (#1) indicted the electronic ignition was open, and the magneto was grounded. Only the electronic ignition would have been operating at this switch setting.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter had warning indicator bulbs for the main rotor, tail rotor, governor, fuel low, and low oil pressure; examination of all five bulbs revealed that none exhibited the typical filament stretching found when a bulb is lit at impact. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The student helicopter pilot was on a solo training flight in the airport traffic pattern. He had completed eight approaches via a right downwind approach to the runway, when the air traffic controller advised him that he was number three for his next approach. About 1 minute later, the student pilot requested a left 360-degree turn. The controller then instructed him to hold at his current location and expect to be number four in sequence. During the next 6 minutes, the controller made three attempts to have the student pilot report the traffic to follow on final approach in sight, and the student pilot advised that it was hard for him to hear the controller's instructions due to wind noise. The controller then advised the student pilot to follow an airplane on short final approach, and the student pilot reported the traffic in sight. About 1 minute later, the controller advised the pilot of another airplane to follow the helicopter on the approach. The airplane pilot observed the helicopter ascend in a series of right, 360-degree turns for about 100 to 200 ft. As it climbed, white smoke consistent with a rapid increase in engine rpm and an engine overspeed trailed the helicopter. When the helicopter climbed to an apex of about 800 ft, the ends of both rotor blades coned upward to where the tips were nearly vertical, consistent with a low rotor rpm condition. The helicopter then entered a right, spiraling descent until it impacted the water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation. The main rotor blade elastomeric teeter stops were missing, consistent with low rotor rpm blade flapping. Although the temperature and dew point were conducive to carburetor icing, its formulation likely would not have allowed the helicopter to climb as high as it did just before the accident. More likely, the student pilot became distracted while he attempted to track other aircraft in the traffic pattern and sequence the helicopter for the approach, which led to his failure to maintain rotor rpm. Toxicological  testing performed on specimens from the pilot identified butalbital in liver (1.24 ug/g) and in muscle (0.468 ug/g). Estimated corresponding blood levels were likely below the therapeutic window for butalbital, and  unlikely to have been directly impairing at the time of the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "RHC Safety Notice 24: LOW RPM ROTOR STALL CAN BE FATAL&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExcerpts include:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"Rotor stall due to low RPM causes a very high percentage of helicopter accidents, both fatal and non-fatal. [It] can occur at any airspeed and when it does, the rotor stops producing the lift required to support the helicopter and the aircraft literally falls out of the sky.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotor stall is very similar to the stall of an airplane wing at low airspeeds. As the airspeed of an airplane gets lower, the nose-up angle, or angle-of-attack, of the wing must be higher for the wing to produce the lift required to support the weight of the airplane. At a critical angle (about 15 degrees), the airflow over the wing will separate and stall, causing a sudden loss of lift and a very large increase in drag.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane pilot recovers by lowering the nose of the airplane to reduce the wing angle-of-attack below stall and adds power to recover the lost airspeed. The same thing happens during rotor stall with a helicopter except it occurs due to low rotor RPM instead of low airspeed. As the RPM of the rotor gets lower, the angle-of-attack of the rotor blades must be higher to generate the lift required to support the weight of the helicopter. Even if the collective is not raised by the pilot to provide the higher blade angle, the helicopter will start to descend until the upward movement of air to the rotor provides the necessary increase in blade angle-of-attack.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs with the airplane wing, the blade airfoil will stall at a critical angle, resulting in a sudden loss of lift and a large increase in drag. The increased drag on the blades acts like a huge rotor brake causing the rotor RPM to rapidly decrease, further increasing the rotor stall. As the helicopter begins to fall, the upward rushing air continues to increase the angle-of-attack on the slowly rotating blades, making recovery virtually impossible, even with full down collective.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the rotor stalls, it does not do so symmetrically because any forward airspeed of the helicopter will produce a higher airflow on the advancing blade than on the retreating blade.\" - The helicopter was powered by a derated Lycoming O-320 series engine driving a two-blade rotor system. The latest 100-hour inspection was completed on December 21, 2014, at a Hobbs time of 2,735.7 hours. Engine total time at that time was 3,965.2 hours, 1,765.2 hours since overhaul.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA company log, that listed each flight, indicated that as of January 9, 2015, the Hobbs meter indicated 2,745.4 hours. At the time of the accident, the Hobbs meter indicated 2,746.3.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter had an engine rpm governor. According to the Pilot's Operating Handbook, \"the governor maintains engine RPM by sensing changes and applying corrective throttle inputs through a friction clutch which can be easily overridden by the pilot. The governor is active only above 80% engine RPM and can be switched on or off using the toggle switch on the end of the right seat collective. The governor is designed to assist in controlling RPM under normal conditions. It may not prevent over- or under-speed conditions generated by aggressive flight maneuvers.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a Robinson Helicopter Company representative, a rapid increase in engine rpm along with a slight overspeed can create white smoke out the exhaust, especially in a higher time engine. This requires the pilot to override (or turn off) the governor.\" Also, \"a rapid increase in engine RPM along with raising the collective will result in a nose right yaw and a quick ascent.\" - On January 10, 2015, at 1032 Atlantic standard time, a Robinson R-22 Beta, N348VH, operated by Vertical Solutions Helicopter Company, LLC, was destroyed when it impacted waters of San Juan Bay, off shore Cataño, Puerto Rico. The student pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed for the local flight that originated at Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport (TJIG), Isla Grande, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The solo instructional flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the student pilot's flight instructor, the student pilot arrived at the hangar about 0800 and began his preflight inspection of the helicopter. Upon completion of the inspection, they spoke for about 20 minutes about the weather conditions at the airport, whether he had all of his documents on him, how long he would fly and what he would be practicing on the flight. They then wheeled the helicopter outside and the student pilot made final preparations for the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 0845, the student pilot started the helicopter and about 10 minutes later shut it down and walked to the hanger. He explained that the tower controller had said that his request to make right closed traffic patterns could not be accommodated at that time and to try again later. About 0920, the flight instructor phoned the tower to see if the flight could go and got an affirmative response, so he sent the student pilot back out to continue the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter departed the ramp about 0930 and remained in the traffic pattern for approximately 1 hour. As the flight instructor was sitting in the hangar, he noticed that it was taking longer than normal since he had heard the helicopter go by. He stepped outside and visually located the helicopter in a left holding pattern south of the airport, which was standard procedure when the tower needed sequencing for other aircraft, then he went back inside. A few minutes later, the flight instructor still had not heard the helicopter, so he went outside again, but was unable to locate the helicopter. He then noticed a ports authority vehicle driving towards the police hangar, and about 1 minute  later, he observed one of the police helicopters starting. At that moment, the flight instructor suspected a problem. He then called the control tower controller, who told him that he had seen the helicopter spinning and that it impacted the water by Cataño Point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a pilot of a low-wing airplane that was  approaching the airport, about 3 to 4 miles on a straight-in approach to runway 9, with the helicopter number two to land. The tower controller asked the pilot if he had the helicopter in sight, after which, the pilot saw an aircraft about ½ mile ahead, about the 2:30 positon (off the right side) of his airplane. The pilot originally thought he saw a radio-controlled (RC) helicopter, because it was emitting white smoke from the back, as did the RC helicopters he was used to flying. He then saw it make a series of right 360-degree turns \"around the rotor head,\" with the fuselage vertical, and realized it was a helicopter. While turning to the right, the helicopter climbed 100 to 200 feet, reaching an estimated 800 feet. As it did, the ends of both rotor blades coned upwards to where the blades tips were vertical, with the major bending occurring about ¼ blade span from the ends of the blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe witness then saw the helicopter's nose drop; it then entered a descent, and spiraled downward to the right three or four times until it impacted the water. It hit the water heading east, nose and right side down. Upon impact, the tailboom separated from the airframe toward the west.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe witness also recalled that the white smoke he originally saw during the climb emanated from the back of the helicopter to a distance of about 1 ½ tailboom-lengths aft of the boom, and that it dissipated once the helicopter began its descent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a police detective, a witness on the ground in Cataño also saw white smoke emanating from the back of the helicopter. However, instead of the helicopter turning, he saw it swinging from side to side like a pendulum as it descended.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness who was interviewed by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector reported that he heard the engine shut down twice, and after the second time it shut down, the helicopter descended into the water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRadar data was received from the FAA; however, it was insufficient to construct  an accurate plot of the helicopter's positions and altitudes prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRadio transmissions, as noted in the FAA air traffic control Aircraft Accident Package, included:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0948, the pilot advised ready for takeoff. The local (tower) controller issued the wind and a takeoff clearance, which the pilot acknowledged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0951, the pilot reported south of the tower and the controller issued the wind and a clearance for the option. The helicopter subsequently completed a series of eight approaches via right downwind to runway 9 through 1023.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1024, the pilot reported south of the tower. The controller issued the wind, an option clearance, and instructions to be number three following a Cessna Caravan on final approach. The pilot advised that he was looking for traffic.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1025, the pilot requested a left three-sixty [turn] on the right downwind. The controller instructed the pilot to hold south at his current location and expect to be number four in sequence, which the pilot acknowledged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1031, the controller made three attempts to have the pilot report traffic to follow on final approach in sight. The pilot advised it was hard to hear due to wind. The controller then instructed the pilot to follow a Cessna on short final, and issued the wind and a clearance for the option. The pilot reported traffic to follow in sight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1032, the controller advised another pilot to expect to follow a helicopter on a right base. That pilot reported the helicopter in sight and later that he saw the helicopter go down in the Cataño area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no further transmissions from the helicopter. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot at El Instituto de Ciencias Forenses de Puerto Rico, San Juan Puerto, where the cause of death was determined to be \"severe body trauma.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing was performed by the FAA Forensic Toxicology Research team, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Results noted no ethanol, but did find 1.24 (ug/ml, ug/g) of butalbital detected in the liver, 0.468 (ug/ml, ug/g) of butalbital detected in muscle, and losartan detected in the liver.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Aerospace Medical Research web site, butalbital is a short- to intermediate-acting barbiturate. It is commonly used in combination with other drugs such as acetaminophen and caffeine to treat mild to moderate pain, migraines and tension headaches. Losartan is used in the treatment of hypertension. - Weather, recorded at TJIG at 1045, included scattered clouds at 2,500 feet, wind from 100 degrees true at 12 knots, temperature 27 degrees C, dew point 22 degrees C, altimeter setting 30.16 inches of Mercury.&#x0D;\nFor the ambient temperature and dew point, a carburetor icing probability chart found in FAA Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin CE-09-35 indicated \"serious icing [at] glide power.\" - The student pilot, age 59, held an FAA third-class medical certificate dated October 2, 2014. As of his latest logged flight, on January 9, 2015, the pilot indicated 91.7 hours of total flight time. - The helicopter was recovered from San Juan Bay in the vicinity of 18 degrees, 26.53 minutes north latitude, 66 degrees, 07.16 minutes west longitude. The tailboom was initially not recovered.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was subsequently taken to a secure facility where it was examined. Cabin crush patterns were consistent with a nose-down, right-side-down water entry. The doors were not installed for the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument console was found separated from the lower console, but tethered by wires. All five flight instruments had water inside of them. The keyed ignition switch was in the \"Both\" position and the rotor RPM gage indicated 76%. Other instrument indications moved as the wreckage was moved. The clutch switch was in the \"Engaged\" position, and the \"Master Battery\" and \"Alternator\" switches were in the \"On\" position.&#x0D;\nThe cyclic was found jammed in the neutral position with the friction off. The collective was jammed about two-thirds of the way up with the friction off. The left tail rotor control pedal was jammed forward and the right tail rotor control pedal was jammed aft. The removable controls (in case a second pilot was onboard) were found stowed under the left seat.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel mixture knob was jammed in the \"Full Rich\" position, and the throttle grip was jammed in the \"Idle\" position. The carburetor heat control was jammed .20 inches up from full down (heat off) position. The carburetor heat control wire sheathing was stretched, and the mounting bracket was separated from the air box. The carburetor heat sliding door was deformed and jammed open 1.7 inches, or about 70% heat on.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth drive V-belts remained on their sheaves and appeared undamaged. The sprag clutch was operated without any anomalies noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine cooling fan was bent slightly and the upper half of the scroll sustained impact damage. The lower half of the scroll was not recovered. There was a single scuff mark on the edge of the cooling fan inlet adjacent to the scroll lip and several static contact marks on the leading edge of two of the fins. The exhaust system was bent and deformed with the tailpipe up and around the lower sheave and starter ring gear. The alternator cooling fan was deformed on one side, but with no rotational scoring noted. The alternator belt remained in position. The forward face of the upper sheave had a scuff mark adjacent to the lower frame tube. The aft face of the upper sheave had no contact marks. There were no rotational scoring marks noted at any observed contact points.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine did not exhibit any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Approximately 3 gallons of water and oil were drained from the oil sump. The cooling fan was rotated and crankshaft continuity was confirmed with no anomalies noted to the valve train or accessory gears. Thumb compression and suction were observed on all four cylinders. Visual examination of the rocker arms, push rods, valve caps, valve stems, valve springs and lower spark plugs revealed no anomalies. Both magnetos produced spark after internal components were dried.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll oil lines and fittings were secure with no indications of the oil system being compromised. Visual inspection of the oil screen and oil filter element revealed no debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel mixture arm on the carburetor was separated from its shaft and the accelerator pump shaft was slightly bent. Carburetor removal and disassembly revealed no preexisting anomalies. The float bowl was full of liquid consistent in appearance with 100LL aviation fuel and water. The brass floats were undamaged. The gascolator bowl was also full of liquid consistent with 100LL aviation fuel and a small amount of water. Recovery personnel had also noted a fuel-type sheen on the water's surface and an odor of fuel at the crash site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward flex coupling was undamaged, and the intermediate flex coupling was bent and disconnected at the yoke consistent with overload. The main rotor driveshaft was rotated by hand more than 360 degrees with no anomalies noted. Oil was visible in the main rotor gearbox sight gauge.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne main rotor blade was bent slightly upward about 7 feet from the tip, and bent downward and aft slightly about 3 feet from the tip. It had several creases running mostly chordwise from the trailing edge. The trailing edge was bent upward near the tip. There were no visible contact marks on the leading edge. The pitch control bearing rotated smoothly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe other main rotor blade was bowed upward at midspan. There were no visible contact marks on the leading edge although there was a scuff mark on the upper skin near the tip that appeared to be yellow paint. The paint could not be matched to specific point on the helicopter; however, the only yellow paint on it was on the main rotor blades. The pitch control bearing rotated with resistance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth main rotor blade elastomeric teeter stops were missing, consistent with low rpm blade flapping.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 27, 2015, the operator learned that portions of the tail had washed onshore about 2 weeks earlier, and that local police had put them in a storage yard. FAA was then able to take photographs and provide them to the investigation team. Review of the photographs did not reveal any preexisting mechanical anomalies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInstrument warning panel light bulbs were analyzed for filament stretching (bulb illuminated at impact.)  Filament stretching was confirmed by the NTSB Materials Laboratory on three of the six bulbs submitted: the ALT bulb, the GOV OFF bulb and the OIL P bulb. The three that did not have filament stretching were the T/R CHIP bulb, the LOW RPM bulb and LOW FUEL bulb. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter was on a visual flight rules (VFR) repositioning flight in preparation for providing contracted air support capability to the local sheriff's office the next day. The operator reported that the helicopter did not arrive at the intended destination, and the wreckage was located 29 miles north of the intended destination. The helicopter was fragmented into multiple pieces along a 174-ft debris path. Ground scars and wreckage distribution were consistent with collision with terrain while in forward flight. The observations from a weather station located 3 miles east-southeast of the accident site indicated ceilings less than 500 ft and visibility less than 1 mile were likely at the time of the accident. The relative humidity had rapidly increased above 90 percent immediately before the accident, which would be indicative of cloud cover and mist at or near the surface. Witnesses living in the local area reported that the visibility at ground level was very limited, with low clouds and fog. Observations near the destination showed lowered visibility and low ceilings as the rain moved eastward through the accident area. Gusty winds ahead of the lowering ceilings would have likely created low-level wind shear. The operator's flight data monitoring system indicated that the helicopter was flying along an interstate about 300 ft above ground level (agl), which decreased to about 200 ft agl, likely as the visibility was reduced. However, the last recorded points indicated that the helicopter had climbed to about 500 ft agl, and was no longer tracking the interstate. It is likely that the VFR flight encountered instrument meteorological conditions, and the pilot was trying to maneuver to an area with greater visibility when the helicopter collided with terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather information available to the pilot before takeoff showed a cold front between the departure airport and destination, with forecasted low clouds, rain, ceilings below 600 ft, and gusty winds associated with that front. It was the pilot's responsibility to review the weather before all Part 91 flights; the chief pilot was not required to review the conditions with the pilot for such flights. Had the pilot conducted thorough preflight planning, he should have identified the deteriorating weather conditions and recognized that he could not complete the VFR flight.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The five-seat, conventionally configured single engine helicopter, with skid type landing gear, serial number 52004, was manufactured in 1992. It was powered by an Allison 250 C30P 650-shp engine.  A review of the maintenance logbooks documented that the most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on December 31, 2014.  Total aircraft time was 8,116.7 hours.  A main rotor mast nut torque check was due within the next 5 hours. Total engine time was 13,539.4 hours, and 2,030.5 hours since major overhaul. - On December 31, 2014, at 1710 mountain standard time, a Bell 206L-4, N57AW, collided with terrain 7 miles west of Benson, AZ. The commercial pilot and pilot rated mechanic were fatally injured and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to N57AW LLC and operated by Airwest Helicopters under the provision of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a positioning flight.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight which operated on a company visual flight rules flight plan. The flight originated from Glendale, AZ, at 1550 and was destined for Sierra Vista, AZ.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter had been at the Airwest facilities in Glendale undergoing a 100-hour inspection. The inspection was completed immediately prior to the helicopter's departure. The purpose of the flight was to reposition the helicopter to Sierra Vista, where it was contracted to provide air support to the Cochise County Sheriff's Office the next day.  The Chief Pilot stated that he had numerous face to face discussions with the pilot about the maintenance work being done on the helicopter and the weather conditions. Both the accident pilot and Chief Pilot were comfortable with the intended flight to Sierra Vista. An Airwest mechanic accompanied the pilot on the repositioning flight in order to perform the main rotor mast nut torque check after they landed, which was due within the next 5 flight hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that the helicopter had not arrived at its destination and that the Sky Connect Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) system indicated that the helicopter was at a stationary location between Tucson and Benson, Arizona.  The Cochise County Sheriff located the helicopter wreckage about 2030 at the location the Sky Connect system was reporting. The helicopter was fragmented into multiple pieces along a 174 foot long debris path.  Witnesses living in the local area reported hearing a low flying helicopter around the time of the accident, and that the visibility at ground level was very limited, with low clouds and fog.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhile en route, the pilot had established communications with Tucson Approach at 17 miles northwest of Tucson International Airport and received flight following as he transited through the Tucson Class C airspace, following Interstate 10. Radar services were terminated after the helicopter exited the Class C area about 17:03.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a Sky Connect Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) system which reports the helicopters position, heading, direction of flight, altitude, and speed approximately every 2 minutes.  Sky Connect recorded the helicopter departing Glendale to the southeast at 15:50. The track proceeded to follow highway I-10 at an altitude of about 300 feet above ground level (agl). During the last 10 minutes of flight, the track recorded that the helicopter descended to about 200 feet agl while remaining over I-10. The last Sky Connect point was recorded at 17:10, and indicated that the helicopter had climbed to over 500 feet agl and had drifted a half mile south of I-10. The final Sky Connect recorded point was 0.4 miles west of the accident site, and 0.5 miles south of I-10. - The National Weather Service (NWS) Surface Analysis Chart for 1700 MST depicted a cold front that stretched from just south of the accident site southwest across northern Mexico and into the eastern Pacific Ocean. A stationary front stretched from just south of the accident site southeastward into northern and central Mexico. A surface low pressure center with a pressure of 1006-hectopascals (hPa) was located in southeastern Arizona just south of the accident site. Two other surface low pressure centers were located in central and eastern Arizona with pressures of 1008-hPa. The station models around the accident site depicted temperatures in the low 40's to upper 50's Fahrenheit (F), with temperature-dew point spreads of 15° F or more south and east of the accident site and temperature-dew point spreads of 5° F or less west of the accident site, a variable wind between 5 and 20 knots, mostly cloudy skies, and moderate rain west of the accident site. Areas near and ahead of fronts and surface low pressure centers are typically areas where enhanced lift, clouds, and precipitation can occur. The cloudy skies and rainy conditions would have been expected to move from west to east across Arizona with the mid- and upper-level wind pattern.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe area surrounding the accident site was documented utilizing official NWS Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METARs) and Specials (SPECIs). The following observations were taken from standard code and are provided in plain language. AA1OV-2 Benson, Arizona, observation site (AU445) was the closest weather station to the accident site located 3 miles east-southeast of the accident site, at an elevation of 4,250 feet, and its reports were not supplemented.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBenson weather at 1652 was reported as wind from 250° at 8 knots with gusts to 11 knots, temperature of 4° Celsius (C), dew point temperature of 2° C, a relative humidity of 88 percent, and an altimeter setting of 29.86 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBenson weather at 1702 was reported as wind from 243° at 8 knots with gusts to 13 knots, temperature of 3° C, dew point temperature of 2° C, a relative humidity of 90 percent, and an altimeter setting of 29.86 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPioneer Airfield (KALK) was the closest official weather station to the accident site and had an Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) whose reports were not supplemented. Pioneer was located 21 miles south of the accident site at an elevation of 4,767 feet. The following observations were taken and disseminated during the times surrounding the accident:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPioneer weather at 1556 reported as wind from 220° at 21 knots with gusts to 31 knots, 10 miles visibility, clear skies below 12,000 feet above ground level (agl), temperature of 10° C, dew point temperature of -1° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.88 inches of mercury. Remarks: automated station with a precipitation discriminator, peak wind from 230° at 33 knots at 1527, sea level pressure 1006.2 hPa, temperature 10.0° C, dew point temperature -1.1° C, lightning detection system with the sensor not operating.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPioneer weather at 1656 reported as wind from 210° at 14 knots, 10 miles visibility, scattered clouds at 4,200 feet agl, a broken ceiling at 5,000 feet agl, temperature of 9° C, dew point temperature of 1° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.90 inches of mercury. Remarks: automated station with a precipitation discriminator, peak wind from 220° at 31 knots at 1622 MST, sea level pressure 1006.9 hPa, temperature 8.9° C, dew point temperature 0.6° C, 6-hourly maximum temperature of 12.8° C, 6-hourly minimum temperature of 8.9° C, 3-hourly pressure increase of 0.5 hPa, lightning detection system with the sensor not operating.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTucson International Airport (KTUS) is located 6 miles south of Tucson, Arizona, and had an automated surface observation system (ASOS) whose reports were supplemented by air traffic control. Tucson is located 29 miles west-northwest of the accident site, at an elevation of 2,643 feet, and had a 12° easterly magnetic variation. The following observations were taken and disseminated during the times surrounding the accident:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTucson weather at 1648 reported as wind from 010° at 4 knots, 4 miles visibility, light rain, mist, broken ceiling at 600 feet agl, overcast skies at 1,100 feet agl, temperature of 6° C, dew point temperature of 4° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.95 inches of mercury. Remarks: automated station with a precipitation discriminator, one-hourly precipitation of 0.08 inches.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTucson weather at 1653 reported as wind calm, 3 miles visibility, moderate rain, mist, a broken ceiling at 600 feet agl, overcast skies at 1,100 feet agl, temperature of 6° C, dew point temperature of 4° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.95 inches of mercury. Remarks: automated station with a precipitation discriminator, sea level pressure 1013.0 hPa, one-hourly precipitation of 0.08 inches, 6-hourly precipitation of 0.14 inches, temperature 6.1° C, dew point temperature 4.4° C, 6-hourly maximum temperature of 15.6° C, 6-hourly minimum temperature of 6.1° C, 3-hourly pressure increase of 0.5 hPa.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe observations from Benson indicated both ceilings less than 500 feet and visibility less than 1 mile (LIFR – Low IFR) were likely at the time of the accident near the accident site. Benson relative humidities rapidly increased to 79 percent by 1622 and the relative humidities increased above 90 percent by 1702 which would likely be indicative of cloud cover and mist at or near the surface or 4,250 feet msl. Tucson experienced similar conditions to Benson though conditions at Tucson were only IFR with the ceilings below 1,000 feet. Breezy to windy conditions were present ahead of the lowering visibility and ceiling conditions as seen in the Pioneer and Sierra Vista observations, with ceilings lowering at both of those locations as the rain moved eastward across southern Arizona after the accident time. The gusty winds ahead of the lowering ceilings and visibilities would have likely created low-level wind shear (LLWS).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSierra Vista was the closest site with a Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF).  The 1206 Sierra Vista TAF expected wind from 300° at 15 knots with gusts to 25 knots, 7 miles visibility, light rain, a broken ceiling at 2,000 feet agl, occasional light to moderate turbulence in clear air from the surface to 9,000 feet, light rime icing in cloud from 3,000 to 6,000 feet, and minimum altimeter setting of 29.92 inHg starting around 1600 and valid through 1900.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Tucson TAF issued at 1513 was the valid TAF before the approximate 1540 to 1550 takeoff time. The 1513 Tucson TAF expected wind from 320° at 8 knots, greater than 6 miles visibility, light rain, scattered clouds at 600 feet agl, and an overcast ceiling at 1,500 feet agl. Temporary conditions between 1500 and 1900 of 5 miles visibility, light rain, mist, and a broken ceiling at 600 feet agl was forecast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Weather Service Office in Tucson, Arizona, issued an Area Forecast Discussion (AFD) at 1423. The aviation section of the AFD mentioned IFR conditions developing due to lowering ceilings and precipitation from Tucson eastward starting around 1800. The aviation section of the AFD also mentioned the gusty southwest wind ahead of the front with gusts to 35 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"MVFR (marginal VFR) WITH POSSIBLE IFR CONDITIONS DEVELOPING DUE TO LOWERING CEILINGS AND SHOWERS...FIRST AT KTUS/KOLS (Tucson/Nogales) TERMINALS AND THEN AT KDUG (Douglas) AROUND 01/01Z (Dec 31, 1800 MST), . THE HIGHER TERRAIN WILL SEE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN VISIBILITY DUE TO RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS. SOME PARTIAL CLEARING IS THEN EXPECTED FROM WEST TO EAST TOMORROW MORNING. WINDS AHEAD OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL GENERALLY BE OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST AT 15 TO 25 KTS WITH GUSTS NEAR 35 KTS WITH THE HIGHEST WIND SPEEDS IN AND AROUND THE KOLS/KDUG TERMINALS.

The helicopter was fragmented into three sections consisting of the cockpit, cabin and main rotor gear box, the engine, engine deck, and fuel cell, and the tail boom. The debris was oriented on a 173 magnetic degree bearing and extended for 174 feet. The initial point of ground contact was a long ground scar that terminated at a mesquite tree stump with the left landing skid extending from the stump back along the ground scar. There was a less distinct but parallel ground imprint about 12 feet to the west of the landing skid. Surrounding the mesquite tree stump was mesquite branches that had been broken off or chopped. About 12 feet past the stump, on the east side of the bearing line, was a perpendicular 12 foot long ground scar that was consistent in length and form to a rotor blade imprint.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit, cabin, main rotor gearbox, rotor mast and hub, and tail rotor gearbox and tail rotor blades were located 120 feet from the initial point of impact and entangled with the broken trunk and branches of a second mesquite tree. The cockpit had separated from the fuselage. One rotor blade had separated approximately 4 feet outboard of the rotor hub, and the other was cut by recovery personnel about 4 feet outboard of the hub. One separated blade section was measured as 12 feet in length and was located 90 feet to the west of the main rotor hub. The other blade section measured 8 feet in length, and was located in the wreckage under the cabin. The rotor blades exhibited leading edge bending, trailing edge buckling, and chordwise scratches. The tail rotor and gearbox had separated from the tail boom and was located in the main wreckage cabin area. One blade on the tail rotor was missing about half the blade. Both blades exhibited chordwise scratches.  The tail rotor drive shaft remained on the tail boom. Both the forward end of the drive shaft and the tail rotor end of the drive shaft exhibited torsional overload separations. \tControl tubes routed up the vertical control compartment were fractured in multiple locations, however, all hardware connections from servo actuator to flight controls appeared connected prior to impact.  Cockpit flight controls were in place on the right side of the cockpit, the controls had been removed by the operator on left cockpit position. Hydraulic actuators to main rotor system exhibited control continuity. Two pitch change control tubes to main rotor hub were fractured and displayed signatures consistent with overload. All hardware was connected. The pitch change horn on one main rotor blade was fractured at main rotor hub assembly. Pitch change link was located and fracture surface was consistent with impact damage. The main rotor gearbox rotor mast was rotated by hand and the transmission turned freely with no binding or grinding noted. The entire landing gear skid assembly detached from the airframe upon impact, with signatures of a left side low initial impact. Landing skid tubes separated from both cross tubes with the toe of the left skid fracturing forward of the left forward attaching collar.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 54 feet further down range was the engine and fuel cell, entangled in a third mesquite tree. Fuel drained out of the fuel cell when moved. Four of the engine's compressor impeller blades exhibited leading edge tip bending opposite the direction of rotation and dirt adhesion to all blade surfaces. Manual rotation of the compressor resulted in smooth rotation of the compressor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was transported to a maintenance facility and disassembled. Downward crush damage/deformation was evident on the exhaust collector support exhaust stack. Dirt adhesion was evident through the entire gas path. Combustor liner was normal in appearance. Dirt adhesion was noted throughout the combustion section. The N1, N2, and accessory gear drive trains all rotated smoothly. Fuel pump and the fuel control unit were undamaged and fuel was noted between the check valve and the fuel nozzle. Both upper and lower chip removed and found free of material.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators did not find any evidence of mechanical anomaly or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL &amp; PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was performed on the pilot on January 3, 2015, by the Cochise County Sheriff Forensic Pathologist. The opinion of the forensic pathologist was the cause of death was ascribed to multiple blunt force injuries.  The FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute Forensic Toxicology Research Team performed forensic toxicology on the specimens from the pilot with negative results for ethanol and listed drugs.  Screening for carbon monoxide and cyanide were not performed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was performed on the pilot rated passenger on January 3, 2015, by the Cochise County Sheriff Forensic Pathologist. The opinion of the forensic pathologist was the cause of death was ascribed to multiple blunt force injuries.  The FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute Forensic Toxicology Research Team performed forensic toxicology on the specimens from the passenger with negative results for carbon monoxide, cyanide, ethanol and listed drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS &amp; RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Garmin StreetPilot portable GPS was recovered from the helicopter wreckage. It was subsequently sent to the NTSB Vehicle Recorders Laboratory for further examination. The Garmin StreetPilot is a portable GPS designed for automotive use. The display is capable of showing the device position over a variety of mapping options. When enabled, the device is capable of storing track information to non-volatile memory which may be downloaded using manufacturer software. The track information consists of time, latitude, and longitude; altitude is not recorded.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Vehicle Recorder Laboratory performed an exterior examination which revealed the device had sustained significant impact damage. An internal inspection revealed no significant damage to electronic components. The unit was repaired and downloaded using the manufacturer's software.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA graphical overlay of the accident flight was generated using Google Earth and an aviation sectional chart. The recording began at 1648:20, when the helicopter was northwest of Tucson International Airport (TUS). The track followed Interstate Highway I-10 southeast bound, passed Tucson. The recording ended shortly after the helicopter passed Tucson, at 1657:57.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA copy of the recorder's laboratory factual report is located in the public docket for this accident. - Airwest holds a Part 135 Commuter and On Demand Operations certificate.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The purpose of the instructional helicopter flight was to review advanced maneuvers in preparation for the student pilot's upcoming stage check. The student stated that he and the flight instructor had conducted 3 approaches and landings before initiating a practice autorotation. He stated that as the helicopter descended through 100 ft in the autorotation, the instructor applied throttle in an attempt to recover, but the engine did not respond. A witness stated that, about halfway through the helicopter's autorotative descent, it appeared to momentarily level off before abruptly entering a nose-down attitude and descending to ground contact. A surveillance video showed the helicopter descending rapidly at a steep angle in the last 2 seconds before impact. The helicopter impacted terrain about 700 ft north of the runway threshold, fatally injuring the instructor and seriously injuring the student. Postaccident examination of the helicopter and a test run of the engine revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight school's published procedure for practice autorotations instructed the pilot to initiate the maneuver first by lowering the collective, then reducing the throttle to idle. The practice of reducing the throttle to idle was contrary to manufacturer guidance for this maneuver, which stated that the throttle should be adjusted only enough to allow for a small tachometer needle separation in order to reduce the chance of inadvertent engine stoppage during the maneuver. The practice of reducing throttle to idle introduced greater susceptibility to a loss of engine power, though it could not be determined whether a loss of power occurred before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on conflicting statements from the student, it could not be determined who was controlling the helicopter during the entry into and throughout the autorotation before about 100 ft. The helicopter's trajectory described by a witness and as captured on surveillance video suggested a rapid, uncontrolled descent during the final portion of the autorotation, consistent with a main rotor stall; likely as a result of a premature application of collective pitch. This allowed the rotor rpm to decay below the normal operating range at an altitude that was insufficient for power recovery. In the event that the helicopter did experience a loss of power during the maneuver, the helicopter should have been able to attain a safe landing following a steady-state autorotation. The helicopter manufacturer published notices to pilots warning that main rotor stall due to low rotor rpm could occur rapidly, at any airspeed, and that if allowed to develop, recovery could become \"virtually impossible.\"",
    "FactualNarrative": "Cell Phone Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe CFI's cell phone was retained for examination in the NTSB vehicle recorders laboratory; however, the device was passcode-protected and could not be unlocked. Usage records obtained from the cellular service provider could not conclusively determine whether the phone was in use at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPractice Autorotations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot training syllabus provided by the flight school, the objective of Stage 3, Lesson 2 was for the student to practice advanced maneuvers and procedures, including normal and steep approach, normal and maximum performance takeoff, hovering, hover taxi, air taxi, ground reference maneuvers, emergency operations, autorotation to a power recovery, loss of tail rotor, stuck pedal, hovering out of ground effect, and confined area operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the student's training record indicated that he completed Stage 2 of the syllabus on December 23, 2014. Instructor notes for the previous flight, dated December 22, 2014, indicated, \"gap in training is evident in proficiency, basic straight [and] level unsatisfactory, [aeronautical decision making] needs work, approaches need work.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight school specified that all 180-degree and straight-in autorotations be terminated with a power recovery throughout the private pilot training course. School policy stated that all landings and practice autorotations were to be performed to a hard-surfaced runway or taxiway. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight school's written procedures for a straight-in autorotation with power recovery indicated that the maneuver should be initiated at an altitude of 700 feet agl after clearing the area for potential traffic conflicts and applying carburetor heat. Upon selecting a landing site, the autorotation was entered by lowering the collective to its full-down position, then rolling the throttle to the full idle position, where the procedure specified it should be held \"firmly against the stop for the remainder of the autorotation.\" About 40 feet agl, the recovery was initiated by applying aft cyclic to bring the helicopter to a skids-level attitude, where it was held for 3 seconds prior to entering a flare. At that time, the throttle was \"crack[ed] open\" to allow the rpm governor to operate, forward cyclic applied, and the collective raised to bring the helicopter to a hover about 5 feet agl. The maneuver guide also stated, \"Make an IMMEDIATE power recovery if the following conditions do not exist through 100' AGL: Aircraft aligned with touchdown point; Rotor RPM in the green; Airspeed within +/- 5 [knots] of 65 [knots]; Rate of descent &lt;1,500 fpm\". &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe manufacturer's Pilots Operating Handbook outlined the following procedure for a practice autorotation with a power recovery: \"1. Adjust carb heat as required. 2. Lower collective to down stop and adjust throttle as required for small tachometer needle separation. CAUTION: To avoid inadvertent engine stoppage, do not chop throttle to simulate a power failure. Always roll throttle off smoothly for a small visible needle split. 3. Adjust collective to keep rotor RPM in green arc and adjust throttle for small needle separation. 4. Keep airspeed 60 to 70 KIAS. 5. At about 40 feet AGL, begin cyclic flare to reduce rate of descent and forward speed. 6. At about 8 feet AGL, apply forward cyclic to level aircraft and raise collective to control descent. Add throttle if required to keep RPM in green arc.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRobinson Helicopter Company Safety Notice SN-38, \"Practice Autorotations Cause Many Training Accidents,\" stated, \"There have been instances when the engine has quit during practice autorotation. To avoid inadvertent engine stoppage, do not roll throttle to full idle. Reduce throttle smoothly for a small visible needle split, then hold throttle firmly to override governor. Recover immediately if engine is rough or engine RPM continues to drop.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSafety Notice SN-24, \"Low RPM Rotor Stall Can Be Fatal,\" stated, \"Rotor stall is very similar to the stall of an airplane wings at low airspeeds. As the airspeed of an airplane gets lower…the angle of attack of the wing must be higher for the wing to produce the lift required to support the weight of the airplane…The same thing happens during rotor stall with a helicopter except it occurs due to low rotor RPM instead of low airspeed. As the RPM of the rotor gets lower, the angle of attack of the rotor blades must be higher to generate the lift required to support the weight of the helicopter…Even if the collective is not raised by the pilot to provide the higher blade angle, the helicopter will start to descend until the upward movement of air to the rotor provides the necessary increase in blade angle of attack…The increased drag on the blades acts like a huge rotor brake causing the rotor RPM to rapidly decrease, further increasing the rotor stall. As the helicopter begins to fall, the upward rushing air continues to increase the angle of attack on the slowly-rotating blades, making recovery virtually impossible, even with full down collective.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA publication P-8740-71, \"Planning Autorotations,\"was intended to raise flight instructor awareness to the hazards of training students in autorotations and provide guidelines and parameters for conducting practice autorotations. The pamphlet concluded, \"The number one error in practice autorotations is the failure of the flight instructor to take control of the aircraft and terminate the maneuver before it progresses to a point where the flight instructor is not capable of recovering the aircraft in time to prevent damage to the aircraft or injury to personnel. REMEMBER: As a flight instructor, you are the most knowledgeable and experienced person in that helicopter. Do not let your student fly the helicopter into some corner of its performance envelope where it is not recoverable.\" - The helicopter was manufactured in 1996 and was equipped with one Lycoming O-360 series, 145 hp reciprocating engine. Review of maintenance records provided by the operator indicated that the helicopter's most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on December 1, 2014. At that time, the airframe had accumulated a total time of 4,162.9 hours, and the engine had accumulated 1,978.7 hours since its most recent overhaul. The helicopter's 2,200-hour inspection was completed on February 13, 2013 at a total airframe time of 2,184.2 hours. - On December 29, 2014, at 1025 eastern standard time, a Robinson R22 Beta, N771MM, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain while performing an autorotation near Palm Beach County Park Airport (LNA), Lake Worth, Florida. The flight instructor (CFI) was fatally injured, and the student pilot sustained serious injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local instructional flight, which departed about 0940. The flight was operated by Palm Beach Helicopters, Inc., and was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was a CFI, reported that he and a student were taxiing their airplane to runway 15 for takeoff when they heard the accident helicopter announce its position on a right base leg, with the intent to conduct an autorotation to taxiway Bravo. The CFI then offered to hold at the airplane's present position to allow the helicopter more room to conduct the maneuver. He stated that the helicopter pilot thanked him, and shortly thereafter, he observed the helicopter enter a \"rapid descent typical of [autorotation]\" from an altitude of between 800-1,000 feet above ground level (agl). About 500 feet agl, the helicopter appeared to level off, then pitched abruptly nose-down and descended to ground contact. Just prior to impact, he heard a panicked radio transmission from the helicopter that was mostly unintelligible. He also stated that, based on the accent he heard, he believed the CFI onboard the helicopter was conducting all radio transmissions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother CFI, who was taxiing a helicopter with a student on the south side of the airport, reported hearing the accident helicopter transmit, \"we're going in the grass\" over the airport's common traffic advisory frequency. Shortly thereafter, an airplane in the airport traffic pattern reported that there was a helicopter down, and the CFI in the helicopter flew to the accident site to render assistance.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a statement to law enforcement two days after the accident, the student pilot recounted that he and the CFI were practicing autorotations following a simulated engine failure. The student stated that he could not recall whether he or the CFI initiated the autorotation. About 100 feet above ground level, the CFI said, \"We're going down, we're going down,\" and at that time, the CFI was controlling the helicopter. The student stated that, until that point, the autorotation had \"appeared pretty normal,\" and he added, \"I don't know if the engine cut off, or the engine didn't turn back on.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a subsequent interview, conducted about two weeks after the accident, the student stated that the flight was Lesson 2 in Stage 3 of the school's private pilot training course. He reported that he could not recall most of the accident flight, but recalled that prior to the accident, he and the CFI had been flying for approximately 40 minutes and had conducted 2 or 3 steep approaches as well as a maximum-performance takeoff. The accident autorotation was the first of the accident flight.  He stated that he could not recall who initiated the autorotation or the rotor rpm indication during the maneuver. He remembered that the CFI was controlling the helicopter as it descended through about 100 feet above ground level, and as the CFI rolled on the throttle in an attempt to recover, there was no response from the engine. The CFI stated, \"We're going down, we're going down.\" The student also stated that, on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern, he observed the CFI using his cell phone and stated that he appeared to be conducting a video call, as he briefly saw someone on the phone's screen. He stated that the CFI turned the phone to face outside of the helicopter as if he was showing the view out the helicopter's windscreen to the individual on the phone. He could not recall when the CFI discontinued the use of the phone.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a written statement provided after the interview, the student recalled that the CFI \"asked for the controls,\" on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern prior to entering the autorotation. The student stated that he \"handed over the controls and looked south out my door enjoying the view.\" The student then recalled looking at the ground \"in a nose down attitude\" as the helicopter descended, and seeing the CFI \"fighting with the cyclic and collective.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSurveillance video from a building near the accident site captured approximately the last 2 seconds of the flight before impact, and showed the helicopter descending rapidly at a steep angle. - An autopsy was performed on the CFI by the Office of the District Medical Examiner, District 15, Palm Beach County, Florida. The cause of death was identified as blunt force injuries. Toxicological testing was performed by the FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Testing was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and all tested-for drugs and their metabolites. - The 0953 automated weather observation at PBI recorded wind from 180 degrees at 7 knots, 10 miles visibility, scattered clouds at 2,100 ft, temperature 26 degrees C, dew point 22 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.13 inches of mercury. Review of a carburetor icing probability chart revealed the potential for serious carburetor icing at glide power. - The CFI held commercial pilot and flight instructor certificates, both with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter; as well as an airframe and powerplant mechanic certificate. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) first-class medical certificate was issued in March 2014. Review of operator records revealed the CFI had about 397 total hours of flight experience, of which about 280 hours were in the accident helicopter make and model. He had accumulated about 121 hours of flight instruction given. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe student held an FAA second-class medical and student pilot certificate, which was issued in December 2012. He reported about 37 total hours of flight time, all of which was in the accident helicopter make and model. - The helicopter came to rest on its left side in a grassy area about 700 feet northwest of the runway 15 threshold at LNA. The wreckage path was oriented approximately 140 degrees magnetic, and extended about 75 feet from the initial impact point to where the fuselage came to rest. The initial impact point was identified as a large metal stake, about 3 feet in height. The second point of impact was a small crater measuring about 4 feet long and 1 foot deep, located about 15 feet past the initial impact point. A portion of the forward skid crosstube was located in the crater. The vertical stabilizer, horizontal stabilizer, and portion of the tail rotor came to rest next to the crater. The tail boom was separated from the fuselage, and fractured into several pieces, some of which displayed signatures consistent with main rotor blade contact. The skids separated from the fuselage and were fractured into several sections, which were located along the wreckage path. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuselage exhibited downward crushing, and the cabin was fractured aft of the seat structures. Both the auxiliary and main fuel tanks were intact and contained fuel, and both fuel caps were secure. The fuel vent tubes were separated from the auxiliary tank by impact, which allowed fuel to drain from the tanks following the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor remained attached to the fuselage. One blade was bent up and displayed several chordwise creases along its span. The second blade was bent up about 45 degrees near its root. Neither blade displayed significant leading edge damage. The tail rotor drive shaft separated from the helicopter during the accident sequence, and a 5-foot portion was located about 500 feet west of the main wreckage. The aft portion of the tail rotor drive shaft was not recovered.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was removed from the accident site and transported to a secure facility for further examination. Flight control continuity was confirmed from the cockpit area to the main rotor system. Tail rotor control continuity was established from the cockpit to the intermediate flex coupling. The main rotor gearbox rotated smoothly by hand with no anomalies observed. Examination of the v-belts, sheaves, and overrunning clutch also revealed no anomalies. Tail rotor drive continuity was established from the upper drive sheave to the intermediate flex coupling. The tail rotor gearbox rotated smoothly, with no anomalies noted. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the airframe at its mount. The mixture control wire was impact-separated from the mixture control arm. The carburetor heat control was bent, and was in the off position. The carburetor air box was partially crushed, and the carburetor heat slider valve was in a mid-travel, partially open position. The carburetor remained attached to the engine, and the throttle control arm was observed about 1/8 inch from the full-throttle position. The exhaust system was partially crushed. The sparkplugs were removed and displayed normal wear characteristics. The engine was rotated by hand at the cooling fan, and thumb compression was obtained on all cylinders. Crankshaft continuity was established to the accessory gears. Oil was added to the engine to facilitate a test run, and when power was applied to the engine starter, the engine started, accelerated, and ran continuously for several minutes utilizing the fuel onboard. A magneto check was performed with no anomalies noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was shut down, and the carburetor, oil filter, and oil suction screen were removed for examination. The carburetor float bowl contained blue liquid consistent with 100LL aviation fuel, and did not display any sign of contamination. There was no damage to the internal components of the carburetor, and the fuel inlet screen was absent of debris. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Before the accident flight, the commercial helicopter pilot, who was also a mechanic, had re-installed the main rotor blades, which had just been reworked, on the helicopter. The accident flight was a test flight to adjust the track and balance of the rotor blades. A mechanic, who spoke with the pilot a few weeks before the accident, stated that they had a discussion about an elongated pitch change link attachment hole on the accident helicopter and how to address it. On the night before the accident flight, they spoke again; the pilot was having trouble tracking the blades on the accident helicopter.  The pilot stated that he could not get the blades to track any better, and that he was trying to change the track with the trim tabs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses in the area of the accident site heard \"popping\" or \"banging\" sounds, then saw the main rotor and empennage separate from the helicopter. Several of the witnesses then saw the helicopter tumble in flight and impact the roof of a building. The main rotor and empennage came to rest on the ground a few hundred feet from the building. Witness statements and wreckage documentation were consistent with a main rotor blade striking the tail and subsequently, a mast bump, which resulted in the helicopter descending uncontrollably.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe damage observed on the components of the main rotor system was consistent with an in-flight separation of the pitch change link for the red blade, with separation occurring at the location where the pitch change link attached to the swashplate. The swashplate was free of contact marks corresponding to contact with the red pitch change link, which contrasted with the area around the blue blade pitch change link attachment, where multiple contact marks corresponding to contact with the blue pitch change link were observed. Also, the red pitch change link was intact and relatively straight, indicating that separation occurred under loads less than that required to buckle or fracture the pitch change link. The slight bending in the red pitch change links was likely secondary to the separation of the attachment at the lower end as evidenced by the location of the corresponding thread contact marks on the pitch horn. Finally, a series of impressions corresponding to contact with threads on the red blade pitch change link attachment bolt were observed on the attachment hole bore through the swashplate in an area that should have only contacted the grip portion of the bolt. Thus, it is likely that the intact bolt separated from the attachment due to loss of the lock nut and palnut.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTorque measurements were obtained on the locknuts installed on the three recovered pitch change link attachment bolts. All measured torque values were lower than that specified in the helicopter's maintenance manual, indicating that the fasteners were improperly torqued before the accident. While torque for the missing attachment bolt could not be measured, the torque measured on the remaining pitch change link attachment bolts and witness marks on the attachment hole bore in the swashplate suggest that the bolt likely separated due to insufficient torque applied at the time of installation, which led to the loss of the locknut and palnut due to vibrational loads under normal operation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 2, 2014, about 1400 mountain standard time, a Robinson R44 II helicopter, N3234U, impacted a two-story building while maneuvering near Skypark Airport (BTF), Bountiful, Utah. The commercial pilot/mechanic and passenger were fatally injured, and the helicopter was substantially damaged. The helicopter was registered to Native Range Capture Services, Inc., Elko, Nevada, and operated by Native Range, Inc, Ventura, California. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the area, and no flight plan was filed for the local,  post-maintenance test flight, which was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The flight departed from BTF shortly before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the owner of the helicopter, the pilot/mechanic was performing maintenance on the main rotor assembly and the purpose of the post-maintenance flight was part of the procedure to \"track and balance\" the main rotor blades. This maintenance spanned over several days.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses in the area of the accident site heard \"popping\" or \"banging\" sounds then saw the main rotor and empennage separate from the helicopter. Some of the witnesses then saw the helicopter tumble in flight and impact the top of a building. The main rotor and empennage came to rest on the ground a few hundred feet from the impacted building. Security camera video footage from a nearby business captured the helicopter in the air shortly after the separation of the main rotor and empennage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 65, held a commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft, airplane single-engine land, multi-engine land, and instrument ratings. The pilot held a  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second-class medical certificate, which was issued on April 1, 2014, with no limitations. The pilot reported on his most recent medical certificate application that he had accumulated 5,500 total hours of flight experience. The pilot was issued a mechanic certificate on August 17, 2012, with ratings for airframe and powerplant. He attended the Robinson Helicopter Company's maintenance course in December 2008.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe passenger, age 63, held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. He held an FAA third-class medical certificate, issued on October 26, 2006, with the limitations that he must have available glasses for near vision, and not valid for any class after. The pilot reported on his most recent medical certificate application that he had accumulated 250 total hours of flight experience. He was issued a mechanic certificate on September 9, 2008, with ratings for airframe and powerplant. He had not attended the Robinson Helicopter Company's maintenance course.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe four-seat helicopter was manufactured in February 2007. It was powered by a Lycoming IO-540-AE1A5 reciprocating engine rated at 205 horsepower.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's owner stated that, during a flight in the accident helicopter the month before the accident, the helicopter \"had a bit of a vertical [vertical vibrations]\". The blades also had noticeable slop and movement in the pitch change link bolt attachment to the swashplate. During a 100-hour inspection, on November 2, 2014, at 582 hours of helicopter total time, the owner and pilot/mechanic recommended sending the blades out for rework. According to airframe records, the [red] main rotor blade pitch horn was replaced, and the pilot-rated mechanic declined repainting of the blades. When the blades returned, the owner hired the pilot-rated mechanic to install the blades and track them in a heavier configuration.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a mechanic who spoke with the pilot a few weeks before the accident, they discussed an elongated pitch change link attachment hole on the accident helicopter and how to address it. On the night before the accident flight, they spoke again, and the pilot said he was having trouble tracking the blades on the accident helicopter. He reported that the blades could not track any better than a 1/2-inch separation, and that he was using the trim tabs to change the track. The mechanic suggested that the pilot use the fine adjustments on the pitch change links, then fly through all flight regimes, and fine tune with the trim tabs. He recommended to the pilot to look at the entire rotor system and thought that something was amiss.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the helicopter's maintenance records showed that on September 12, 2007, at 87.3 hours  total time, the hub and blades were rebuilt by Robinson Helicopter Company. The spindles, which include the pitch horns, were reused during the rebuild.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 1353 weather observation at Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC), Salt Lake City, Utah, located 5 miles south of the accident site, reported wind from 320 degrees at 3 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, scattered clouds at 15,000 feet above ground level, broken clouds at 19,000 above ground level, temperature 8 degrees C, dew point 2 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.05 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) revealed a wreckage debris field about 880 ft in length, about 400 ft in width, and oriented on a 277° magnetic heading. The main rotor and empennage separated from the main wreckage before impact and were found within the wreckage debris field. The main rotor assembly was found near a parking lot about 188 ft from the main wreckage. The empennage separated from the main wreckage and was found near a parking lot about 430 ft from the main wreckage. Several sections of the tail rotor drive shaft were found throughout the debris field. A large section of the tail rotor drive shaft pierced the roof about 90 ft from where the fuselage entered the roof. Both pitch change links and transmission housing material were found throughout the debris field. Plexiglas sections were found throughout the debris field. A 4-ft section of the main rotor blade tip was found in a retention pond and was furthest from the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage impacted and penetrated the roof of a two-story building about 2,000 ft southwest of the approach end of runway 34 at BTF. A postimpact fire occurred; however, the building's sprinkler system was activated, and an overhead sprinkler pressure line was separated near the main wreckage, releasing water and limiting the postimpact fire to the main wreckage. The main wreckage displayed impact damage and was partially damaged by the fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered to a secure facility for further examination. The main wreckage, consisting of the cabin area and a 5-ft section of the tailboom, exhibited impact and thermal damage. The left side of the cabin was crushed inward towards the center, and the right side near the firewall was crushed inward. The rear seat area had minor thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cabin area was crushed and distorted. Both forward seat structures were crushed inward and slightly forward. The front of the fuselage was crushed inward and the windshield was shattered. First responders cut the left forward seat belts. The right forward seat belts were unbuckled.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe top side of the airframe had several disconnects and separations, and was bent to the right side. The tail cone separated aft of the number seven bay, and bay numbers 4, 5 and 6 separated into several sections, consistent with a main rotor strike. The left side of the number 1, 2 and 3 tail cone bays were flattened inward.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight controls had several disconnects between the cyclic/collective and swashplate. All fractures exhibited signatures consistent with overload. The tail rotor flight controls had several disconnects from the pedals to the tail rotor, and all separations exhibited overload signatures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel tanks remained attached to the airframe. The crossover hose fitting at the main tank was separated. The fuel vent hoses pulled apart from vent line fittings. The hoses and lines were clear of debris. Both fuel tank skins sustained impact damage, and the bladders remained intact. Both fuel caps remained secured to the filler neck.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe empennage was fractured about 32 inches from the tail rotor gearbox mount. The tail rotor blades sustained minor impact damage. The tail rotor driveshaft exhibited an impact about 4 inches from the empennage separation. The curvature of the impact mark was consistent with the curvature of the main rotor blade leading edge. The tail rotor drive shaft separated in four places. The tail rotor blades exhibited signatures consistent with low rotor RPM at ground impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe v-belts remained attached to the upper sheave and were split between the vees. The belts had thermal damage. The intermediate flex plate was distorted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe upper sheave forward and aft faces had rotational scoring around the entire circumference. The upper frame tubes adjacent to the forward face had scoring running in the direction of rotation of the upper sheave. The clutch centering strut had rotational scoring on its forward face adjacent to the aft face of the upper sheave running in the direction of rotation. The oil cooler had rotational scoring adjacent to the starter ring gear. The alternator cooling fan was distorted around its entire circumference.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor gearbox (MRGB) separated at the gearbox housing. The MRGB mast tube fractured near its midsection. The MRGB drive shaft was bent below the swashplate and bent and separated at the teeter stop.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe red blade remained attached to the main rotor hub. The separated sections of the outboard end were found in the debris field. The tip cap was broken, with the attachment bolts still integral to the main rotor blade. The blade tip and about 43 inches of the leading edge spar were found near the beginning of the debris field. Two afterbody sections measuring about 45 inches in length separated the tip. Gray paint transfer marks, about 2 inches wide and 4 inches long, were observed on the upper surface about 25 inches from the tip. The blade spar was bent forward about 15° beginning about 54 inches from the tip. The leading edge was damaged about 4 ft from the hub. Red transfer marks on the leading edge were found about 42 inches from the center of rotation of the blade. The pitch horn separated from the blade grip and the fractured surface was consistent with overload. Thread imprints were observed above the pitch change link upper rod end. The pitch change link remained attached to the pitch change horn and had multiple bends. The counterweights and hardware for the lower red blade pitch change link to swashplate attachment was not found. The blade droop stop was bent downward and remained attached to the grip.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe blue blade remained attached to the main rotor hub. The tip cap separated from the blade and was found in the main wreckage. The blade spar was continuous from the inboard to the outboard end. The blade afterbody was fractured from the spar to the tip end to about 72 inches inboard. The spar was bent opposite the direction of rotation about 72 inches from the tip end, bent about 15° aft. The blade afterbody wrinkled aft of the spar attachment area from the tip end to 96 inches inboard of the tip end. The blue blade had impact marks on the leading edge, about 20 inches from the center of rotation. The curvature of the impact marks was consistent with the curvature of damage on the blue blade's pitch horn. The pitch horn was fractured at the blade grip, and the fracture surface was consistent with overload. Thread imprints were observed on the pitch horn above the pitch change link upper rod end. The droop stop was bent downward but remained integral to the grip. The pitch change horn was recovered in the debris field. The upper rod end remained attached to the pitch change horn but was fractured at the threads beneath the upper rod end bearing. The midsection of the pitch change link was recovered loose but was fractured at the pitch change link barrel. The lower section of the pitch change link remained attached to the swashplate. The threads adjacent to the lower rod end were bent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub hardware, including the bolts, shims, nuts, and safeties, remained intact. The hub exhibited impact marks of the blue blade grip contacting the hub, consistent with flapping exceedance. Similar impact marks of less severity were observed on the red blade grip side. A small upper section of the main rotor drive shaft remained attached to the hub via the teetering bolt. The small upper section separated a few inches below the hub, and was severely bent inward on the side of the red blade spindle. Coarse thread imprints were found on the lower edge of the hub immediately beneath the red blade coning bolt, consistent with a pitch change link. On the upper surface of the hub, adjacent to the teetering bolt on the red blade side, an impact mark was consistent with the impact from a pitch change rod link end bearing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe swashplate red blade pitch change link bolt hole exhibited dark surface markings on the outboard edge and about midway down the bore. Thread impact marks were found on the swashplate adjacent to the lower rod end bearing of the blue blade pitch change link attachment location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing skids were fractured in multiple locations. The aft crosstube separated from the main wreckage. The forward crosstube remained attached to the cabin. Both the forward left and aft left struts were bent aft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the fuselage. Thermal damage was noted to the wiring harness and ignition leads. The engine was covered in a sooty residue. The firewall and fuel pump housing exhibited impact damage. The magneto ignition leads exhibited impact damage near the distributer cap, and thermal damage near the cylinders. The lower sparkplugs were removed and revealed normal wear conditions with light gray deposits. Two of the spark plugs were saturated in oil. The crankshaft was rotated by hand, and cylinder compression was obtained. The ignition leads were cut near the thermal damage, and spark was obtained from all leads during crankshaft rotation. The magnetos were not removed during the examination. Rotational scoring was evident on the fan wheel assembly. The starter ring gear separated from the flywheel. The oil pickup screen was removed and was clear of debris. The exhaust assembly was crushed upwards.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA detailed report of a follow-up examination is contained in the NTSB public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostmortem examinations were performed on the pilot and passenger by the Utah Department of Health, Medical Examiner's office. The cause of death for each was reported as total body blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute performed forensic toxicology on specimens from the pilot. The tests were negative for carbon monoxide, cyanide, volatiles and tested-for drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEST AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blades (both inboard sections), hub, upper mast section, upper drive shaft section, droop stops (2), yoke, pitch change links (2), main rotor blade pitch change horns (2), and swashplate were sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for further examination. The examination revealed that all fractures were consisted with overstress failure, and no preexisting cracking was noted. The examination also revealed that the pitch change link attachment hole for the red blade appeared intact and free of damage. The red blade pitch link was intact and relatively straight. The counterweights and the lower red blade pitch change link attachment hardware were missing. Torque measurements were taken on nuts installed on the three recovered pitch change link attachment bolts. The torque values for all three nuts were lower than that required by the manufacturer's maintenance manual. A detailed report of the examination is contained in the NTSB public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to manufacturer's maintenance instructions, the attachment bolts used at the upper and lower ends of the pitch change links are NAS6605 series bolts. The locknuts for the NAS6605 series bolts should be fastened to a dry torque value of 240 lb-in ± 24 lb-in, and palnuts used on NAS6605 series bolts should be applied with a dry torque of 20 lb-in to 40 lb-in. During installation, the palnuts are installed over the top of the locking nut. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot reported that he was making an approach to a hospital helipad into light wind at night when he chose to go around because he felt that the approach was too high and fast. The pilot lowered the helicopter's nose, added power, and raised the collective, and the helicopter then entered a rapid, \"violent\" right spin. A review of the last 43 seconds of the helicopter's flight track data revealed that, as the helicopter approached the helipad, it descended from 202 to 152 ft and decelerated from a ground speed of about 9 to 5 knots before it turned right. The pilot attempted to recover from the uncommanded spin by applying left antitorque pedal and cyclic, but he was unable to recover, and the helicopter then spun several times before impacting power lines/terrain. Postaccident examination of the helicopter and the engine revealed no mechanical anomalies that would have caused the helicopter's uncommanded right spin. The helicopter was under its maximum allowable gross weight at the time of the accident, and the wind was less than 4 knots. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration guidance states that the loss of tail rotor effectiveness could result in an uncommanded rapid yaw, which, if not corrected, could result in the loss of aircraft control. The guidance further indicates that, at airspeeds below translational lift, the tail rotor is required to produce nearly 100 percent of the directional control and that, if the required amount of tail rotor thrust is not available, the aircraft will yaw right. Therefore, it is likely that that the pilot did not adequately account for the helicopter's low airspeed when he applied power to go around, which resulted in a sudden, uncommanded right yaw due to a loss of tail rotor effectiveness.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn October 4, 2014, about 0155 central daylight time, N335AE, a Bell 206L1+ helicopter, was destroyed by post-impact fire after it impacted terrain while on approach to the United Regional Hospital helipad, in Wichita Falls, Texas. The commercial pilot was seriously injured and the flight nurse, paramedic, and patient died. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Air Evac EMS, Inc, O'Fallon, Missouri. A company visual flight rules flight plan was filed for the patient transfer flight that departed Jackson County Hospital, near Waurika, Oklahoma, about 0133. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the air medical flight conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was a photojournalist for NBC News 3 in Wichita Falls, TX, was driving southbound on the central freeway and was passing over Maurine Street when he first saw the helicopter. He said it appeared to be flying toward the \"north\" and its spotlight was turned on. As the witness continued to drive south toward downtown Wichita Falls, he realized the helicopter was hovering over 10th and Grace Streets and he thought it was odd that the helicopter had not landed yet and maybe he was waiting for someone to clear off the helipad. The witness said the helicopter was hovering at a height that was equal to the height of the top of the hospital, about 100-120 feet. The witness said that when he reached 9th Street, he saw the helicopter begin to spin to the right and move from its position over 10th and Grace Streets south toward the helipad. He said the helicopter entered the spin slowly and began to descend as soon as it started to spin. Initially, the witness thought the helicopter was going to land, but it continued to spin and descend. The helicopter then disappeared from his view behind a building. Shortly after it disappeared from his view, the witness saw sparks. He called 911 and drove the scene. Once he arrived on-scene the police and first responders were already there.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, he and his Duncan, Oklahoma, based medical crew had just returned from a flight to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, when he received a call from company dispatch to pick-up a patient in Waurika and transport him to United Regional Hospital in Wichita Falls. The pilot accepted the flight, but told dispatch that they needed 15 minutes on the ground to prepare for the flight since they had just landed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that he, along with the paramedic and flight nurse, re-boarded the helicopter, performed the necessary checklists, called dispatch and filed a flight plan. The flight to Waurika was uneventful. After landing, the pilot stayed in the helicopter for about 20 minutes with the engine running while the patient was prepped and loaded. The pilot and medical crew then departed for Wichita Falls. The weather was clear and the wind was three knots or less. The pilot said he used night-vision-goggles (NVGs) while en route, but flipped them up as he approached the hospital due to intense ground lighting. Upon arriving in Wichita Falls, the pilot said he performed a \"high recon\" of United Regional Hospital's helipad and called out his intentions to land. He performed the pre-landing checklists, and started the approach to the helipad from the northwest at an altitude of 700 feet above ground level (agl). Both of the hospital's lighted windsocks were \"limp\" but were positioned so they were pointing toward the northwest. The pilot, who said he had landed at this helipad on numerous occasions, said the approach was normal until he got closer to the helipad. He said he felt fast \"about 12-15 knots\" and a \"little high,\" so he decided to abort the approach. At this point, with about ¼ to ½ -inch of left anti-torque pedal applied, he added power, \"tipped the nose over to get airspeed,\" and \"pulled collective.\" The pilot said that as soon as he brought the collective up, the helicopter entered a rapid right spin. He described the spin as \"violent\" and that it was the fastest he had ever \"spun\" in a helicopter. The pilot told the crew to hold on and that he was \"going to try and fly out of it.\" The pilot said he tried hard to get control of the helicopter by applying cyclic and initially \"some\" left anti-torque pedal \"but nothing happened.\" The pilot said he added more left anti-torque pedal, but not full left anti-torque pedal as the helicopter continued to spin and he was still unable to regain control. He also said the engine had plenty of power and was operating fine. The pilot recalled the helicopter spinning at least five times before impacting the ground inverted. He said smoke quickly filled the inside of the helicopter, so he unbuckled his seatbelt assembly, took off his helmet, punched out the windshield and exited the burning helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot also said that he did not hear any unusual noises prior to the \"tail coming out from underneath them\" and he did not recall hearing any warning horns or seeing any warning/caution lights. When asked what he thought caused the helicopter to spin to the right so quickly, he replied, \"I don't know.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a handheld Garmin GPS 396 and Sky Trac ISAT-100 flight-tracking software. The SkyTrac system recorded position every 5 seconds versus the GPS that recorded position every 60 seconds. Data was successfully downloaded from each unit. The data between the two units was fairly consistent and revealed that after the helicopter departed Waurika, it flew on a south-westerly heading until it crossed Highway 447 in Wichita Falls. It then flew on a westerly heading until it reached Highway 287, where it then turned on a north westerly heading. As it proceeded to the northwest, the helicopter flew past United Regional Hospital to the east before it made a left, 180 degree turn about 1 to 1.5 miles north of the hospital. The helicopter then proceeded directly to the helipad on a south-easterly heading. A review of the last 43 seconds of the recorded Sky Trac data revealed that as the helicopter approached the helipad, it descended from an altitude of 202 feet to 152 feet and decelerated from a ground-speed of about 9 knots to about 5 knots before it turned to the right.  Over the next 10 seconds, the helicopter traveled back toward the northwest as it descended to an altitude of 54 feet and increased to a ground-speed of about 17 knots before the data ended at 0155:14. The location of the last recorded data point was consistent with where the helicopter impacted the ground. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA portion of the accident flight and impact were captured on one of the hospital's surveillance cameras. A review of the surveillance tape revealed the helicopter approached the helipad from the north with the spotlight turned on (the pilot said that he used the spotlight during the approach). The helicopter then climbed and went out of frame before it reappeared in a descending right hand turn then hit the ground. The time of impact was recorded at 0154:56. About 6 seconds later, there was a large explosion.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother Air Evac flight crew (pilot, paramedic, and a flight nurse) was based at United Regional Hospital, and were in their quarters near the helipad when the hospital-based pilot heard the helicopter. The crew was preparing to assist the inbound crew with the patient transfer. The hospital-based pilot stated that when he opened the door to their quarters, he heard the helicopter arriving from the north. As the helicopter got closer, he heard \"a change in rotor noise\" followed by the sound of a \"snap then bang then silence.\" The hospital-based pilot yelled to his crew that the helicopter may have crashed. All three immediately responded to the accident site where they found the helicopter upside down, facing west, and on-fire. The hospital-based pilot said the flight nurse, who was seated in the rear right seat, was lying about 6-feet away from the helicopter. She was on fire and most of her Nomex flight suit had burned away. The hospital-based pilot also saw the paramedic, who was seated in the rear, left seat, crawling out of the wreckage and the pilot was crawling out of the front of the wreckage. Due to the intense fire, there was no way to assist the patient.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hospital-based paramedic stated that he was asleep when he was alerted of the inbound flight.  He heard the helicopter approaching \"then nothing.\" The lights in their crew-quarters then flickered for about 10 seconds. The hospital-based pilot then came in and said the helicopter had crashed. The hospital-based paramedic said that when he got to the accident site, the flight nurse was lying on her back on the sidewalk. The paramedic was on fire and about 10 feet away from the helicopter in the street. A bystander was using his shirt to put out the flames on the paramedic. The hospital-based paramedic then ran over to the injured paramedic. He said the paramedic was alert and was aware that he was involved in an accident. The hospital-based paramedic said he picked the injured paramedic up, placed him on a gurney and took him to the emergency room. He did not talk to the flight nurse or pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hospital-based flight nurse stated he was in bed, but had not fallen asleep. He heard the hospital-based pilot say that a company helicopter was inbound and he could hear it approaching the helipad. The flight nurse said he was putting on his jumpsuit when he heard the helicopter \"power-up\" followed by silence then the sound of a \"crash.\"  He and the two others immediately responded to the accident site.  When the hospital-based flight nurse arrived on scene, he saw the flight nurse and thought she was deceased until she started screaming for help. The pilot was crawling through the front windshield and his foot was stuck. There was a \"winding noise\" coming from the helicopter so he helped him get out and away from the burning helicopter. He asked the pilot if he was ok, and he responded, \"I don't know.\" The hospital-based flight nurse then saw the hospital-based paramedic dragging the injured paramedic away from the helicopter. He immediately realized the injured paramedic was a good friend and his flight partner. The hospital based flight nurse immediately went over to him and found the injured paramedic was alert. The injured paramedic said they were on final approach to the helipad when the helicopter started to spin, but he wasn't sure why.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hospital-based flight nurse later asked the pilot what happened, and the pilot said \"he wasn't sure.\" When he told the pilot that the paramedic said that the helicopter had spun, the pilot responded, \"yeah.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe patient died in the accident but the flight nurse and the paramedic survived and were treated for severe burns. However, they both succumbed to their injuries within a month after the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a commercial pilot certificate for rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument rotorcraft-helicopter. The operator reported his total flight time as 1,810 hours. About 1,584 of those hours were in helicopters, of which, 214 hours were in the Bell 206 series helicopter. His last Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second class medical was issued on May 13, 2014, without limitations or waivers. The pilot was also a chief warrant officer with the United States Army. He attended Army flight school and was trained in the CH47D Chinook helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to time-on-duty records provided by the operator, the pilot came on duty October 2, 2014, at 1810. This was the start of his first shift after having the previous 6 days off. He had only made one flight prior to the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was hired by the operator on June 9, 2014. At that time, he reported a total of 1,755.6 total hours, of which, 159.1 hours were in the Bell 206 model helicopter. A review of his training records revealed he started initial/new-hire training on June 10, 2014, and satisfactorily completed ground school and 10.9 hours of flight training. The training included normal and emergency procedures, including loss of tail rotor effectiveness. On June 22, 2014, the pilot passed a flight crew-member competency/proficiency check- Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 135/NVG check ride. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot also completed \"Initial Orientation-Flight\" training at his assigned base in Duncan, Oklahoma. The training involved 5 flight hours and included cross country flights to the local area hospitals and landmarks; 2 hours of night flying for the same purpose; day and night approaches to hospital and elevated helipads; familiarization with all hazards, terrain and man-made, identified on the Duncan, Oklahoma base hazard map. This training was completed on July 8, 2014.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather at Sheppard Air Force Base/Wichita Falls Municipal Airport (SPS), about 5 miles north of the accident site, at 0152, was wind from 140 degrees at 3 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear skies, temperature 51 degrees F, dewpoint 33 degrees F, and a barometric pressure setting of 30.24 in HG.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHELIPAD INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe United Regional Hospital's ground-level helipad was located directly across the street from the hospital's emergency room entrance. The final approach/take-off area (FATO) was 60-foot-wide by 60-foot-long and was privately owned and operated by United Regional Health Care System. At the time of the accident, the hospital based flight crew's helicopter was in the hangar and the helipad was clear of obstacles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe single-engine, seven-place helicopter was manufactured in 1981 and equipped with a Rolls-Royce C-250-30P turbo shaft engine. It was configured for air medical transport; one pilot, two medical crew, and one patient. The operator reported that at the time of the accident, the airframe had about 18,378.6 hours total time and the engine had about 3,546.2 hours total time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was retrofitted with Van Horn Aviation (VHA) after-market composite tail rotor blades (Supplemental Type Certificate No. SR02249LA). According to VHA's website, this install helps reduce overall aircraft noise and produce more tail rotor authority. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe estimated gross weight of the helicopter at the time of the accident was 4,274 pounds, or about 176 pounds below the maximum gross weight of 4,450 pounds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn on-scene examination of the helicopter was conducted on October 4-5, 2014, under the supervision of the National Transportation Safety Board Investigator-in-Charge (NTSB IIC). The helicopter collided with power lines and came to rest inverted between two trees that lined a public sidewalk about one block northwest of the helipad. All major components of the helicopter were located at the main impact site. Small sections of the helicopter were found strewn within 100 feet of where the main wreckage came to rest.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was recovered and taken to a salvage facility where a layout examination was conducted on October 6, 2014. The above mentioned party members were in attendance for both the on-scene and salvage yard exams.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter wreckage was extensively burned and fragmented into large and small sections. These sections were laid out in a manner that was consistent with how they would have been situated prior to the accident. The tail rotor and portion of the empennage sustained the least amount of impact and fire damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom had separated from the main body of the helicopter just aft of where it attached to the fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth tail rotor blades exhibited minor leading edge damage and there was some de-bonding on the trailing edge. The pitch control tube to the gearbox to the 90-degree bend and forward to where the tail boom had separated from the fuselage was intact. The tail rotor gearbox magnetic plug was clean and there was no fluid observed the tail rotor gearbox sight-glass.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right horizontal fin remained attached to the tailboom and exhibited some thermal damage. The left horizontal fin was folded under and burned.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor driveshaft was relatively intact, but damage was noted to the Thomas couplings, which were splayed, and the hangar bearing between #1 and #2 was out of alignment.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft short-shaft was separated and exhibited thermal damage. The forward end of the short shaft was burned. The shaft did not rotate due to thermal damage. The oil cooler blower housing had mostly melted away.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe front end of the oil cooler blower shaft and spines were intact. The forward short-shaft was attached to the aft end of the freewheeling unit located in the engine accessory gear box. But the aft end that attached to the forward end of the oil cooler blower shaft was separated. The splines were intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe freewheeling (FW) unit rotated, but did not turn due to thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flex frames on both ends of the main drive shaft were fractured. There was no twist in the shaft. The engine to transmission adapter on the aft of the transmission was rotated and continuity was established to the main rotor system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nControl tubes were fractured and thermally damaged, but continuity was established for the throttle control and collective to the broom closet. Continuity for the cyclic was also established, but the cyclic control had fractured and was found in the wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left anti-torque pedals (co-pilot side) dual control pedal assembly was installed, but the linkage had been disconnected and the pedals were locked by the operator to prevent someone from inadvertently depressing the pedals. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nContinuity was established for the right anti-torque pedals. An impact mark was observed on a section of the anti-torque pedal assembly where it ran through a lightning hole in the lower fuselage. A measurement from the center of the bolt that secures this tube to the location of the impact mark was taken. Then, the measurement was used to determine the position of the pedal at the time of impact by lining the mark up with an exemplar helicopter. The measurement revealed the right pedal was displaced about 50-75% at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rotating and non-rotating sections of the swash plate were fractured and burned, and the control links were fractured and thermally damaged. Extensive thermal damage was noted to the transmission.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth of the main rotor blades exhibited impact and fire damage. Blade #1 had fractured outside of the doublers. About 6 feet of the outboard blade exhibited impact damage and about 24-inches of the blade tip had separated and was not burned. A section of the blade tip exhibited impact and striations marks consistent with it striking a cable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBlade #2 was also fractured at the doublers. The after-body was missing due to fire. The tip of the blade was partially attached with a small unburned section being completely separated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThough the helicopter sustained extensive thermal damage, continuity for all the main flight control systems was established and no pre-mishap mechanical anomalies were observed that would have precluded normal operation prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt was also observed that the two main fuel lines that transfer fuel from the forward fuel tanks to the main tanks were separated at their rear fittings just aft of the broom closet. According to the FAA and Bell, there are no break-away fittings or mechanism (sensor) that would have sensed a separation and stopped fuel flow after the accident if power was applied. If the engine continued to run after the accident, raw fuel would have continued to be pumped into the aft cabin area from the forward tanks. Fuel may have also drained from vent lines due to the helicopter being inverted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine sustained extensive thermal damage. The engine was separated into sections and no pre-mishap anomalies were noted that would have precluded normal operation prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe annunciator panel was examined by the NTSB Materials Laboratory for the presence of any stretched light bulb filaments. Each annunciator light was x-rayed to determine the status of the two bulbs inside. While there was some evidence of age-related sagging, no stretched filaments were found in any of the annunciator lights.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA toxicological examination was conducted on \"first-draw\" blood specimens taken from the pilot when he was admitted to United Regional hospital's emergency room after the accident. These specimens were subpoenaed by the NTSB and shipped to the FAA's Accident Investigation Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The results of the testing were negative for all items tested.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA issued Advisory Circular (AC) 90-95, Unanticipated Right Yaw in Helicopters, in February 1995. The AC stated that the loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) was a critical, low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic which could result in an uncommanded rapid yaw rate which does not subside of its own accord and, if not corrected, could result in the loss of aircraft control. It also stated, \"LTE is not related to a maintenance malfunction and may occur in varying degrees in all single main rotor helicopters at airspeeds less than 30 knots.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nParagraph 8 of the AC stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"OTHER FACTORS...Low Indicated Airspeed. At airspeeds below translational lift, the tail rotor is required to produce nearly 100 percent of the directional control. If the required amount of tail rotor thrust is not available for any reason, the aircraft will yaw to the right.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Rotorcraft Flying handbook (FAA-H-8083-21A), \"Loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) or an unanticipated yaw is defined as an uncommanded, rapid yaw towards the advancing blade which does not subside of its own accord. It can result in the loss of the aircraft if left unchecked. It is very important for pilots to understand that LTE is caused by an aerodynamic interaction between the main rotor and tail rotor and not caused from a mechanical failure. Some helicopter types are more likely to encounter LTE due to the normal certification thrust produced by having a tail rotor that, although meeting certification standards, is not always able to produce the additional thrust demanded by the pilot.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"LTE is an aerodynamic condition and is the result of a control margin deficiency in the tail rotor. It can affect all single rotor helicopters that utilize a tail rotor of some design. The design of main and tail rotor blades and the tail boom assembly can affect the characteristics and susceptibility of LTE but will not nullify the phenomenon entirely.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThis alteration of tail rotor thrust can be affected by numerous external factors. The main factors contributing to LTE are:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1. Airflow and downdraft generated by the main rotor blades interfering with the airflow entering the tail rotor assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n2. Main blade vortices developed at the main blade tips entering the tail rotor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n3. Turbulence and other natural phenomena affecting the airflow surrounding the tail rotor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n4. A high power setting, hence large main rotor pitch angle, induces considerable main rotor blade downwash and hence more turbulence than when the&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nhelicopter is in a low power condition.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n5. A slow forward airspeed, typically at speeds where translational lift and translational thrust are in the process of change and airflow around the tail rotor will vary in direction and speed.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"If a sudden unanticipated right yaw occurs, the following recovery technique should be performed. Apply forward cyclic control to increase speed. If altitude permits, reduce power. As recovery is affected, adjust controls for normal forward flight. A recovery path must always be planned, especially when terminating to an OGE hover and executed immediately if an uncommanded yaw is evident. Collective pitch reduction aids in arresting the yaw rate but  may cause an excessive rate of descent. Any large, rapid increase in collective to prevent ground or obstacle contact may further increase the yaw rate and decrease rotor rpm. The decision to reduce collective must be based on the pilot's assessment of the altitude available for recovery. If the rotation cannot be stopped and ground contact is imminent, an autorotation may be the best course of action. Maintain full left pedal until the rotation stops, then adjust to maintain heading.\" -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The private pilot of the experimental amateur-built, single seat, helicopter departed his home airport, flew to a friend's property, and landed uneventfully. After his visit, the pilot started the helicopter, lifted off, and departed to the southwest. About 1 minute later, his friend observed the helicopter coming toward him in a nose-low attitude, about 400 ft above ground level, and at a \"high rate of speed.\" The helicopter suddenly pitched over, began to tumble, and impacted in an inverted attitude; a postcrash fire ensued. Sound spectrum analysis of a video of the accident flight indicated that the helicopter was flying at an airspeed of at least 83 knots when the loss of control occurred.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot did not possess a rotorcraft helicopter rating. Review of the pilot's logbook revealed entries that indicated the pilot had been endorsed for solo flight in the Robinson R22 and had flown an R22 solo. However, according to the flight instructor who had given the pilot about 21 hours of flight instruction in an R22, he had not endorsed the pilot for solo flight in the R22, and he had observed that the pilot had some \"bad habits\" and would occasionally lose control of the helicopter. It is likely that the pilot made the logbook entries to indicate that he had soloed because they were required by the helicopter kit manufacturer before he could receive a factory checkout of the helicopter, which he had purchased about 6 months before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe factory checkout was conducted on the day before the accident. According to the factory check pilot, during the checkout, the pilot kept making mistakes and advised the check pilot that he was very tired because he had not slept for 2 days due to anticipation of the checkout. Also, during the checkout, the check pilot determined that the weight and balance of the helicopter was not correct, and the pilot would need to fly the helicopter so they could check the position of the cyclic stick during hover. The pilot advised the check pilot that, because of his lack of sleep and nervousness, he did not feel it safe to fly the helicopter that day. As a result, the check pilot reminded him that he would need to check the weight and balance and the position of the cyclic stick during hover before operating the helicopter, since it was not accomplished that day.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage did not reveal evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions of the helicopter or engine that would have precluded normal operation. A piece of angle iron was discovered in the debris field, which, according to the pilot's friend, the pilot had attached to the helicopter's tailboom for weight and balance purposes. However, calculations revealed that the helicopter's center of gravity was outside the forward edge of the weight and balance envelope approved by the kit manufacturer. It is likely that the out of balance condition combined with the high speed of the low-altitude pass resulted in the loss of control.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had therapeutic levels of the antidepressant sertraline in his blood at the time of the accident. Although any psychoactive medications can be impairing, sertraline is not known to directly cause sleepiness or other impairing symptoms. Therefore, it is unlikely that effects from sertraline impaired the pilot. However, sertraline is prescribed for treatment of depression, and major depression itself is associated with significant cognitive degradation, particularly in executive functioning. The cognitive degradation may not improve even with remission of the depressed episode, and patients with severe disease are more significantly affected than those with fewer symptoms or episodes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot demonstrated poor decision-making and executive function when he decided to fly the helicopter without having soloed in the R22 and without adequately addressing the identified issue with the helicopter's weight and balance. Additionally, flying the helicopter at high speed and low altitude further demonstrated his impaired executive function. One month before the accident, the pilot's personal physician described inappropriate demeanor and unkempt appearance; this is the most recent description of the pilot's executive function and further suggests the depression was not well controlled. Therefore, the pilot's depression and resulting degradation of executive function likely contributed to his decision to fly the poorly balanced helicopter in a high-speed, low-altitude maneuver and contributed to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had provided his aviation medical examiner (AME) with a letter from his physician documenting his anxiety/depression as well as its treatment. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidance, depression treated for less than 6 months is disqualifying, and a medical certificate should not have been issued. Therefore, the investigation determined the AME failed to follow FAA guidelines for depression and inappropriately provided the pilot with a medical certificate. The AME forwarded the records of the pilot's depression to the FAA 19 days before the accident; therefore, there was insufficient time for the FAA to identify the issue and recall an improperly issued medical certificate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, the pilot had used diphenhydramine before the accident. Compared to other antihistamines, diphenhydramine causes marked sedation. Altered mood and impaired cognitive and psychomotor performance may also be observed. The diphenhydramine in cavity blood tested by two laboratories was not consistent (0.828 and 2.171 ug/ml), but the results were well above the therapeutic range of 0.0250 to 0.1120 ug/ml. Diphenhydramine undergoes postmortem redistribution, and postmortem central blood levels may increase by about three times with cavity blood levels even higher. However, even divided by seven or eight, the postmortem levels measured suggest that the pilot likely had impairing levels at the time of the accident. Although the pilot had been able to fly the helicopter for a short distance earlier in the day, the subsequent high-speed pass with the helicopter outside of weight and balance specifications required a much higher degree of flight skill to complete safely. Therefore, the pilot's use of diphenhydramine likely degraded his flight skills and contributed to his inability to safely control the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Pilot's Rotorcraft Forum Posts&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was a member of an internet rotorcraft forum and posted regularly. On September 19, 2014, he posted that he had flown the Helicycle about 3 hours that day but still needed the factory check pilot \"to come and help me work out little kinks here and there, but overall the flight was great.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the flight, he noticed that there was \"a little stick shake\" and \"had a problem with belt slippage\" that he attributed to oil leaking from the transmission filter housing onto the belts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe stated that the factory check pilot was going to come out to install new elastomeric bearings on the rotor hub, and he was sure that \"we will balance and tweak everything.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nElastomeric Bearings&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the kit manufacturer, the elastomeric bearings were excluded from the purchase price of a Helicycle kit. The elastomeric bearings, which were part of the Helicycle rotor hub and necessary to operate the helicopter, would be withheld from the kit until the kit was assembled and ready for the customer's factory checkout. The installation of the elastomeric bearings would be performed by an authorized factory test pilot during the factory checkout, and the kit manufacturer reserved the right to withhold the elastomeric bearings until the customer had sufficiently prepared for the factory checkout.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the case of the accident helicopter, the Helicycle had been purchased from a previous owner so it already had the elastomeric bearings installed when the pilot purchased it. On September 27, 2014, the elastomeric bearings were replaced to track and balance the main rotor during the pilot's factory checkout.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nKit Manufacturer's Requirements for Flight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the kit manufacturer, their policy was that customers would agree to have a factory checkout performed on their Helicycle before flight. The factory checkout consisted of a multi-day process during which the Helicycle was \"checked out\" and then test flown by a factory check pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the checkout, the customer also will fly the Helicycle for the first time. The factory checkout would only be scheduled following the receipt of the following items by the kit manufacturer:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- Proof of aircraft registration.&#x0D;\n- Airworthiness certificate.&#x0D;\n- A completed factory checkout checklist.&#x0D;\n- Proof of solo flight in the pilot's logbook.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFactory Checkout&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had contacted the check pilot about 2 months before the accident and advised him that he had purchased a previously owned Helicycle and needed a \"checkout.\" The check pilot advised him that he would be able to do one, but the pilot would have to meet the factory requirements and have a helicopter-rotorcraft certificate or an endorsement for solo in a Robinson R22 helicopter. The pilot advised him that he had not soloed yet but was working on it.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot later contacted the check pilot and stated that he had received an endorsement for solo in the Robinson R22 helicopter. As such, the check pilot made arrangements to do the checkout at M33 where the pilot had a hangar where he kept the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 27, 2014, the check pilot met the pilot at M33. Per the check pilot's instructions, the pilot had not installed the main rotor blades on the helicopter as he needed them off the helicopter to make it easier to install the new elastomeric bearings in the rotor head.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe check pilot and the pilot installed the new bearings and then re-installed the rotor blades. Before they began the dynamic balancing of the rotor system, the check pilot reviewed the preflight check with the pilot. According to the check pilot, the checklist was similar to most helicopters where you check mechanical components, control linkages, and control operation. During the review, he showed and explained to the pilot how to check all the items on the checklist. They next attached a dynamic rotor blade balancer to the helicopter, rolled the helicopter out of the hangar, and began balancing the main rotor blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the blade balancing, the pilot was in the helicopter and was in charge of starting the helicopter, engaging the blades, and running the helicopter up to flight speed, so that balance readings could be taken. (Balancing is done on the ground not in the air.) The check pilot noticed that the pilot was having trouble remembering the correct starting procedure, kept referring to a start procedure that he had printed up to help him, but still kept making mistakes. The pilot told the check pilot that he was very tired because he had not slept for 2 days due to the anticipation of having the checkout done.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThey performed about seven starts and shutdowns before the dynamic balancing was complete. They then removed the balancing equipment. In the paperwork from the previous owner, the pilot found a weight and balance sheet that showed the helicopter was balanced for a 200-pound (lbs) pilot. Because there was a difference between the check pilot's weight (180 lbs) and the pilot's stated weight of 200 lbs, they added 10 lbs of ballast weight on the floor of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNext, they rolled the helicopter out to the taxiway. The check pilot then started the helicopter and began to do some hover testing, vibration level testing, and handling tests. He hovered for about 10 minutes and then began hover taxiing, followed by forward take offs and landings, with several runs up to a cruise speed of 90 to 100 mph, then more hovering and hover taxiing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter landing, he spoke to the pilot about him flying the helicopter. The pilot said that because of his lack of sleep and nervousness, he did not feel safe to fly the helicopter that day, so they rolled the helicopter back into the hanger. The check pilot explained that because the pilot was not able to fly the helicopter that day, the pilot would later need to check the weight and balance of the helicopter. He explained to the pilot that he would need to pull into a hover and check the position of the cyclic stick. Ideal position was 1- to 1 ½-inches rearward and no more than 2 inches. If the stick was close to 2 inches, he would need to move the battery to the rear or add a counterbalance weight to the tail boom. The pilot said that he thought it would be easier to add a weight than move the battery. The check pilot then explained to him that if weight was needed, he should start out with a 2 to 3 lbs, round bar of steel or lead fastened to the center of the tail boom with Adel clamps. The pilot should hover, then check the cyclic stick position, and then move the weight fore or aft depending on the cyclic stick position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe check pilot also explained to the pilot that if the cyclic was too far back, the helicopter was nose heavy and needed more weight to the rear. If the cyclic was too far forward, then it was tail heavy, and he would need to decrease the amount of weight or move the weight forward.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThey discussed what the pilot's next steps should be. The check pilot suggested that the pilot get more training before he flew his helicopter, and, when he was more confident flying, he should start out with hover practicing for at least 5 hours before flying the helicopter to altitude and to stay at the airport. He also suggested that the pilot keep his speed down to 70 to 80 mph for practice takeoffs and landings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHelicopter Flying Handbook&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA's Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21A), it is vital to comply with weight and balance limits established for helicopters. Operating above the maximum weight limitation compromises the structural integrity of the helicopter and adversely affects performance. Balance is also critical because, on some fully loaded helicopters, center of gravity (CG) deviations as small as 3 inches can dramatically change a helicopter's handling characteristics.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIdeally, a pilot should try to balance a helicopter perfectly so that the fuselage remains horizontal in hovering flight, with no cyclic pitch control needed except for wind correction. Since the fuselage acts as a pendulum suspended from the rotor, changing the CG changes the angle at which the aircraft hangs from the rotor. When the CG is directly under the rotor mast, the helicopter hangs horizontally; if the CG is too far forward of the mast, the helicopter hangs with its nose tilted down; if the CG is too far aft of the mast, the nose tilts up.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA forward CG may occur when a heavy pilot and passenger take off \"without baggage or proper ballast located aft of the rotor mast.\" This situation becomes worse if the fuel tanks are located aft of the rotor mast because as fuel burns the CG continues to shift forward.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of Weight and Balance Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of weight and balance data supplied by the kit manufacturer indicated that the center of gravity of the Helicycle was dependent on the pilot's weight, installed position of the battery, and position and weight of any ballast installed. According to the manufacturer-supplied operator manual for the Helicycle, the \"safe flight CG window\" was 99 1/4 inches to 99 3/4 inches and \"must be substantiated by a hang test.\" The operator manual included a note that stated, \"the relative narrowness of the Helicycle fore and aft CG limit is extremely difficult to arrive at by calculation and must be substantiated by a hang test and later by an in-flight cyclic stick position measurement.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCalculations based on the manufacturer-supplied weight and balance data, weight and balance sheet from the previous owner, weight of the pilot, weight of the angle iron (about 1 lb), and location of the angle iron on the Helicycle's tailboom, which was determined from the videos taken of the accident flight, revealed that:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- The Helicycle's center of gravity was outside of the forward edge of the kit manufacturer's approved envelope.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- The imbalance was the result of the pilot's actual weight (211 lbs) being 11 lbs more than the weight of the previous owner (200 lbs) and 21 lbs more than the weight of the check pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- The angle iron attached to the tailboom of the Helicycle by the pilot only accounted for 46% of the imbalance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- A weight of about 2 lbs (about twice the weight of the angle iron), would have been required to balance the Helicycle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe kit manufacturer advised that the starting point of achieving a finely balanced Helicycle was to start with a \"hang test.\" During the test, the balance would be adjusted until a 3.25-degree forward tilt of the main rotor was achieved. This adjustment did not represent the end of the balancing process. The final step required in fine tuning the balance was to analyze and adjust the cyclic position in hover until the proper cyclic position was achieved. This final step however was not accomplished by the pilot prior to the accident flight. - The Helicycle was a single-seat, experimental amateur-built helicopter. It was equipped with a two-blade, semi-rigid main rotor and was powered by a Solar T62-32, 150 shaft horsepower, turboshaft engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor was fully harmonized, and the flight control system included a modulated collective pitch system. The helicopter was also equipped with elastomeric thrust bearings, control friction devices, and an electronic throttle control.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA records, the helicopter was issued a special airworthiness certificate on October 6, 2008, after it had been assembled from a kit. It was purchased by the pilot on March 10, 2014.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to maintenance records, the helicopter's most recent condition inspection was completed on May 5, 2011. At the time of accident, the helicopter had accrued about 51 total hours of operation. - The helicopter was not equipped with a cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder, nor was it required to be by federal regulations. However, a camcorder that was being operated by the pilot's friend whose property the accident occurred on captured most of the liftoff and accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFive files from the camcorder were provided to the NTSB. Each file contained video and audio of the helicopter on the day of the accident; however, only two of the five files were used by investigators. (The remaining three files did not have sufficient content for analysis.) The audio was extracted from each file at its native sample rate of 48,000 kHz and converted to a mono wave file for sound spectrum analysis.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe first video, which was 26 seconds long, captured the pilot seated inside the helicopter with the engine powered on at the start of the video with the observer directly facing the helicopter. The helicopter began a hover from standstill at 8 seconds and then started moving forward 4 seconds later. The helicopter flew past the observer at 21 seconds and continued off into the distance. Only the last 12 seconds of this file were used for sound spectrum analysis.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe second video, which was 11 seconds long, captured the helicopter coming towards the observer from a distance. The helicopter was heard passing by the camera when the camera panned out at 6 seconds. An unidentified sound was heard, and the camera panned back to the helicopter at 8 seconds and showed the helicopter descending in an inverted attitude until impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA spectrogram was generated for the extracted audio track of each file. The frequencies associated with the turbine and main rotor rpm were identified from the first file and used as a baseline of analysis for second file. Doppler effect was present in the first file and was used to calculate airspeed during forward flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEvaluation of Takeoff&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor frequency was determined to be 20.3 Hz, which resulted in a main rotor rpm of about 615 rpm. This value remained constant before and after passing the observer. The speed of the helicopter as it passed the observer was estimated to be 33 knots. The frequencies identified were consistent with a normal takeoff under takeoff power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEvaluation of Event&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the second video, the airspeed was determined to be about 83 knots. The orientation between the observer and the helicopter could not be established; therefore, the actual airspeed may have been higher than calculated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor frequency was determined to be between 20.3 Hz and 23.3 Hz, which resulted in a main rotor rpm of about 699 rpm at its peak. The ratio of the calculated rpm to the nominal main rotor rpm (from the first video) was 113%. - On September 28, 2014, about 1520 central daylight time, an experimental amateur-built Eagle R &amp; D Helicycle helicopter, N7062U, impacted terrain after a loss of control while maneuvering in Gallatin, Tennessee. The private pilot was fatally injured and the helicopter was substantially damaged. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the personal flight conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The flight departed from a private residence about 1519 and was destined for Sumner County Regional Airport (M33), Gallatin, Tennessee.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a friend of the pilot, the pilot had departed M33 earlier in the day and flown to the friend's property. The landing was uneventful, and, while the pilot was there, he borrowed some tools and increased the tension on the helicopter's drive belts. According to the friend, about 1519, the pilot started the helicopter, lifted off, and departed to the southwest. The friend assumed that the pilot was heading back to M33, but, about 1 minute later, he observed the helicopter flying toward him in a nose-low attitude, about 400 ft above ground level, and at a \"high rate of speed.\" The helicopter then suddenly pitched over, began to tumble, and impacted in an inverted attitude, and a postcrash fire ensued. - According to the FAA medical certification file, at the time of the pilot's most recent FAA medical certification examination on August 19, 2014, he reported high blood pressure treated with benazepril, a prescription high blood pressure medication that is marketed as Lotensin. He reported no other chronic medical conditions or medications to the aviation medical examiner (AME).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AME noted no side effects or complications from the high blood pressure, identified no abnormal physical findings on examination, and issued a third class medical certificate with the following limitation: must have available glasses for near vision.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1 month before the accident, the AME forwarded a letter written by the pilot's primary care provider to the FAA Medical Certification Division as part of the medical certification package. In this letter, which was dated 2 days after the medical certificate was issued, the pilot's primary care provider noted his elevated blood pressure and recommended lifestyle modifications and continued use of benazepril with hydrochlorothiazide. Benazepril with hydrochlorothiazide is a combination prescription medication used to treat high blood pressure that is marketed as Lotensin HCT. Additionally, the letter noted that the pilot appeared disheveled, was agitated and fidgety, and his mood was described as very anxious and irritable. The primary care provider had diagnosed longstanding anxiety/depression and prescribed vilazodone, a medication used to treat major depression that is marketed as Viibryd. Vilazodone carries a warning regarding increased risk of suicide in adolescents and young adults.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDepression is a disqualifying condition for pilot medical certification, and, according to the Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners, an aviation medical examiner should not issue a medical certificate to a depressed pilot. The FAA will consider a special issuance of a medical certificate for depression after 6 months of treatment if the applicant is clinically stable on one of four approved medications; vilazodone is not one of these medications.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutopsy&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Nashville Tennessee Office of the Medical Examiner autopsy report, the cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries. No significant natural disease was identified.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing on specimens from the pilot was conducted at the FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The specimens were negative for carbon monoxide, cyanide, ethanol, and basic, acidic, and neutral drugs, with the exception of diphenhydramine and sertraline, which were detected in liver and blood. Diphenhydramine was detected in cavity blood (2.171 ug/ml) and liver. Additionally, sertraline was detected in cavity blood (0.101 ug/ml) and liver, and its metabolite desmethylsertraline was also detected in blood and liver. According to an email to the NTSB medical officer dated May 23, 2016, the FAA's laboratory testing would not identify vilazodone. Aegis Crimes Laboratory toxicology testing performed as part of the medical examiner's death investigation identified 0.828 ug/ml of diphenhydramine in cavity blood.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDiphenhydramine is a sedating antihistamine used to treat allergy symptoms and as a sleep aid. It is available over the counter under the trade names Benadryl and Unisom. Diphenhydramine's accepted therapeutic range is from 0.0250 to 0.1120 ug/ml, and it carries the following FDA warning: may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Compared to other antihistamines, diphenhydramine causes marked sedation; it is also classed as a central nervous system depressant, and this is the rationale for its use as a sleep aid. Altered mood and impaired cognitive and psychomotor performance may also be observed. In a driving simulator study, a single dose of diphenhydramine impaired driving ability more than a blood alcohol concentration of 0.100 percent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSertraline is a prescription medication used to treat several conditions including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder; it is marketed as Zoloft. Sertraline carries a warning regarding increased risk of suicide in adolescents and young adults. The accepted therapeutic range is from 0.0100 to 0.2000 ug/ml. - At 1553, the reported weather at Nashville International Airport (BNA), Nashville Tennessee, located 21 nautical miles southwest of the accident site included: calm winds, 10 miles visibility, scattered clouds at 4,200 ft, broken clouds at 6,000 ft, temperature 26° C, dew point 16° C, and an altimeter setting of 30.08 inches of mercury. - Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Pilot Records&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA records, the pilot was first certificated in 1973 and held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land. The pilot owned a Cessna 150, and although he also owned an experimental amateur-built Bensen B-8M gyrocopter, and the Helicycle, he did not possess a rotorcraft gyroplane rating or rotorcraft helicopter rating. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on August 19, 2014. He reported on that date that he had accrued about 1,200 total flight hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the pilot's logbook indicated that he had received 21.3 total hours of dual instruction in a Robinson R22 helicopter. The last entry in the logbook was dated August 14, 2014, and showed 1.0 hours in the dual instruction column and 0.5 hours in the pilot-in-command column. The entry also showed 1.5 hours in the columns for day flight and total duration of flight, and it appeared that the number \"5\" in these two entries had been written over. The word \"solo\" had been written in the remarks column to the left of the instructor's entry for the flight, and the handwriting of the word appeared to be different than the handwriting of the instructor's entry.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of endorsements in the pilot's logbook showed that the handwriting in the pilot's \"Initial Solo Endorsement\" for the R22 was different from the handwriting in the pilot's 49 CFR 1552.3 (h) and Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 73 Awareness endorsements. The date of his initial solo endorsement in the R22 was August 4, 2014, but there was no flight time entry for that date.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight Training&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the flight instructor who provided helicopter flight instruction to the pilot in the Robinson R22, they flew a total of about 21 hours together between March 31, 2014, and August 15, 2014.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll flights were conducted in an R22 helicopter. The instructor stated that he never endorsed the pilot's logbook to authorize solo flight in a helicopter. The flight instructor added that he had no contact with the pilot after their last flight together on August 15, 2014. He was unaware of any past or planned flight attempts in the Helicycle, although he knew the pilot had purchased it.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the flight lessons, the flight instructor observed what he considered to be the pilot's \"bad habits\" on several maneuvers, which he believed originated from the pilot's gyrocopter and airplane experience. The pilot would also occasionally lose control of the helicopter while hovering and during maneuvers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter each instructional flight, the flight instructor reviewed the flight lesson with the pilot and discussed with him his negative habits and instances of loss of control as they worked to improve his helicopter piloting skills. In their discussions, the flight instructor told the pilot that his skills were not yet sufficient for solo flight, including flight in his Helicycle. - Examination of the accident site and wreckage revealed that, during the impact sequence, the helicopter first made ground contact with the forward portion of the cockpit. It then tumbled along the ground on a magnetic heading of about 030° for about 90 ft before coming to rest on its left side.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation of the engine. Examination of the helicopter's structure and flight control system did not reveal evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions which would have precluded normal operation of the flight control system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA piece of angle iron was discovered in the debris field along with numerous broken cable ties. Review of the helicopter manufacturer's published information did not indicate that it was part of either the helicopter's structure or drive train. According to the pilot's friend, he observed that the piece of angle iron was attached to the helicopter when the pilot landed and took off from his property. He said that the pilot had attached it to the helicopter's tail boom for weight and balance purposes. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was conducting agricultural spray operations in a helicopter. He had sprayed three fields earlier in the day and was en route to the next field when the accident occurred. Witnesses reported observing the helicopter heading north and then colliding with a suspended static line. The helicopter subsequently pitched up, descended, and impacted terrain. Larger transmission lines were located above the smaller static lines. A witness who was about 1/4 mile from the accident site stated that he could see the larger transmission lines but that he did not see the smaller static lines until the helicopter struck one of them. He also stated that it did not appear that the pilot took any evasive action to avoid the line. A postaccident examination of the helicopter did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "DynaNav DynaFlight AirAg-E&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a DynaNav DynaFlight AirAg-E, which was a GPS based guidance and mapping system that aided in the application of seeds, fertilizers, and chemicals to a treatment area. Data was recorded and stored on a compact flash drive inside the device and could be transferred via the USB port. The data was sampled at 10 times per second but not stored at that rate. The storage rate was determined by an algorithm based on the dynamics of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUpon arrival at the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory, an exterior examination revealed that the unit had sustained moderate impact damage from the accident. The compact flash card read out normally and the data was extracted. The read out resulted in a file which was converted to a Google Earth file using manufacturer's software.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe data extracted included 23 sessions from June 7, 2013, through September 6, 2014. The accident flight was recorded starting 17:03:12 universal coordinated time (UTC) and ending 17:07:19 UTC on September 6, 2014.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe data showed the helicopter moving northeast at the beginning of the flight, then moving further to the west as the last data point was captured. During the flight, crops were sprayed in certain areas and then the pilot proceeded to the north. The data revealed that the helicopter was flying between 1,142 ft and 1,342 ft MSL during the operation. Due to buffering, the data recording may have ended before the accident event.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe final recorded points showed the helicopter headed north and in a slight descent from the last recorded point at 1,255 ft MSL; about 88 ft above the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe GPS report and tabular data can be found in the docket associated with this accident report. - The aircraft was a Robinson R44 II single engine light helicopter with a skid landing gear. It was manufactured in 2004. The helicopter had a semi-rigid two-bladed main rotor system and a two-bladed tail rotor which were driven by a 205-horsepower Lycoming IO-540 reciprocating engine. The engine had accumulated 308 total hours and 2 hours since the last inspection. On August 25, 2014, a 100-hour inspection was completed at an airframe total time of 1,183 hours. The helicopter was outfitted for agricultural spray operations. - On September 6, 2014, at 1207 central daylight time, a Robinson R44 II helicopter, N699TQ, impacted a suspended static line near Macedonia, Iowa. The pilot was fatally injured and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to Mills County Choppers, Inc. and operated by Johnson Helicopter Services under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 as an aerial application flight. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident and no flight plan was filed. The local flight originated at an unknown time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was about ½ mile from the accident site, reported he heard the helicopter prior to seeing it. He added that the helicopter was flying north, continued into the suspended lines, pitched up and then descended toward the ground. He observed fuel leaking from the helicopter at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother witness, who was about ¼ mile away, stated that the helicopter was flying north at a height above the larger transmission lines and it did not appear that the pilot made any evasive action to avoid the lines. From his location he could not see the smaller static line until the helicopter contacted it. He then observed the static line stretch to the north with the helicopter until it broke and the helicopter impacted the ground. There were no sparks or fire observed during the impact. He did not hear any unusual sounds from the helicopter's engine until the wire strike, and then it sounded like a \"lawn mower going over a rock.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPower line maintenance employees stated that at the time of the accident the larger transmission lines were not energized. The smaller line that was struck by the helicopter was referred to as a static line and did not transmit electrical current. It was composed of seven strands of high strength steel and measured 3/8 inch thick. The tower structures that suspended the lines were 111 feet tall and were 1,650 feet apart. The estimated distance between the higher static lines and the lower transmission lines was 25 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's spraying partner, they intended to spray from 1100 to 1800. The partner, the accident pilot, and the operator all sat together and completed paperwork for about two hours in preparation for the spaying they intended to accomplish that day. He stated that the field sprayed by the pilot prior to the accident was the fourth field of the day. Prior to that spray flight, he loaded the helicopter with 30 gallons of applicant and filled it with fuel. He stated that everything was going well that day and the pilot did not mention any issues with the helicopter. He drove about 17 miles (30 minutes) to meet the pilot at the next location; the helicopter had already crashed when he arrived. He had worked with the pilot for 3 years and stated it was strange that there was no radio communication during the drive to the next location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA GPS receiver was recovered from the accident site and was sent to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Vehicle Recorder Laboratory for download. - The pilot initially survived the accident and was hospitalized; however, on September 11, 2014, the pilot died as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident. On September 13, 2014, an autopsy was performed at the Douglas County Morgue, Omaha, Nebraska. The cause of death was attributed to multiple blunt force injuries to the chest and abdomen.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn October 29, 2014, the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute completed a final forensic toxicology fatal accident report on the specimens from the pilot; the toxicology was negative. - At 1215, the automated weather observation at the Council Bluffs Municipal Airport (CBF), located 11 miles west-northwest of the accident site reported: wind from 080° at 4 knots; visibility 10 miles; sky condition clear; temperature 66° F; dew point 50° F; and barometric pressure 30.30 inches of mercury. - The pilot, age 26, held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter. He also held a flight instructor certificate for the same. On February 27, 2014, the pilot was issued a first class Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) medical certificate with no limitations. On the application for the medical certificate, he reported his flight experience as 1,500 total flight hours and 100 hours in the preceding six months. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the pilot's flight experience included over 1,522 total rotorcraft flight hours and over 1,084 hours in the accident helicopter make and model. The pilot had accumulated over 109 hours in the preceding 90 days and over 20 hours in the preceding 30 days, all of which were in the accident helicopter make and model. - The responding FAA inspector examined the wreckage, which was located at GPS coordinates 41° 10' 57.2\" N / 95° 32' 07.3\" W, and at an elevation of 1,202 ft mean sea level (MSL). The accident area consisted of a group of multiple cultivated agricultural fields in one mile squares. The fields were terraced and had descending slopes from west to east. Several power lines ran east to west and intersected the intended spray field and the field that contained the wreckage. The power lines were mounted on 111-ft tall metal towers and consisted of three larger transmission lines beneath two static lines. The lines slightly drooped down between each tower. Due to the slight droop, the actual height of the static line prior to the accident was unknown. The northern static line was found broken and lying on the ground; the other lines appeared intact. The broken static line exhibited signatures consistent with tension overload. The distance from the lines to the accident site was 240 ft on a north heading.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage consisted of the helicopter fuselage, tail boom and tail rotor system. The main rotor system was separated from the helicopter and came to rest about 75 feet north of the main wreckage. The main rotor blades were damaged, but generally straight. One main rotor blade contained a distinct cut near the blade hub. The cut began on the leading edge and extended inboard toward the blade hub.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA inspector also examined the helicopter wreckage after it was removed from the field and relocated to the owner's farm. The helicopter showed evidence of multiple structural failures, which was consistent with impact with a wire and terrain. The passenger area was damaged and significantly compressed. The engine compartment was also damaged and compressed. The tail boom remained attached, but was bent toward the nose of the helicopter to facilitate the wreckage transport. Flight control continuity could not be confirmed due to the extensive damage. The application storage tank was broken open. The instrument panel showed impact damage, but remained intact. The Kollsman window in the altimeter read 29.94. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and passenger were inspecting a span of high-tension powerlines for damage after a recent storm. Recorded data showed that the helicopter departed and proceeded along the left side of the span at an altitude roughly consistent with the height of the suspended wires. The helicopter's last recorded position was about 400 ft laterally and about 25 ft below the point where it ultimately contacted and severed the uppermost wire of the span, which was about 150 ft above ground level. The severed wire was located on the right side of the span, whereas the helicopter was flying on the left. The helicopter's ground track transitioned from left to right and back across the span near transmission towers earlier during the flight; however, there were no transmission towers located in the immediate vicinity of the accident site. Portions of the wreckage came to rest directly below the severed wire, and oriented along a debris path to the right of and along the helicopter's previous direction of travel. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any mechanical malfunctions or failures before the helicopter contacted the wire.",
    "FactualNarrative": "A handheld GPS receiver was recovered from the wreckage and forwarded to the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory for examination and data recovery. The unit sustained major impact damage to the screen and casing. The memory chip was located after an interior inspection and a chip-level recovery was performed. The data were successfully obtained from the memory chip. The accident flight was identified by 181 data points spanning between 1030:46 and 1100:46, with one data point recorded every 10 seconds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the data, the helicopter departed from TCL at 1034 and proceeded east before intercepting the north/south oriented powerline span about 1040, and proceeding north. The helicopter maintained approximate GPS groundspeeds between 30 and 60 knots, GPS altitudes between 300 and 700 feet, and generally flew on the west (left) side of the powerlines. The ground track briefly slowed and transitioned to the east (right) of the powerlines on two occasions, about 1047 and 1058. Both of the transitions occurred roughly at points along the powerlines where transmission towers were present. At 1100:26, the calculated GPS groundspeed was 32 knots, and the GPS altitude was 467 feet, or about 120 feet agl. The next recorded position, at 1100:36, placed the helicopter at 33 knots GPS groundspeed, 522 feet GPS altitude, and about 125 feet agl. The final recorded position, at 1100:46, recorded a GPS groundspeed of 32 knots, 537 feet GPS altitude, or about 164 feet agl. This position was roughly 410 feet north of transmission tower 82.  The helicopter's tail rotor was recovered about 400 feet northeast of the final recorded GPS position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFigure 1 – Accident Site Diagram Depicting GPS Flight Path and Helicopter Wreckage - According to FAA airworthiness records, the accident helicopter was manufactured in 1990, and was powered by a Rolls-Royce 250-C20B turboshaft engine. A review of the helicopter's maintenance records revealed that its most recent annual/100-hour inspection was completed on August 4, 2014, and at that time the helicopter had accumulated 3,765 total hours. The helicopter had accumulated 59 hours since its most recent inspection. - On August 19, 2014, about 1100 central daylight time, a McDonnell Douglas 369E, N444RS, owned and operated by Rotorworks LLC, was substantially damaged when it impacted a utility wire and terrain while maneuvering near Northport, Alabama. The commercial pilot and the passenger were fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a company flight plan was filed for the local flight, which originated from Tuscaloosa Regional Airport (TCL), Tuscaloosa, Alabama, about 1034. The aerial observation flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, on the morning of the accident flight, the pilot was requested to relocate the helicopter from Mobile, Alabama, to Tuscaloosa. Once in Tuscaloosa, the pilot fueled the helicopter and picked up the passenger/observer before departing on the accident flight; the purpose of which was to inspect a span of high-tension power lines for damage from a storm that had passed through the area the previous night.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1025, the pilot submitted a company flight plan via email, and according to satellite tracking data, departed TCL about 1034. The helicopter's location, altitude, groundspeed, and direction of travel were subsequently reported to the operator every 5 minutes, as it initially flew east, intercepted the powerline span to be inspected, and then proceeded north along the span. The helicopter's final position, as reported by the satellite tracking data, was recorded at 1100, at a GPS altitude of 457 feet, a groundspeed of 32 knots, and a track of 27 degrees true. At that time, the helicopter was positioned over the western edge of the easement through which the powerlines ran.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1130, the power company contacted the operator and reported an additional fault with the transmission lines the accident helicopter was tasked with inspecting, and believed that the fault may be associated with the helicopter. The operator subsequently began a search for the helicopter and provided its last known position to local law enforcement. The accident site was located by air about 1/4-mile northeast of helicopter's last reported position. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot by the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences, Montgomery, Alabama. The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing performed by the FAA's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute found no trace of ethanol or other drugs present in the samples submitted for the pilot. - The 1053 weather conditions reported at TCL, located about 18 nautical miles southwest of the accident site, included wind from 260 degrees at 5 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, a temperature of 30 degrees C, a dew point of 22 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.97 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the sun's angle was about 57 degrees above the horizon at an azimuth of about 122 degrees. - According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airman records, the pilot, age 51, held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter, airplane multiengine land, instrument airplane, and instrument helicopter. He also held a private pilot certificate with a rating for airplane single engine land. The pilot was issued an FAA first-class medical certificate on January 21, 2014 with no waivers or limitations. According to the operator, he had accumulated 13,500 total hours of flight experience, of which 12,860 were in rotorcraft. He had accumulated 160 total hours of experience in the 90 days preceding the accident, and overall had accumulated 1,500 hours of experience in the accident helicopter make and model. He completed his most recent flight review in February 2014. - The accident site was located along the eastern edge of the powerline easement, which was oriented roughly north-south along uneven terrain in a shallow valley between two transmission towers. The transmission towers were identified as 81 and 82, and were located north and south of the accident site, respectively. A 6-gauge, 3-strand aluminum shield wire about 0.35 inches in diameter, which spanned between the two towers on their eastern side, was severed about 775 feet north of tower 82. The shield wire's estimated height above ground level at that point along the span was about 150 feet. The remaining fiber optic cable and three power transmission phase cables appeared undamaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter fuselage came to rest inverted within a creek bed, just outside and east of the easement, in a forested area. The helicopter's static mast, main rotor hub, and four of the five main rotor blades were separated from the fuselage, along with the aft portion of the tailboom. The remaining main rotor blade separated from the main rotor hub at the strap pack. The main rotor blades exhibited extensive damage which varied in severity and included fractures, gouges, bent spars, cord-wise wrinkling, leading/ trailing edge damage, bending, separation and indications of a wire strike. All of the separated components were located within about 90 feet of the fuselage, and in the general vicinity of the severed shield wire, with the aft portion of the tailboom coming to rest nearly directly below the break point of the shield wire. The wreckage displayed no evidence of a pre- or post-impact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter exhibited extensive damage to the main airframe structural members, static mast support structure and center beam. The static mast was separated at the mast base by fractures near the mast base attachment points. The forward fuselage, including the door and canopy frames, cockpit, and instrument panel were also damaged. All of the canopy windscreens were broken. The cockpit compartment was compromised from ground impact. Both sides of the cockpit and cabin floors were crushed, bent and distorted. Examination of the cockpit seat belts and shoulder harnesses revealed that they functioned normally. All cockpit and cabin doors were installed, and a single set of flight controls was installed at the pilot's position in the left front seat. The pilot was wearing a helmet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft boom fairing exhibited crushed, dented and torn exterior skin surfaces. The air inlet fairing was separated near its mounting base, and exhibited relatively uniform separation surfaces on both of the separated portions. The tailboom was fractured into three pieces, with the first fractured near fuselage station (FS) 200, in the area of the FS 197 mounting frame, with no apparent damage to the mounting bolts. The second section was fractured around FS 258, and exhibited concave depressions consistent in size with the main rotor profile. The third section contained the tail rotor gearbox, tail rotor assembly, vertical and horizontal stabilizers. The horizontal stabilizer and vertical stabilizers sustained various degrees of impact damage to the frame structures, leading edges and exterior skin surfaces. There was no visible indication that the shield wire made contact with the tailboom, empennage, tail rotor, or either of the helicopter's two installed wire strike protection devices.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main transmission rotated freely, contained oil, and the chip detectors were inspected and found clean of magnetic particles. Drive continuity from the transmission to the tail rotor output pinion was present. The main rotor transmission mounting points had visible damage to the main transmission housing mounting bores and mounting studs. The main rotor transmission output splines and mating splines on the main rotor driveshaft were visibly damaged from the separation of the main rotor static mast. The engine-to-transmission drive shaft had fractured in apparent overload. The shaft fractured immediately forward of the aft flexible coupling. The coupling exhibited bending damage, but remained intact. The over-running clutch operated normally. The oil cooler blower assembly mounting bracket and scroll was impact-damaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor gearbox and tail rotor assembly appeared undamaged. The gearbox was mounted securely to the FS 281 frame, contained oil, and rotated freely. There were no metallic chips on the chip detector. The tail rotor swashplate rotated smoothly. The tail rotor driveshaft fractures corresponded to the damaged tailboom. Both the forward and aft tail rotor driveshaft couplings appeared undamaged. The tail rotor blades, pitch links, hub, fork, fork bolt and elastomeric teetering bearings appeared undamaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were fractures, bends and distortion throughout the flight controls. Control continuity was verified for the collective, cyclic and tail rotor controls with all control discontinuities displaying impact-related damage consistent with overload separation. The pilot's cockpit controls and under the seat routed controls were extensively damaged. The lateral and longitudinal actuators were removed and inspected. Both actuator shafts were found near the approximate mid-points of their travel. Damage and fractures to the upper controls including the control rods, pitch links, rotating and stationary swashplates displayed signatures consistent with overload separation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained inside its cowling and all but the right forward engine mounts were fractured. The engine compressor exhibited foreign object damage consistent with ingestion of small, hard-body and soft-body foreign objects during engine operation. Wood debris, pine needles and leaves were ingested deep into the compressor. Most compressor blades exhibited leading edge impact marks and bending in the opposite direction of normal engine rotation. Borescope inspection of the compressor revealed no evidence of blade/vane failure or release. The composite liner within the compressor was intact and exhibited no evidence of erosion or blade tip rub. Rotation of the compressor (N1) was smooth, with some binding caused by ingested evergreen and hardwood debris. N1 continuity was established from the compressor through the gearbox to the starter/generator. Rotation of the power turbine (N2) was also smooth, with no binding or unusual noise. Continuity from N2 to the power output shaft was established.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to extensive airframe damage, control continuity could not be established from the collective and twist grip to the engine. However, both the fuel control unit and power turbine governor were undamaged. The control arms for both units moved freely, with no binding or abnormal resistance. The airframe-mounted fuel cutoff valve was in the OPEN position. Due to cockpit damage, the valve could not be closed from the cockpit. The valve control arm was disconnected from the cockpit control cable, and then moved to the SHUT position. The valve operated easily, with no unusual binding. The fuel supply line to the fuel-flow totalizer was removed; the line contained approximately 2 teaspoons of fuel, which was clean and bright with no observable particulate matter. The fuel line from the totalizer to the fuel spray nozzle was removed and contained approximately 1 teaspoon of clean fuel. The fuel spray nozzle was removed and examined; the spray face displayed normal carbon sooting and was otherwise unremarkable. The nozzle was disassembled, revealing the internal finger filter. The filter was free of debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRemoval of the fuel spray nozzle allowed access to visually examine the gas generator turbine and combustion sections via borescope. Borescope inspection of the gas-generator turbine revealed no evidence of operational damage or failure, nor evidence of thermal damage or erosion. The 1st stage turbine blades appeared to be in good condition, with no impact marks or thermal erosion. Manual rotation of the compressor resulted in corresponding rotation of the gas generator turbine. The combustion section exhibited no evidence of abnormal combustion, streaking, or asymmetric flame pattern. The combustion liner was intact, with no signs of cracking or degradation. Borescope inspection of the power turbine revealed no evidence of operational failure or malfunction. The bleed valve was checked by hand for proper operation, and operated smoothly by hand, with no lateral play of the poppet valve.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOil was present in the engine's auxiliary gearbox and the airframe-mounted oil reservoir. The oil was clean with no abnormal odor, entrained water, or observable particulate matter. Both the upper and lower magnetic chip detectors were absent of ferrous metal. The engine-mounted oil filter was removed and examined. No contamination of the filter was present and the oil within the filter bowl was clean.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was conducting an agricultural application flight in the helicopter and had just completed spraying a field. A witness near the accident site reported that he saw the helicopter flying low and then pass a tree line when a wind gust lifted the helicopter up and to the left directly into power lines. Weather conditions reported at an airport in the area included wind at 16 knots gusting to 21 knots at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeparated power lines were observed near the accident site, and a witness mark was melted into the leading edged of a main rotor blade, consistent with it contacting a power line. Recorded GPS data were consistent with low-altitude operations near the accident site. Based on the evidence, it is likely that, while the pilot was flying low-altitude operations in gusting wind conditions, he failed to maintain adequate clearance from power lines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing detected the sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine in the pilot's urine and in his heart blood. Although some degree of impairment from diphenhydramine cannot be completely ruled out, the pilot's behavior on the day of the accident, as evidenced by GPS data that shows he flew straight lines and made good coverage of the fields during the spraying, was consistent with his level of skill and experience. Therefore, it is unlikely that the pilot's impairment from diphenhydramine contributed to the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "N7089J was a Bell 47G-5 helicopter, with serial number 25032. The helicopter was manufactured in 1971 and was issued a normal category airworthiness certificate. The helicopter's type certificate data sheet indicated it seated two and had a maximum gross weight of 2,850 pounds. The helicopter was configured for agriculture and pest control and a restricted category airworthiness certificate was issued on May 17, 2012. The last helicopter annual inspection was conducted on April 2, 2014. At the time of that inspection, the helicopter had a total time of 13,270.4 hours. - The accident helicopter was equipped with an AgNav Guia P152 GPS, with serial number 152110418. This GPS was a compact device, which could provide the pilot with customizable agricultural spray application data on a color, moving map. The GPS had a 6.5-inch display and was enclosed in a ruggedized housing. The moving map could display a customizable interface, which allowed the pilot to monitor application information and navigational landmarks. The device could interface with an agricultural \"light bar\" that provided directional guidance to the pilot as per user defined aerial application position information. The device had an obstacle warning feature, which was compatible with FAA tower obstacle data and could provide the pilot with warnings regarding incoming obstacles via messages and alarms. - On August 12, 2014, about 1045 central daylight time, a Bell 47G-5 helicopter, N7089J, impacted a powerline and terrain near Mansfield, Illinois. The pilot, who was the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. The helicopter sustained substantial damage. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Reynolds Aerial Service LLC under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 as an aerial application flight. Day visual flight rules conditions prevailed for the flight, which did not operate on a flight plan. The local flight originated from Mansfield, Illinois, at time unknown.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who lived near the accident site, reported that he noticed the agricultural application helicopter flying at a low altitude. He said that the helicopter cleared the tree line on the west side of his property. In his statement, he, in part, stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nI looked up and [saw] him flying from the north east to the south west&#x0D;\nover my property and when it passed the tree line on the west side of&#x0D;\nmy property the air craft was [taken] by a gust of wind which hit the&#x0D;\nright side of the air craft and jerked it up and to the left [directly] into&#x0D;\nthe power lines that are south west of my house and that is when he hit&#x0D;\nthe top line with the left long extension spray boom where chemicals&#x0D;\nare sprayed from and caused the air craft to flip upside down. I called 911&#x0D;\nas I was running out.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe subsequently got in his car and drove to the field southwest of his property. He observed the helicopter was \"upside down\" in the bean field. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot by the Piatt County Coroner's Office. The autopsy listed blunt force trauma as the cause of death.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute prepared a Final Forensic Toxicology Accident Report. The report indicated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n0.161 (ug/ml, ug/g) Diphenhydramine detected in Blood (Heart)&#x0D;\nDiphenhydramine detected in Urine&#x0D;\nIbuprofen detected in Urine&#x0D;\nNaproxen detected in Urine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Toxicology's WebDrugs website description of Diphenhydramine indicated it is a common over the counter antihistamine used in the treatment of the common cold and hay fever. Additionally, Diphenhydramine is used as a sleep aid. It is available over the counter in products such as Benadryl and Unisom. Diphenhydramine carries the following FDA warning: may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Toxicology's WebDrugs website description of Ibuprofen indicated it is a nonnarcotic analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. This is available in prescription, as well as nonprescription forms like Motrin.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Toxicology's WebDrugs website description of Naproxen indicated it is a nonnarcotic analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. This is available in prescription, as well as nonprescription forms like Alleve. - At 1053, the recorded weather at the University of Illinois-Willard Airport, near Champaign/Urbana, Illinois, was: Wind 320 degrees at 16 knots gusting to 21 knots; visibility 10 statute miles; sky condition few clouds at 2,000 feet, scattered clouds at 2,800 feet, broken clouds at 3,500 feet; temperature 21 degrees C; dew point 15 degrees C; altimeter 29.91 inches of mercury. - The 47-year-old pilot held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commercial pilot certificate with airplane single engine land, rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument helicopter ratings. The pilot held an FAA second-class medical certificate, which was dated January 24, 2014. On the application for that medical certificate, he reported that he had accumulated 4,500 hours of total flight time and 100 hours in the six months prior to that medical examination. The pilot's medical application was deferred by the aviation medical examiner and was later found eligible for the medical certificate with no limitations. - The accident GPS was shipped to the National Transportation Safety Board Recorder Laboratory. A vehicle recorder specialist downloaded and decoded the GPS's track log data. A portion of the data extracted from the GPS included tracklog data recorded on August 12, 2014, which showed that the GPS began logging data points near the northeast corner of a farmer's field just south of E. 3300 North Rd at approximately 1000. The data showed the helicopter flew over and in the vicinity of the farmer's field for about the next 42 minutes. The data showed that the helicopter started flying in a westerly heading at around 1041:48. At that time, the data revealed the helicopter was flying at a speed of 28.9 mph and was at a GPS altitude of 827 feet MSL. The helicopter continued on a westerly heading and flew as low as 810 feet MSL. The ending portion of the data showed the helicopter had a trend of increasing altitude. The helicopter came to rest about 2,500 feet and about 235 degrees from the last recorded track log data point. The specialist's report is appended to the docket associated with this investigation. - The helicopter came to rest about 1,850 feet and about 310 degrees from the intersection of County Highway 2 and County Road 3200 North. An FAA inspector examined and documented the wreckage on-scene and removed the helicopter's GPS unit. Separated powerlines were observed near the accident site. A witness mark was melted into the leading edge of a main rotor blade. One of the powerlines was stretched and the top of its powerline pole was broken. The inspector reported that the helicopter impacted the ground approximately 250 feet southwest of the separated powerlines and it came to rest on a southeast heading in a bean field. The elevation of the terrain in the area was about 805 feet above mean sea level (MSL). The inspector subsequently shipped the GPS unit to the National Transportation Safety Board Recorder Laboratory. -",

A witness reported observing the helicopter flying about 200 ft above ground level and then descending to just above the sugarcane tops. The helicopter then pitched down and impacted terrain, and it was destroyed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 3 days before the accident, the helicopter received a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ramp check, during which numerous discrepancies with the helicopter were found including, in part, a cracked tailboom tube structure, rusted bolts with improper grip lengths, a disabled transmission chip light, a worn transmission gear with a backed-off locknut, and a lack of proper lubrication. The FAA inspector noted that the helicopter was in a poor condition and considered to be unairworthy. The pilot/owner, who was also a licensed mechanic, performed his own maintenance. It is unlikely that the pilot corrected the maintenance issues in the intervening 3 days; therefore, the airplane was likely unairworthy at the time of the accident. The accident is consistent with the loss of helicopter control for reasons that could not be determined because the helicopter was destroyed at impact.",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was drying cherry trees, which called for low-level flying in the helicopter. The landing area was slightly uphill with the ground tilted slightly to the right. Although the pilot had taken off and landed in that location at least once earlier in the day, wreckage documentation and ground scars revealed that, during the accident landing, the helicopter landed hard enough and with sufficient lateral motion to cause a dynamic rollover. No witnesses visually observed the accident; however, one witness heard the helicopter, followed by a thud and then silence. This witness responded to the accident and observed the helicopter on its side and smoking. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n Results of toxicology testing for the pilot detected therapeutic levels of tramadol, which is not known to undergo significant postmortem redistribution. Therefore, the identified levels likely represented his antemortem level of tramadol. Although with regular use people can develop a tolerance to the impairing effects of opioids, in this case, the pilot was engaging in a high workload and high risk portion of flight, and even a small level of impairment could have contributed to his inability to safely land the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration recommends that pilots using sedating medications on an occasional basis wait five maximum dosing intervals before flight. For tramadol that computes to waiting 40 hours (8 hours x 5) before flying; this pilot's therapeutic level suggests that he did not follow this recommendation. The pilot's impairment by tramadol likely contributed to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter was a Bell 206A, serial number 87. The operator reported that the helicopter had a total airframe time of 9,607 hours at the most recent annual inspection on April 22, 2014.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was a Rolls-Royce Allison, serial number CAE800363B. Total time recorded on the engine at the most recent annual inspection was 3,919 hours, and time since major overhaul was 538 hours. - On July 23, 2014, about 1418 Pacific daylight time, a Bell 206A, N949FM, landed hard and rolled onto its right side near Wenatchee, Washington. Applebee Aviation was operating the helicopter under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 for the cherry tree drying operation.  The commercial pilot sustained fatal injuries. The helicopter sustained substantial damage during the accident sequence. The local flight departed at an undetermined time. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo witnesses visually observed the accident. An ear witness heard the helicopter, and then a thud followed by silence. This witness and her spouse responded to the site, and observed the helicopter on its side and smoking. Other personnel arrived; they applied several fire extinguishers to the smoking area at the back of the engine, and the smoking stopped. - A postmortem examination was conducted by the Chelan County Coroner's Office. The cause of death was reported as the effect of blunt force injuries to the head.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological tests on specimens recovered from the pilot were performed by the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) Forensic Toxicology Research Team, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Their analysis revealed no findings for carbon monoxide or volatiles. They did not perform tests for cyanide.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe report contained the following findings for tested drugs: 0.028 (ug/ml, ug/g) O-Desmethyltramadol detected in blood, O-Desmethyltramadol detected in urine, 1.117 (ug/ml, ug/g) Tramadol detected in urine, and 0.139 (ug/ml, ug/g) Tramadol detected in blood.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn NTSB medical officer reviewed the autopsy and toxicology findings, and prepared a factual report, which is part of the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTramadol is an opioid analgesic Schedule IV controlled substance available by prescription, often marketed with the name Ultram. Therapeutic levels are considered between 0.05 ug/ml and 0.50 ug/ml. Tramadol carries the following warning: may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). Tramadol is also associated with an increase in the risk of seizures, particularly soon after initiation of treatment, doses are increased, or when high doses are used. The seizure warning reads, \"Seizures have been reported in patients receiving Tramadol hydrochloride within the recommended dosage range. Spontaneous post-marketing reports indicate that seizure risk is increased with doses of Tramadol hydrochloride above the recommended range. - An aviation routine weather report (METAR) for Wenatchee (KEAT), elevation 1,249 feet, 16 nautical miles (nm) southeast of the accident site, was issued at 1355 PDT. It stated: wind from 320 degrees at 11 knots; visibility 10 miles; sky 4,900 feet broken, 6,500 feet overcast; temperature 22/72 degrees C/F; dew point 14/57 degrees C/F; altimeter 39.91 inches of mercury. - The operator reported that the 40-year-old pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a rating for rotorcraft-helicopter.  The pilot held a second-class medical certificate issued on June 30, 2014, with no limitations or waivers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of the pilot's logbook indicated an estimated total flight time of 237 hours as of the last entry on July 15, 2014. He logged 12 hours in the previous 30 days, and had an estimated 13.2 hours in this make and model. The pilot's first logged entry was July 13, 2004. The logbook indicated 121.7 hours in an R22, and 76.8 hours in a Hughes 269A. He completed a flight check for the commercial pilot certificate on June 23, 2014. - Investigators examined the wreckage at a facility provided by the operator on July 30, 2014. Detailed examination notes are in the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe and engine were examined with no mechanical anomalies identified. - The National Transportation Safety Board investigator-in-charge (IIC) and a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector examined the wreckage on site. Detailed examination notes are in the public docket for this accident, and accessible via a link on the ntsb.gov home page.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was on its right side; the landing zone (LZ) was a grassy area that sloped in two directions. As the helicopter would approach to land from the left, there was a gradual downhill slope that was left to right and tail to nose.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe back section of the skids was more damaged than the front. The back right cross member separated at the connection of the skid; the back left cross member partially separated at the connection with the skid. There was a ground scar about 1-foot prior to the right skid in the direction of flight that was several feet long and parallel to the right skid.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left horizontal stabilator was touching the ground, exhibited crush damage, and was bent down; there was a ground scar about 15 inches long leading to it. The right horizontal stabilator was pointing up, and was not damaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe vertical stabilators were in a horizontal position. The bottom of the vertical stabilator and stinger were not damaged. The top of the vertical stabilator was damaged, and bent about 50 degrees to the left.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll servos were damaged with multiple jagged and angular separations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecovery personnel obtained about 25 gallons of clean clear fluid from the fuel tank that smelled like jet fuel. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "After the commercial pilot received an emergency medical services helicopter flight request, he quickly (in about 20 seconds) assessed the weather conditions and accepted the flight. No records were found indicating that the pilot obtained an official weather briefing before departing on the flight, and the investigation could not determine which weather resources the pilot used to assess the weather. About 8 minutes later, the pilot called the company's operations center to report that the flight was departing; this was the last communication received from the pilot. The helicopter was operating in an area that was known by company pilots, including the accident pilot, to have the potential for low visibility, even though there were no airport weather reporting facilities or Doppler radar coverage in the area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of GPS data showed that, while en route to pick up the patient, the helicopter performed a slight descending 360° turn before continuing toward the hospital. Weather overlays with the GPS track indicated that the helicopter made the 360° turn about the same time that an outflow boundary wave, which could have increased the potential for windshear and strong updrafts and downdrafts and reduced ceilings and visibility. Following the 360° turn, the helicopter proceeded toward the destination. About 14 minutes later, the helicopter turned right and began flying toward a major highway. It is likely that, due to the reduced visibility in the area, the pilot was flying toward the highway to follow the lights toward the city. The helicopter then turned further right and began to climb. As the helicopter entered another outflow boundary wave, it turned left. The left turn tightened, and the helicopter began to rapidly descend into terrain. The helicopter impacted a mesa in a near-level attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of a company communication recording showed that, about 17 minutes after the estimated accident time, the operations center attempted to contact the flight crew and was unsuccessful. The company sent three company helicopters to the accident helicopter's last known position; one helicopter pilot flew near the helicopter's site but was unable to see anything, and the two other pilots could not proceed close to the accident site due to clouds and low visibility. The wreckage was subsequently located by local law enforcement. A postaccident examination of the helicopter and engine did not reveal any anomalies that would have prevented normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to mid- and low-level cloud cover, it is likely that no lunar or celestial lighting was available for amplification by the pilot's night vision goggles (NVG). Since the helicopter was not equipped with an infrared spotlight, only cultural light would have been available for NVG amplification. However, the helicopter was operating in a remote, sparsely populated area with minimal cultural light. Although the pilot's recurrent training included recovery procedures from inadvertent entry into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), and his training records showed that he satisfactorily completed this item on his most recent training flight about 8 months before the accident, the circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot's inadvertent visual flight into IMC, which resulted in a loss of helicopter control.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "Low Visibility Area&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was operating in an area that was known by company pilots to have the potential for low visibility. This area extended from Moriarty, New Mexico, to Amarillo, Texas, and from Wagon Mound, New Mexico, to Fort Sumner, New Mexico. TSCF personnel reported that this area could develop low visibility even when the surrounding aviation weather stations reported clear weather. A photo of the map at the Santa Fe base is provided in the docket associated with this report.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nITT Night Vision &amp; Imaging Aviator Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) 9 F4949&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator utilized a Generation III ANVIS 9 system for their aircrews. According to company personnel, the pilot and one additional crew member were to utilize the ANVIS 9 during NVG operations. Marketing documents stated that the ANVIS 9 had a 40 degree nominal field of view. The F4949 intensified light 2,000 to 3,500 times.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMeteorological modelling of the accident area estimated that due to mid and low-level cloud cover, the helicopter likely operated without the aid of lunar or celestial light sources. The helicopter was not equipped with infrared spotlight, nor was it required to be. The helicopter was equipped with a regular spotlight which would not have been compatible with the NVGs and was likely not used.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot and one of the crew members would have utilized the NVGs during the flight. Damage to the NVGs precluded the determination of whether the NVGs were in the down position during the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUnited States Army Field Manual (FM) 3-04.203, Fundamentals of Flight, May 2007&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Army has incorporated NVGs into their flying programs for decades, making their knowledge base larger than most organizations. While not required reading for civilian pilots, FM 3-04.203 was constructed to educate pilots of the principles surrounding aviation for them to be better prepared to react to unexpected conditions. Chapter three titled \"Rotor-Wing Environmental Flight,\" section 62 states \"…when moon illumination is low or during the new-moon cycle, the desert presents a formidable challenge to night flying. It is probably the most difficult environment in which to interpret terrain relief and elevation, especially while using [night vision devices]. Unaided night flight and operations are far more difficult and not recommended.\" In chapter four, titled \"Rotary-Wing Night Flight,\" several passages described the hazards and risks of night flight with night vision systems. Key points were that the NVGs had a tendency to distort depth perception and distance estimation with the quality of depth perception being dependent on ambient light, terrain surface conditions, the ability of the NVG device, and the pilot's experience flying in those conditions. \"…adverse weather is difficult to detect at night. Often the decrease in visual acuity and a gradual loss of horizon are very subtle. As meteorological conditions deteriorate, aviators must decrease airspeed to reduce risk of flying into inadvertent [instrument meteorological conditions].\" The \"NVG's field of view significantly reduces peripheral vision as compared with unaided flight. Crewmembers must use a continual scanning pattern to compensate for the loss.\" \"Maneuvers requiring large bank angles or rapid attitude changes tend to induce spatial disorientation. An aviator should avoid making drastic changes in attitude/bank angles and use proper scanning and viewing techniques.\" - The Agusta A109E helicopter was manufactured in 2000 and had been modified for helicopter air ambulance (HAA) flight operations. It was powered by twin Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PW206C turbo shaft engines each rated at 549 horsepower. The helicopter was certified for instrument flight rules operations. The last inspection, completed on July 4, 2014, was an approved aircraft inspection program which combined the 25 hour, 50 hour, and 150 hour inspections. After that date, the helicopter flew 17.3 hours with 2 discrepancies. On July 7, the accident pilot reported weak wheel brakes which were replaced that day. On July 11, the accident pilot reported a transmission oil chip light illumination. After the flight, maintenance cleaned \"slight fuzz\" from the chip detectors and returned the helicopter to service.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a Garmin GNS-530 GPS/NAV/COM, a SkyConnect Transceiver, and a panel mounted Garmin GPSmap 396. The cockpit was modified for NVG use via a supplemental type certificate. In addition, the helicopter was equipped with an enhanced ground proximity warning system, auto flight system, and radar altimeter. - TSCF used the SkyConnect satellite communication system to communicate between their California based operations center and the accident helicopter. At 0050:48, the pilot called the operations center to report that he had departed for Tucumcari. No further communications were made from the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was operating under a company visual flight rules flight plan and was not in communication with air traffic control. - On July 17, 2014, at 0142 mountain daylight time, an Agusta A109E helicopter, N507CF, collided with a mesa near Newkirk, New Mexico. The commercial pilot, flight nurse, and paramedic were fatally injured. A postimpact fire ensued and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to and operated by TriState CareFlight LLC under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a positioning flight. Night visual meteorological conditions existed for the helicopter's departure and a company visual flight rules flight plan was filed. The flight originated from the Santa Fe Municipal Airport (SAF), Santa Fe, New Mexico, at 0051 and was en route to a hospital in Tucumcari, New Mexico.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was the subject of an alert notice and was found by a local resident. The helicopter wreckage came to rest on the north side of a mesa about 150 ft above the surrounding terrain. A postimpact fire consumed a majority of the fuselage. All main airframe and engine components were accounted for at the accident site. - An autopsy was authorized and conducted on the pilot by the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator. The cause of death was the result of multiple injuries and the manner of death was ruled an accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForensic toxicology was performed on specimens from the pilot by the FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Testing was negative for all tested drugs and substances. - A weather study was conducted for the accident flight by an NTSB Senior Meteorologist. A review of the National Weather Service Surface Analysis Chart for 0000 mountain daylight time (MDT) found a fairly active surface environment with a surface trough located over the accident site at 0000 MDT. In addition, a stationary front was located south of the accident site and three areas of low pressure were located to the distant northwest, south, and southeast of the accident site. Potential existed for clouds and precipitation due to numerous lifting mechanisms around the accident site to include combined surface, low-level, and mid-level troughs. At 1845 on July 16, the Storm Prediction Center predicted a 15% chance of damaging thunderstorm wind or gusts of 50 knots within the vicinity of the accident site until 0600 on July 17.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of aviation weather reporting facilities in the vicinity of the accident flight, revealed that the helicopter likely had a southerly wind component until flying south to southeast of Las Vegas, New Mexico at which point the wind would have shifted to out of the northeast. In addition, cloud ceiling would have lowered as the flight proceeded towards Tucumcari. An upper air sounding indicated the potential for cloud formations between 5,000 and 8,000 ft mean sea level (msl), with the possibility of rain showers and thunderstorms. Additionally, the sounding indicated the strongest wind speeds possible with a microburst or outflow boundary would have been between 45 to 53 mph. A potential for low-level wind shear was identified between 5,000 and 6,000 ft msl with clear air turbulence from the surface to 10,000 ft msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest Doppler radar site was located at Cannon Air Force Base (FDX), located 43 miles southeast of the accident site. Scans initiated between 2124 MDT on July 16 through 0235 MDT on July 17, revealed two distinct features before, during, and after the accident time. First, an outflow boundary moved from east to west across New Mexico from 2124 MDT to 0030 MDT. As the outflow boundary moved from east to west, the surface wind direction switched from southerly to northeasterly, concurrent with the aviation weather reporting facilities. Next, another outflow boundary and wave pattern was detected on the 0235 scan but due to Doppler beam angle and distance to the accident site was likely masked on the earlier scan. Backwards trajectory analysis was completed to map the progression of the outflow boundaries. Mapping estimated that the first outflow boundary and associated convective activity would have been over the accident site at the accident time. This would have increased the potential for increased wind shear, strong updrafts and downdrafts, reduced ceilings, and reduced visibility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) Sierra, issued at 2045 MDT on July 16 and valid at the accident time for the accident site and route of flight, forecasted instrument meteorological conditions for the accident site with ceilings below 1,000 ft and visibility below 3 miles with precipitation and mist.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe terminal aerodrome forecast (TAF) for Tucumcari, located 32 miles east of the accident site, issued at 2334 MDT on July 16 forecasted wind from 030 degrees at 11 knots, prevailing visibility 6 miles, rain showers in the vicinity, few clouds at 2,000 ft agl and a broken ceiling at 8,000 ft agl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe phase of the Moon was waning gibbous with 65% of the Moon's visible disk illuminated. At the time of the accident there would have been no moon visible due to the mid- and low-level cloud cover that the accident flight was likely flying beneath. - TriState CareFlight LLC Operations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was operated by TriState CareFlight LLC. The helicopter was tasked in accordance with the company's standard operating procedure. Telephone recordings were provided which revealed information about the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0018, a hospital in Tucumcari, New Mexico, telephoned TSCF's operations center to request a patient transfer from the hospital to another hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The helicopter stationed at Tucumcari had been recently tasked with another flight, so the operations center contacted the pilot of the closest helicopter which had landed in Amarillo, Texas to refuel. The pilot declined the flight due to thunderstorms between Amarillo and Tucumcari. At 0042, TSCF's operation center contacted the accident pilot at Santa Fe, New Mexico and provided the flight request details. After being given the route of flight, the pilot assessed the weather for about 20 seconds before accepting the flight. It is unclear what weather resources the pilot may have consulted prior to the accident flight. At 0050, the pilot called the operations center and informed them that he was departing for the flight. That was the last transmission made from the accident crew.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the helicopter stopped tracking, the operations center received a notification that the helicopter's progress had stopped. At 0200, the operations center attempted to contact the accident crew via satellite communications and cellphones and was unsuccessful. At 0209, the operations center contacted the on-call supervisor and informed him that a helicopter was dispatched to Tucumcari and was overdue. At 0215, a teleconference was held with multiple supervisors from the company attempting to locate and contact the accident crew. They contacted local law enforcement and asked for officers to respond to the last known location. At 0234, TSCF called the local flight service station and asked to begin search and rescue procedures for the helicopter and its crew. TSCF tasked several company helicopters to fly to the last known coordinates of the accident helicopter to see if they could locate the helicopter or contact the crew on the radios. Three helicopters flew towards the accident site and two of the helicopters were unable to proceed due to low visibility. One helicopter flew near the helicopter's site but was unable to see anything, could not reach the crew on the radio, and did not hear an emergency locator transmitter beacon. At 0322, TSCF was informed that the local land owner's ranch hand spotted a fire on the property near the last coordinates and responded to investigate. At 0355, New Mexico State Police confirmed that the wreckage of a helicopter had been located.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOperations Specifications&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn reference to the accident flight, the following specifications would have been valid for the flight:&#x0D;\nThe Agusta 109 helicopters were authorized to perform visual flight rules (VFR) flight en route and could operate both day and night. Flights at night in designated mountainous terrain must have a minimum ceiling of 1,000 ft. Night \"local\" flights needed 3 miles visibility and \"cross country\" flights needed 5 miles visibility. Local flying areas are those areas in which the pilot has demonstrated a level of familiarity which allows the use of lower VFR operating minima. Prior to conducting VFR operations, the pilot must determine the minimum safe altitudes along the planned en route phase of flight to include the minimum safe cruise altitude. The pilot must clear all terrain and obstacles for the route of flight by at least 500 ft for night operations. All night or NVG en route cruise operations require a minimum altitude of 500 ft agl. Prior to each flight, the pilot assesses the risk for the flight through the completion of a risk assessment form. Only the risk assessment form for the previous flight was located. The form for the accident flight was likely onboard the helicopter and was destroyed in the accident. - The pilot, age 46, held a commercial pilot certificate for helicopter and instrument helicopter. He also held a flight instructor certificate for helicopter and instrument helicopter. On September 17, 2013, the pilot was issued a second class medical certificate with the limitation that he must wear corrective lenses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was hired by TriState CareFlight (TSCF) on September 10, 2009. During his employment with TSFC, he began flying Agusta 119 helicopters, before being transferred to Eurocopter AS350 helicopters. On December 13, 2012, he was assigned the duties of pilot in command of Agusta A109 helicopters. Using data from TSCF and the pilot's annual resume, it was estimated that he accumulated about 6,167 total hours, with 208 hours in Agusta A109 helicopters, over 410 hours of night time, 75 hours of simulated instrument conditions, and 0 hours of actual instrument conditions. The pilot had been operating out the of the Santa Fe base for over a year and a half and had been flying in the mountainous desert environment of Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico since his hire in 2009. He had flown numerous flights in the Santa Fe and Tucumcari areas prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe most recent check flight for the pilot was accomplished on December 16, 2013. It was a combined 14 CFR Part 135.293 and 135.299 check flight. The flight lasted 1.2 hours, was flown completely under night vision goggle (NVG) use, and some of the maneuvers flown and evaluated included: normal operations, emergency operations, unusual attitude recovery, inadvertent instrument flight rules (IFR) procedures, and NVG failure in flight. Astrological conditions for that training flight would have included clear skies with a bright moon at 100% disk illumination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was qualified to fly using NVGs. At the time of the accident he had accrued at least 162 hours of flight assisted by NVGs. His last recurrent NVG training flight was on December 16, 2013, with ground training accomplished that day. The pilot inspected and tested his NVGs on July 16 and reported no discrepancies on the company's NVG Sign-Off Sheet. In the 90 days prior to the accident, he had flown 8.3 hours of NVG time:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDate Hours&#x0D;\nApril 23, 2014 0.4&#x0D;\nApril 25 2.4&#x0D;\nApril 27 1&#x0D;\nMay 22 2.6&#x0D;\nMay 26 1&#x0D;\nMay 27 0.2&#x0D;\nJune 18 1.1&#x0D;\nJune 19 0.6&#x0D;\nJuly 16 0.8&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot normally worked a schedule that consisted of 7 days on-call and 7 days off-call. Prior to the accident, the pilot had been on-call for 15 days. From July 2 to July 8, the pilot was on-call between 0700 until 1900. The pilot was then given 24 hours off and then on July 9, was on-call between 1900 until 0700. The accident occurred on the pilot's eighth consecutive shift. Prior to the accident flight he had previously flown 0.6 hours on that same shift. - SkyConnect Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe onboard SkyConnect system allowed for tracking of the company's helicopters at their operations center. The data track began at 0052 with the helicopter on the company's helipad at SAF. The helicopter briefly taxied southwest on taxiway Charlie before it departed the airport. While en route, the system reported the helicopter's position about every 30 seconds. The helicopter tracked on a 100° heading at 9,500 ft msl (about 3,800 ft agl) and 160 knots groundspeed until about 25 miles southeast of Las Vegas, New Mexico. At 0120:13 the Garmin GPSmap 396's data began recording and provided better data resolution than the SkyConnect data. The two tracks followed very closely to each other with the Garmin data being captured about every 10-20 seconds. This report will focus primarily on the data provided by the Garmin.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGarmin GPSmap 396&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe data from the panel mounted GPS was downloaded and found to retain the accident flight. Flight data began recording at 0120:13 when the helicopter was already en route to Tucumcari. The first complete data point from the accident flight occurred at 0120:26 as the helicopter tracked 106° at 9,237 ft msl with a groundspeed of 158 knots. At 0121, the helicopter began a slight descending left 360° turn. The helicopter descended as low as 1,225 ft agl before it resumed a course towards Tucumcari. The helicopter flew about 6,600 ft msl (about 1,200-1,800 ft agl) with a groundspeed of about 130 knots. At 0136:17, about 30 miles west from Tucumcari, the helicopter turned right and flew south-southeast. The helicopter descended to 6,000 ft msl and the groundspeed increased to 160 knots and then reduced to 140 knots. At 0140:09 the helicopter continued the right turn and flew south-southwest while climbing to 7,763 ft msl. At 0140:49, the helicopter turned left. As the helicopter passed through a 90 degree heading change, the helicopter began to descend. At 0141:21 the helicopter began a 940 ft per minute (fpm) descent, which increased until the last reporting point. The helicopter continued a left 360° turn that tightened as the turn progressed. The last reporting point occurred at 0141:47 with the helicopter at 4,840 ft msl (200 ft agl) and groundspeed of 93 knots. The estimated final descent rate was 14,760 fpm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather overlays with GPS flight track&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to weather radar beam angles and distance to the accident site from the weather radar sites, the radar beam likely missed the outflow boundary around the accident time. Using known weather information, modelling of the outflow boundary waves was performed. Weather associated with these outflow boundary waves would be consistent with increased wind shear, strong updrafts and downdrafts, reduced ceilings, and reduced visibility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the helicopter flew east-southeast and performed a slight descending 360° turn at 0121, it was directly near the estimated location of an outflow boundary wave. The boundary wave was the second wave that moved through the area from the north-northwest to the south-southeast. The helicopter accelerated past the second boundary wave and continued to the east-southeast. At 0136, when the helicopter maneuvered to the south-southeast it was between the first and second boundary wave. At 0141, the helicopter likely flew into the first boundary wave about the time it began the left turn and descent toward the terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAgusta Engineering Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngineers from Augusta Helicopters assessed the Garmin GPS data to evaluate the ability of a helicopter to perform the final spiraling left 360° turn. They found that the helicopter remained within the structural design limits and estimated the helicopter bank angles continued to increase during the turn almost reaching 70° of bank and loaded near 2.7 Gs. The helicopter would have been flying a high speed, high load factor descending turn, with its main rotor system approaching or having reached its aerodynamic limit. - The helicopter came to rest midway between the peak and the surrounding terrain of a 300-foot high mesa, at a measured elevation of 4,654 ft msl. The wreckage was generally located in one area with fragments of main rotor blades and light debris scattered nearby. A postimpact fire consumed a majority of the wreckage. The main wreckage consisted of the main rotors, fuselage, tail boom, and tail rotors. Some of the exterior panels and medical equipment were found strewn in the area surrounding the wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll linkages between the swash plate and pitch change horns were found intact and cotter pinned. The tail rotor blades rotated when the tail rotor drive shaft was turned by hand. All linkages to the tail rotor blades were found intact and cotter pinned. On the boulder where the tail rotor had come to rest, machining was visible on the rock's surface consistent with tail rotor blade strikes. In addition, the top of a boulder closest to the nose of the helicopter wreckage displayed circular scuffing with a portion of a main rotor blade tip wedged into the rock.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's airspeed indicator needle pointed at 190 knots. Of note, the helicopter's never exceed speed (Vne) is listed as 168 knots. The left side vertical speed indicator needle pointed between 2,500 and 3,000 ft per minute descent. All other gauges were destroyed or unreadable. The lower portion of the helicopter was partially buried in the dirt and gear positioning was consistent with the landing gear in the retracted position. The emergency locator beacon was impact and thermally damaged. A Garmin GPSmap 396 was found buried in the dirt and was sent to the NTSB laboratories in Washington, D.C. for a data download.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to the mesa's slope and thermal damaging of the surrounding rocks, the wreckage could not be fully examined on-site. A postaccident examination was conducted after the wreckage was transported to a storage facility. The examination revealed that portions of the flight controls displayed fracture signatures consistent with overload and/or thermal damage. No preimpact anomalies were detected with the flight controls. The engines were examined and did not display any preimpact anomalies. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial-rated pilot and passenger were en route to an oil platform located in the Gulf of Mexico. A witness, who was on the platform, saw the helicopter heading toward the platform. As the helicopter approached, it started to spin in a clockwise direction. The helicopter spun several times before it dropped to the water. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  Examination of the helicopter and rotor system did not reveal any preimpact abnormalities. Weather stations located about 26 and 48 miles from the accident site reported favorable conditions with relatively light wind. Given the lack of specific wind information for the accident location and the lack of information regarding the helicopter's direction, speed, and altitude as it approached the platform, it could not be determined if the helicopter experienced a loss of tail rotor effectiveness. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  A medical review of the pilot noted discrepancies between his declared medical conditions and medicine usage and those found during the autopsy and toxicology tests. However, there was not enough information to determine whether a medical issue resulted in the pilot's loss of helicopter control.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn June 11, 2014, about 1430 central daylight time, a Bell 206 L4 helicopter, N207MY, impacted the waters in the Gulf of Mexico. The helicopter was registered to Coy Leasing, LLC, and operated by Westwind Helicopters, Inc., under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 as an on-demand air taxi. The commercial rated pilot and passenger were fatally injured and the helicopter was destroyed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and company flight following was in effect at the time of the accident.  The flight departed Ship Shoal 266B oil platform at 1409, and was en route to the South Timbalier 317 (ST 317) platform.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was located on the ST 317 oil platform reported that he heard the helicopter approach the platform.  The helicopter was on a straight in approach to the platform, when the helicopter started to spin in a clockwise direction.  The witness added they he heard a \"snap\" like something broke, and it looked like the baggage compartment door was open and debris was coming out of the baggage compartment during the spin. The helicopter spun 8-10 times, before the helicopter went silent and dropped to the water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter sank and was recovered from about a depth of 380 feet of water. The tail boom had separated from the main fuselage and was recovered from the surface of the water.  One of the main rotor blades, which had separated about four feet from the mast, was not recovered.  Several sections of the helicopter were not recovered which included the landing skids, cabin door, and floor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a U.S. commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. The pilot held a second class medical certificate issued on November 13, 2013, with the restriction; \"must wear corrective lenses\".  At the time of the exam, the pilot reported 13,500 hours total flight time with 260 hours in last six months. In addition, he held a Canadian private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single land, multi-engine land and helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Bell 206 L4, is a two –bladed, single-engine, helicopter. The helicopter was powered by a Rolls-Royce (Allison) 250-C30P turbo shaft engine.  The helicopter's last 100 hour inspection was on May 18, 2014, at an aircraft total time of 6,387 hrs. The engine had 19,736 hours total hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of maintenance records for the helicopter revealed a maintenance discrepancy was written as \"no fwd cyclic\", four days before the accident.  The pilot who entered the write-up reported that he no forward and limited left cyclic.  He also stated that the control felt more like a jam, rather than a hydraulic problem and that he didn't push too hard. Maintenance annotated in the records that the helicopter controls were checked and then flight checked, with no defects noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1450, the automated weather observation facility located at the Houma-Terrebonne Airport&#x0D;\nHouma, Louisiana, about 92 miles north of the accident site recorded; wind from 360 degrees at 4 knots, 6 miles visibility in haze, scattered clouds 5,000 feet, temperature 93 degrees Fahrenheit (F), dew point 70 F, and a barometric pressure of 29.91 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest surrounding weather reporting locations were identified as oil platforms; Green Canyon 338 (KGRY), Mississippi Canyon (KMDJ), Ship Shoal 178 (KLSPR), and Green Canyon 78 (KATP).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1420, the automated  weather observation facility located at KGRY, located about 26 miles south-southwest recorded: wind variable at 5 knots with gusts to 13 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, sky clear below 12,000 feet, temperature 30° Celsius (C), dew point 24° C, and an altimeter 29.92 inches of mercury (Hg).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1435, the automated  weather observation facility located at KMDJ, located about 48 miles south-southwest recorded: wind 280 degrees at 7 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, sky clear below 12,000 feet, temperature 29° C, dew point 22° C, and an altimeter 29.93 inches of mercury (Hg).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no convective SIGMETs for the accident area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF) to the accident site was issued for Houma-Terrebonne Airport (KHUM), Houma, Louisiana.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forecast indicated a west-southwest wind at 7 knots, visibility unrestricted, and few clouds at 5,000 feet agl.  No significant weather was expected surrounding the period.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) Winds and Temperature Aloft Forecast (FD) valid during the accident time for New Orleans expected at 3,000 feet msl a wind from 250° at 11 knots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Air Resource Laboratory (ARL) archive data of North American Mesoscale (NAM) numerical model data was obtained and a sounding plotted on a standard Skew-T log P diagram from the surface to 18,000 feet over the approximate accident site at 1300 CDT utilizing RAOB software.  The sounding depicted a surface temperature of 28° C (82° F), with a dew point temperature of 23° C (74° F), and a relative humidity of 75%, with a density altitude of 1,835 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe model surface wind was from 240° at 7 knots, with a slight veering clockwise with the wind with height to the west.  The model wind at 400 and 1,000 feet was from approximately 240° at 8 knots, and did not indicate any low-level wind shears.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA complete Weather Study Report was prepared for this investigation; the Group Chairman's factual report is located in the docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCOMMUNICATIONS and RADAR INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a Sky Connect system.  The system recorded the helicopter had flown 6 hours 26 minutes on June 11.  The flight system recorded the helicopter's departure and flight en route to ST 317.  Several positon points were recorded during the flight which indicated the helicopter was on a east-southeast heading.  The helicopter's altitude and airspeed varied, but the altitude was generally above 550 feet agl, with an airspeed of about 115 knots.  The last recorded position of the helicopter was at 1923:49 (greenwich mean time) on a heading of 121 degrees, at an altitude of 551 feet, and an airspeed of 111 knots; approximately 0.9 miles from ST 317.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRPORT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSouth Timbalier 317 is an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, located about 67 miles off the coast of Louisiana, and about 100 miles south of Houma, Louisiana.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was transported to the operator's facility located near Santa Fe, Texas. Examination of the wreckage was conducted by the NTSB, FAA, and technical representatives from the engine and airframe manufacturers.  The helicopter was heavily damaged during the accident with extensive damage to the cabin. The engine and transmission remained attached to the fuselage. The cabin and cockpit of the helicopter was destroyed; the cabin floor was not with the fuselage, nor recovered with the wreckage.  One of the two main rotor blades remained attached to the mast and the other blade had separated about 4 feet from the mast. The tailboom separated just aft of the fuselage, the tail rotor drive shaft had rotational scoring near the hangar bearings; the tail rotor gearbox remained with the tailboom and both tail rotor blades remained attached, and bent, towards the tailboom. The flight control connections were secure; however, the condition of the fuselage and separation of the tailboom, prevented movement of the tail rotor controls. The effect of salt water immersion was beginning, however, continuity and rotation of the transmission was established.  Engine continuity to the accessory was established and the turbine and compressor sections were free to rotate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Jefferson Parish Forensic Center, Harvey, Louisiana conducted an autopsy on the pilot. The cause of death was determined to be, \"multiple blunt force injuries\".&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing on the pilot was not conducted by the FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, because the specimens were ruined during shipment.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the pilot's FAA medical records indicated that the pilot had not reported any chronic medical problems nor medications to the FAA.  However, his autopsy identified a large area of myocardial scarring and fibrosis as well as the presence of a patent stent in the left anterior descending coronary artery; the other coronary arteries were too damaged to be assessed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Jefferson Parish coroner did conducted toxicological testing.   The result was positive for 2,500 ng/mL of Tramadol.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTramadol is a prescription medication used to treat moderate to severe pain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEST AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's hydraulic system, section of the main rotor blade, tail boom, and two sections of the tail rotor drive shaft were sent to the Bell Field Investigations Laboratory, in Hurst, Texas. An examination of the components was conducted under the supervision of the NTSB, FAA, and technical representatives of HR Woodard, Bell Helicopter, and the operator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the fractures on the tail rotor drive section was consistent with overload as a result of extreme bending.  The tailboom section had buckling damage of the left side; the section was absent of paint transfer from any object impact. Additionally, the paint cracks on the tailboom were consistent with buckling of the tailboom metal.  The facture surface of the main rotor blade section was also inspected; the D channel spar was bent aft and downward and consistent with an overload failure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic system was removed from the helicopter's fuselage and examined at the lab.  The pump and hydraulic actuators were separated from the system and tested on a hydraulic test stand.  The hydraulic filters were partially restricted with fine particles. Despite impact damage to the pump and salt water immersion of the system, the hydraulic system functionally performed with no anomalies noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe three actuators were then sent to the manufacturer in Santa Clarita, California for additional examination. A disassembly examination was conducted under the supervision of the NTSB and a technical representative from Woodward HRT.  Examination of the actuators did not reveal any abnormalities, nor evidence of any previous malfunction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExcerpts from FAA Helicopter Handbook, FAA-H-8083-21A, Chapter 11 - Helicopter Emergencies and Hazards:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLoss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness (LTE) or an unanticipated yaw is defined as an uncommanded, rapid yaw towards the advancing blade which does not subside of its own accord. It can result in the loss of the aircraft if left unchecked. It is very important for pilots to understand that LTE is caused by an aerodynamic interaction between the main rotor and tail rotor and not caused from a mechanical failure. Some helicopter types are more likely to encounter LTE due to the normal certification thrust produced by having a tail rotor that, although meeting certification standards, is not always able to produce the additional thrust demanded by the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUnfortunately, the aerodynamic conditions that a helicopter is susceptible to are not explainable in black and white terms. LTE is no exception. There are a number of contributing factors but what is more important to understanding LTE are taking the contributing factors and couple them with situations that should be avoided. Whenever possible, pilots should learn to avoid the following combinations:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1. Low and slow flight outside of ground effect.&#x0D;\n2. Winds from ±15º of the 10 o'clock position and probably on around to 5 o'clock position&#x0D;\n3. Tailwinds that may alter the onset of translational lift and translational thrust hence induce high power demands and demand more anti-torque (left pedal) than the tail rotor can produce.&#x0D;\n4. Low speed downwind turns.&#x0D;\n5. Large changes of power at low airspeeds.&#x0D;\n6. Low speed flight in the proximity of physical obstructions that may alter a smooth airflow to both the main rotor and tail rotor. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "***This report was revised on November 29, 2017. Please see the docket for this accident to view the original report.***&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident flight was one of several recent practice external-load flights that the pilot had been conducting with a 150-ft long-line and weighted barrel. The helicopter approached the airport from the north and then hovered over the approach end of runway 20R. At the time, two airplanes were in the airport traffic pattern for runway 20R, another was in the airport vicinity, and a fourth was departing from runway 2R toward the hovering helicopter. One witness reported hearing the accident pilot attempt to communicate with the departing northbound airplane, but no response was heard, and the airplane passed close to the helicopter. After the northbound airplane passed by, the helicopter moved to its normal landing area on the east ramp, and the accident pilot responded to another pilot's query as to his intentions by stating that he was landing. Immediately after the pilot's response, the helicopter suddenly pitched up, rolled left, and descended to the ground.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical anomalies with the airframe, systems, or powerplant. Damage to the main rotor and associated ground scars and wreckage distribution were consistent with the rotor system operating at normal rpm during the impact sequence. Damage to the helicopter and the location of the main rotor ground scar were consistent with the helicopter having collided with the ground in an extreme left roll. The long-line remained attached to the barrel but was not attached to the helicopter's cargo hook, and the disconnected end was near the main wreckage. The relative orientation of the long-line and the main wreckage indicated that the line was still attached to the helicopter when the helicopter moved laterally at some point; however, no known witness observed when or how smoothly the line and load were released.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nManeuvering a helicopter to land during external load operations requires precision in both helicopter control and timing of load release. Although the accident pilot's workload was increased by the demands of maintaining traffic separation and communicating on the radio in the busy, nontowered airport environment, there was no evidence to suggest that such an operation was beyond his skill level, particularly given his recent practice. The accident pilot was based at BCV and, in the 2 weeks before the accident, had conducted seven flights (including the accident flight) with a 150-foot long-line in the accident helicopter; in the preceding 90 days, the pilot had flown almost 60 hours, most of which involved autorotations, hover maneuvers, and long-line practice.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's autopsy identified severe coronary artery disease with greater than 75% stenosis in two main arteries. In addition, scarring in the left ventricle was identified, which indicated that the pilot had experienced a previous heart attack. Although the pilot had sought and received in recent years medical care that included cardiac testing, there is no evidence that his previous heart attack was ever diagnosed (research has shown that the tests are not always accurate). Given the presence of two severely stenotic lesions in two main arteries and the presence of scarring from a previous heart attack, the accident pilot's likelihood for experiencing another acute cardiac event (such as a new heart attack, anginal symptoms, or an acute arrhythmia) was inevitable. An acute cardiac event would likely cause symptoms ranging in severity from impairing (such as chest pain and shortness of breath or palpitations) to incapacitating (fainting from low blood pressure or sudden cardiac death). Further, such an event occurring immediately before impact would likely leave no identifiable evidence on autopsy. Considering the precision required while maneuvering to land with an external load, any level of impairment could result in catastrophic consequences; therefore, the pilot likely experienced a sudden, acute cardiac event that adversely affected his performance.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter was equipped with a Lycoming IO-540-AE1A5 engine. According to inspection and maintenance records, the most recent engine log entry, dated March 14, 2014, documented a 50-hour inspection, oil and filter change, oil screen check, and Hobbs meter replacement; the engine time since overhaul was recorded as 120.2 hours. The most recent airframe log entry, dated May 12, 2014, documented the installation of new position lights and the adjustment of the left helipod brackets; the airframe total time was documented as 2,339.4 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe records indicated that the engine was overhauled to factory new limits on April 26, 2013, at an engine total time of 2,200 hours. A maintenance record dated June 18, 2013, recorded that the overhauled engine was installed at an airframe total time of 2166.8 hours; other maintenance recorded on that date included the overhaul of the Onboard Systems International cargo hook, model 528-023-01. - BCV, elevation 83 ft msl, was located 2 miles northwest of Chugiak, Alaska. BCV was a nontowered airport with a 4,010 ft x 100 ft asphalt runway (2L/20R) and an 1,800 ft x 50 ft  runway (2R/20L). The CTAF was 123.0 MHz. - On May 28, 2014, at 1433 Alaska daylight time, a Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter, N392GP, collided with the ground and caught fire while maneuvering for landing during an external-load flight at Birchwood Airport (BCV), Chugiak, Alaska. The commercial pilot was fatally injured, and the helicopter was destroyed by the ground impact and postimpact fire. The flight was operated by Global Positioning Services, Inc., under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 with no flight plan filed. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed. The local flight departed BCV about 1315.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator's representative, the pilot had been conducting practice flights with a 150-ft long-line attached to a fluid-filled, 55-gallon barrel in preparation for an upcoming project. Satellite flight-following data provided by the operator (the helicopter was equipped with a Latitude Technologies system that recorded data in 2-minute intervals) showed that the entire flight remained within 5 nautical miles (nm) of the airport, maneuvering near the airport and northeast along the coast of Knik Arm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses at the airport said that they saw the helicopter flying on the day of the accident with the barrel suspended beneath it by the long-line. One witness, who was a pilot flying his airplane near the airport with a passenger, said that he heard the accident pilot provide position reports over the airport common traffic advisory frequency (CTAF) about every half mile, beginning from about 5 miles out as the helicopter approached BCV from the north. When the helicopter arrived at the airport, the witness observed it hover over the approach end of runway 20R (the longer of the airport's two parallel runways). The witness recalled that, in addition to his airplane, one airplane was flying on the downwind leg of the traffic pattern for runway 20R, a second airplane was flying southbound east of the highway, and a third airplane was departing from runway 2R (the shorter parallel runway). The witness said that he heard the accident pilot communicate over the CTAF to the departing airplane several times, \"Did you hear me?\" but there was no response from the pilot of the departing airplane. Both the witness in the airplane and another on the ground said that the departing airplane appeared to pass close to the hovering helicopter as the airplane headed north and left the area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe witness in the airplane intended to land on runway 20R, so he maneuvered his airplane to wait for the helicopter to clear the runway. As the helicopter transitioned east toward the ramp where it normally landed, he asked the helicopter pilot over the CTAF his intentions. The witness reported that the helicopter pilot responded, \"landing,\" then there was a \"click\" over the radio, and the helicopter suddenly pitched nose-up, rolled over to the left, descended, and crashed. The passenger in the witness' airplane said that the helicopter pitched \"way nose up,\" rolled left, then descended near vertically to the ground. The passenger witness demonstrated the movement with his hand, illustrating that the helicopter's motion was sudden, and its left roll was extreme before it descended straight down to the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMultiple witnesses on the ground reported hearing \"pop\" or \"bang\" noises, and one reported \"two cracks and a loud boom.\" None of these witnesses had the helicopter in view when they heard the noises, and no known witnesses saw in detail the relative positions of the helicopter, its long-line, and the load during the accident sequence. One ground witness, who was in a hangar adjacent to the accident site, reported that the helicopter's engine made a high-pitch sound followed by two loud \"bang\" noises that came a few seconds apart. When he looked to see what made the sound, he saw the helicopter on the ground in flames with the smoke blowing toward the hangar. - The State of Alaska Medical Examiner's Office, Anchorage, Alaska, performed an autopsy on the pilot. The report listed the pilot's cause of death as \"multiple blunt force injuries\" and noted that the thermal injuries were sustained postmortem.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe autopsy report also noted focal areas of greater than 75% atherosclerotic stenosis in both the mid left anterior descending coronary artery and the distal right coronary artery; the other coronary arteries showed scattered calcific atherosclerosis without significant stenosis. Focal white scarring was identified in the posterior left ventricle consistent with a remote myocardial infarct (heart attack). Microscopic evaluation of the heart identified the area as \"confluent fibrosis consistent with remote infarct.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed forensic toxicology on specimens from the pilot. The report stated that no carbon monoxide was detected in the blood, no ethanol was detected in the vitreous, and 33.4 (ug/ml, ug/g) salicylate was detected in the urine. (Salicylate is a metabolite of aspirin.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMedical History&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the medical records from the pilot's primary care physician found that, in March 2011, a coronary calcium score test was ordered to evaluate the pilot's risk of coronary artery disease. The result was a total coronary artery calcium score of 919, which included 361 in the right coronary and 335 in the left anterior descending. (According to the record, a total score over 400 indicates a very high likelihood of significant atherosclerosis in at least one main coronary artery.) The pilot subsequently underwent a stress test on March 25, 2011, and exercised to 14.9 metabolic equivalents of task without symptoms. The electrocardiogram (ECG) portion of the test demonstrated some non-diagnostic ST segment depression inferiorly at peak heart rate and during the post-exercise recovery period. (The ST segment is the section of an ECG between the end of the S wave and the beginning of the T wave.) A note from the physician in the record suggested that this was a thallium stress test, but the record contained no radiology report.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the records, on March 6, 2012, the pilot's blood pressure was 142/80. On April 30, 2013, the pilot underwent a physical examination that was unremarkable. A letter from the physician to the pilot described an elevated glucose level, but the record contained no laboratory results that specified the glucose level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA research study published in 2012 found that the sensitivity for stress testing for significant stenosis is 77%, even when the person reaches maximal exertion and with the addition of nuclear imaging (a thallium stress test). (Source: Al Aloul et al. 2012. \"Utility of nuclear stress imaging for detecting coronary artery bypass graft disease.\" BMC Cardiovascular Disorders, 12:62.) - The closest official weather observation station was located at BCV. At 1416, BCV reported, in part, that the wind was from 300° at 3 knots, visibility was 10 miles, the sky condition was clear, the temperature was 57° F, and the dew point was 43° F.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of FAA weather camera images for BCV revealed that, for all camera views (northeast, northwest, south, and southeast), images taken about the time of accident (from about 7 minutes before to about 1 minute after) showed that clouds were present at the airport with no visibility restrictions below them. Rising terrain 11 miles south and 6 miles northeast, as well as a 4,400-ft mean sea level peak 7.5 miles southeast of the airport, were identifiable in the images. (Note: None of the cameras captured any detailed image of the accident helicopter.) - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a rating for rotorcraft helicopter. He held a second-class Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airman medical certificate issued April 1, 2014, with the limitation \"must wear corrective lenses.\" The pilot's logbook recorded that his most recent flight review, as required by Special Federal Aviation Regulation 73, Section 2(c)(2) and (3), was completed in the Robinson R-44 on July 1, 2013.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's logbook, as of May 23, 2014, the pilot had accumulated 2,174 hours total flight time, including 2,061.3 hours pilot-in-command (PIC) time, all of which was in helicopters. All of the pilot's flight time recorded in the logbook (which was the second book of two and began with an entry dated April 30, 2010, and 656.5 total flight hours) was accumulated in Robinson R-44 helicopters (primarily, the accident helicopter). The pilot completed a Robinson Helicopter Company pilot safety course and R-44 flight training in November 2008.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the 90 days before the accident, the pilot had accumulated 59.5 hours, and his logbook indicated that most of these flights involved proficiency practice such as autorotations, hover maneuvers, and flights with a 50-, 100-, or 150-ft long-line. The pilot had conducted seven flights (including the accident flight) with a 150-foot long-line in the accident helicopter in the 2 weeks before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's spouse, the day of the accident was a normal day for the pilot. She said that he typically slept about 8 hours per night, had gone to bed before 2300 the night before the accident, and had awakened about 0630 that morning, which was typical for him. She could recall nothing abnormal about his schedule or sleep in the days before the accident. She noted that he was interested in being proficient with the long-line because he had an upcoming project that would involve lowering an all-terrain-vehicle (ATV) to a site, and he wanted to make sure he would not damage the ATV in the process. She said that the pilot had been researching the way that the barrel swings, even studying at home how a weighted string reacts to motion. She described his interest in the long-line training and research as excitement, not concern or apprehension.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's spouse described that the pilot was very dedicated to keeping in shape and staying healthy and that he exercised regularly. She said that he had no recent health concerns other than mild cold- or pollen-related symptoms within the past 6 weeks, but the symptoms had cleared.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn response to questions, the pilot's spouse stated that her husband did not have a cardiologist, only a primary care physician. She recalled that the pilot had some kind of heart-related \"scare\" perhaps 3 or 4 years before the accident and that the primary care physician performed testing on the pilot at that time. She recalled that some of the tests performed may have been subject to misreading and had to be done again or followed by other tests, but she could not recall specifics. She described that the pilot had regular follow-up screenings from his primary physician. - Hydraulic Servos for Main Rotor Flight Controls&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVisual examination of the three D212-1 hydraulic servos (forward right, forward left, and aft servo) at the Robinson Helicopter factory revealed nominal impact-related damage. The fluid inlet screen for each servo was clear, and the hardware torque stripe on each was unbroken. All three servos were fitted with factory fluid fittings and supply and discharge hoses and were connected to a factory hydraulic test bench for functional testing. The testing revealed that all three servos functioned within limits with no anomalies noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nClutch Strut&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the clutch strut under magnification in the NTSB Materials Laboratory showed linear scrape damage across one side of the strut fittings at one end. - Initial examination of the helicopter at the accident site revealed that the fuselage came to rest on its left side on a gravel area south of the paved airport ramp, and most of the cockpit and cabin structures were consumed by fire. The engine and skids were on the ground near the fuselage and showed thermal damage. The tailcone and tail rotor were primarily intact and on the ground aft of the burned fuselage, which was generally oriented facing northwest. A linear scar was adjacent to the burned fuselage; the length of the scar was consistent with the length of a main rotor blade. The main rotor gearbox and mast assembly with the main rotor hub attached was found separated on the ground an estimated 100 ft north of fuselage and engine, at the edge of the paved ramp and adjacent to a separated taxiway light. One main rotor blade was separated outboard of the hub near the blade root, and the other main rotor blade was attached in its entirety and damaged. All separated pieces of main rotor blade were located at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe barrel with which the pilot had been practicing was found on its side in the grass adjacent to the airport ramp. (A witness reported that the pilot typically lowered the barrel such that it remained upright.) The barrel, a 55-gallon steel drum, was about three-quarters filled (estimated) with water. The long-line was attached to the barrel, and the other end was not attached to the helicopter's cargo hook. The line extended on the ground from the barrel generally southwest toward the main wreckage and was looped on the ground adjacent to the main wreckage; the end of the line was on the ground about 20 ft southwest of the main wreckage. Visual examination of the ramp area, barrel, and line revealed no scrape, drag, or contact marks that could be identified as uniquely associated with the accident. (The ramp area had multiple scrape marks, most of which were presumably from winter snow removal activity, and the barrel had multiple scrape marks in several areas.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the long-line revealed it consisted of three 50-foot sections of 3/8-inch braided nylon rope, each of which included a 1/2-inch rope thimble spliced at each end. The ropes were connected together by aluminum carabiners with locking gates. The barrel end of the long-line was attached to a hook through two aluminum carabiners with locking gates and a swivel adapter between them. The hook was attached to a barrel harness, which was secured around the barrel. The helicopter end of the long-line terminated at the 1/2-inch rope thimble with no ring or other rigging structure attached.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the wreckage at a recovery facility revealed that the upper and left sides of the airframe sustained extensive impact damage. The main rotor drive shaft was crushed and bent about 15° at the teeter stop. The three D212-1 hydraulic servos (forward right, forward left, and aft servo) for the main rotor flight controls were removed from the wreckage and retained for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne main rotor blade was attached to the root and fractured in two places with its fractured segments attached by the trailing edge doublers. The separated surfaces were angular and jagged, and the blade was bowed upward about 6 ft outboard of the hub, and the outboard 6 ft were bent forward in the direction of rotation. The leading edge had many small dents with coarse scuff marks running chordwise along the entire blade. There was a large puncture in the blade afterbody from the upper skin into the lower skin. The other main rotor blade was separated near the root, and the separations were angular and jagged. Both the inboard side and the outboard side of the disconnect had corresponding coarse scuff marks running mostly chordwise on the upper skin. This blade was bent forward in the direction of rotation at mid-span, and the afterbody in the same area was fractured from the trailing edge toward the spar at a slight angle. The surfaces of the fractured skins were angular and jagged. The leading edge of the upper skin at the tip had coarse scuff marks running chordwise, and the trailing edge was deformed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailcone sustained thermal damage at the forward end and was separated from the upper frame at the thermally damaged area. The intermediate flex coupling was mostly consumed by fire along with the forward end of the tail rotor driveshaft. The tail rotor driveshaft was bowed slightly. The tail rotor driveshaft damper bearing rotated smoothly, and the hanger bracket functioned freely. The aft flex coupling was undamaged. The tail rotor gearbox input gear and cartridge was separated from the tail rotor gearbox housing and remained attached to the bulkhead. The surface of the separation was angular and jagged. The input gear rotated smoothly and had no damage to the teeth. The output gear was undamaged. The output shaft was bent. Oil, blue in color, was present around the gearbox. The tail rotor hub and both blades had coarse scuff marks on their outboard surfaces. One tail rotor blade was slightly deformed along the trailing edge, and the other had a dent in the leading edge.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing gear sustained only thermal damage. The rear cross tube, both rear elbows, and most of the forward cross tube were consumed by fire. The bottom surface of the tail skid had a fresh scrape mark.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe clutch strut was found attached at one end to the frame assembly and was retained for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed extensive thermal damage. All of the accessories were partially or fully consumed by fire, and both oil coolers and the oil sump were consumed by fire. The crankshaft could be rotated, and valve continuity was established. Compression (thumb check) was observed on the Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 cylinders. During the check, debris blew out the intake for the No. 3 cylinder, and examination revealed the No. 3 intake tube had been displaced. The oil pump turned freely. The spark plugs showed normal wear. The oil filter element and oil strainer showed no metallic debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operating components of the cargo hook were found separated from each other with some pieces fragmented and encased in molten metal. Damage precluded any functional testing. The pilot's cyclic grip with the cargo hook release button mount was thermally damaged. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was conducting an aerial application flight. A witness reported observing the helicopter crossing over a highway that bordered a large field that the helicopter was spraying. The witness added that the helicopter was about three-quarters of the way down the field when it appeared to \"hop.\" As the helicopter ascended, it appeared to veer right, and it then continued to ascend to about twice the height of nearby trees while rapidly spinning in circles. The witness lost sight of the helicopter when his vehicle passed trees alongside the road. After passing the trees, the witness looked back and saw smoke coming from a farm building. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring an examination of the accident scene, a portion of one of the tail rotor blades was found at the base of a tree located on the west edge of the field. Cut and broken branches were found distributed westward from the tree along the ground. The helicopter was found embedded in the roof of a metal building about 70 yards west of the tree. An examination of the helicopter systems revealed no preimpact anomalies. It is likely that, on completion of his aerial application pass, the pilot did not pull the helicopter up in time to avoid the tree located at the edge of the field that he was spraying.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The helicopter was a Texas Helicopter Corp OH-13H/M74A. The two-place, single-engine helicopter, serial number 78-021 was manufactured in 1978, and had a restricted special airworthiness certificate for the purpose of agricultural pest control, dated May 17, 2000.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was powered by one Lycoming VO-435-A1F fuel-injected 4-cylinder horizontally opposed reciprocating engine, serial number L083-31, rated at 260 horsepower at 3,200 rpm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter's logbook, the helicopter underwent a 100 hour/annual inspection on May 2, 2014. The helicopter's total time at the annual inspection was 7,686.0 hours, and the hour meter was 2,434.1 hours. The hour meter observed at the accident indicated 2,445.7 hours. - On May 28, 2014 about 1015 central daylight time, a Texas Helicopter Corp OH-13H/M74A agricultural helicopter, N51853, registered to the pilot, sustained substantial damage following a collision with trees and a building near Little Falls, Minnesota. The commercial pilot sustained serious injuries in the accident, was hospitalized, and later succumbed to those injuries. The aerial application flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137. No flight plan was filed and visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. The flight originated at 0945 from a nearby private agricultural staging area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness traveling in his vehicle on a nearby highway saw the helicopter cross the highway and proceed in the direction of farm building that bordered a large field that the helicopter was spraying at the time. The witness said the helicopter was about 3/4 of the way down the field when it appeared to \"hop,\" like it encountered an area of rising air. As the helicopter ascended it appeared to veer to the right. When the witness looked over at the helicopter again, it had pulled up to about twice the height of the trees, near the trees, and was rapidly spinning in circles. The witness lost sight of the helicopter when his vehicle passed trees alongside the road. After passing the trees, the witness looked back and saw smoke coming from one of the farm buildings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe chemical truck operator who worked for the pilot stated they were staging about 1/2 mile from the field the pilot was spraying. He said there was nothing wrong with the pilot or helicopter on that day, nor did the pilot mention having any issues with the helicopter. He said that the pilot should have been mostly done treating the field at the time of the accident. He also said that the pilot was spraying the field in a direction that would have taken him over the field toward the farm buildings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0944, the helicopter pilot contacted the Miller Army Air Field advisory frequency and informed them that he was going to be spraying a field northeast of the airfield and that he would be operating below100 ft for about an hour, and would call them after he was done. The advisory controller told the pilot that the nearby restricted area was active, the wind was 040 degrees at 5 knots, and the altimeter was 30.11 inches. The advisory controller said that was the only communications that she had with the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLocal law enforcement arrived on the scene to find the helicopter impacted into the roof of an all-metal pole shed. The pilot was found strapped in the helicopter pilot seat, unconscious, breathing, and with a pulse. The pilot was transported by helicopter to St. Cloud, Minnesota. The pilot subsequently died on June 5, 2014. - The pilot died 8 days after the accident. The results of an autopsy performed on the pilot on June 6, 2014 by the Ramsey County, Minnesota, Medical Examiner, St. Paul, Minnesota, showed the cause of death to be complications of a closed head injury due to a helicopter crash.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute performed forensic toxicology on specimens from the pilot. The following drugs detected in fluids and tissues were the result of treatment administered to the pilot in the attempt to save his life:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAtropine detected in Blood (Heart)&#x0D;\nDoxazosin detected in Liver&#x0D;\nDoxazosin detected in Blood (Heart)&#x0D;\n0.086 (ug/ml, ug/g) Lorazepam detected in Liver&#x0D;\n0.027 (ug/ml, ug/g) Lorazepam detected in Blood (Heart)&#x0D;\nMorphine detected in Liver&#x0D;\nMorphine detected in Blood (Heart) - At 0959, the Routine Aviation Weather Observation at Little Falls, Minnesota, 10 miles south of the accident site, was wind 100 degrees at 3 knots, clear skies, 10 statute miles visibility, temperature 66 degrees Fahrenheit (F), dew point 43 degrees F, and altimeter 30.09 inches Hg. - The pilot, age 71, held a commercial pilot certificate with airplane, single-engine land and rotorcraft helicopter ratings. According to the pilot's logbook, the pilot had recorded approximately 17,370 total flying hours and 4,500 hours in the accident helicopter make and model. He had recorded having flown 25 hours in the preceding 90 days. The pilot successfully completed a flight review on April 1, 2013.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a valid second-class medical certificate dated March 24, 2014, with a limitation for corrective lenses. - The wreckage debris path began with a large tree located 70 yards east-southeast of the helicopter main wreckage. Part of one of the tail rotor blades and several cut branches were located at the base of the tree. Cut and broken tree branches were found west of the tree along a line that ran toward the farm buildings. The main wreckage included the cabin, fuselage and tail boom, main rotor system, and the majority of the tail rotor system. The helicopter cabin, fuselage with the engine, transmission, and fuel tank, and the tail boom aft of the fuel tank, were embedded in the roof of a metal pole shed. The remainder of the tail boom and tail rotor rested against the east wall of the building, just beneath the helicopter cabin and fuselage. The main rotor was separated from the transmission and rested in a tree just adjacent to the main wreckage. The tree showed cuts and breakage from the helicopter impact. Flight control continuity was confirmed. The engine, transmission, and other helicopter systems were examined following removal of the helicopter from the building. The examination showed no pre-impact anomalies. -",

It is likely that the pilot did not see the power lines as he was flying along the river at low altitude. It was unknown why the pilot was flying at such a low altitude.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On May 23, 2014, about 1030 Pacific daylight time, a Robinson R22 helicopter, N4081H, collided with overhead distribution power lines and terrain while maneuvering west of the Santa Paula Airport (SZP) Santa Paula, California. The certified commercial pilot, the sole occupant of the helicopter, was fatally injured. The helicopter was substantially damaged. The helicopter was registered to Sierra Flite, LLC, Camden, Delaware, and operated by Channel Islands Helicopters, LLC, Oxnard, California, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and no flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Oxnard Airport (OXR) Oxnard, California about 0930.According to Channel Islands Helicopters, the pilot departed OXR after refueling, and flew in the area near the Camarillo Airport, Camarillo, California (CMA), where he then departed for SZP. The helicopter was refueled at OXR with 15.8 gallons of 100LL. The pilot was building time towards his rotorcraft commercial rating.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who lived near the accident site, saw the helicopter flying in a northeasterly direction paralleling her property. The helicopter was below the tree line on the opposite side of the riverbed and was descending. The witness stated that the helicopter sounded normal but was unusually loud because it was so close. Shortly after losing sight of the helicopter, she heard two loud \"pops.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to local law enforcement, three phase overhead distribution power lines were separated directly over the accident site. These lines were supported by two wooden H-frame pole assemblies at a distance of about 1,000 feet from each other and about 80 feet over the dry river bed. The separated power lines were found in the surrounding bamboo vegetation and trees adjacent to the riverbed. Near the northern positioned H-frame, small spot fires were reported in the surrounding vegetation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 42, held a commercial certificate with an airplane single-engine land, single-engine sea, multi-engine land, rotorcraft, and instrument ratings. A second-class airman medical certificate was issued in March 2, 2011, with no limitations. The pilot reported on his most recent medical certificate application that he had accumulated 4,628 total flight hours and 56 hours in rotorcraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, received his Private-Rotorcraft rating on May 2, 2014 and the accident flight was his second flight since his rating.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's logbook, the pilot had received ground school and training and was endorsed to fly the R-22 under a special federal aviation regulation 73 (SFAR-73) in February of 2014. The SFAR-73 ensures minimum levels of training and experience for students, pilots, and flight instructors for the Robinson R-22 and R-44.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe two-seat, helicopter, serial number (S/N) 1927, was manufactured in 1991. A review of the maintenance logbooks indicated that the helicopter had a total airframe time of 4,322 hours at the last 100-hour inspection on March 29, 2014. The Hobbs meter read 4,375 at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt was powered by a Lycoming O-320-B2C engine, serial number L-17962-39A, rated at 160 horsepower. Total time recorded on the engine at the 100-hour inspection on March 29, 2014 was 4,322 hours and time since major overhaul was 122 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of recorded data from the CMA automated weather observation station revealed at 0955 conditions were wind from 200 degrees at 7 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, clear sky, temperature 18° Celsius, dew point 12° Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.01 inches of Mercury. At 1055 conditions were wind 240 at 9 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, clear sky, temperature 19° Celsius, dew point 12° Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.03 inches of Mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCOMMUNICATIONS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA VFR flight plan was not filed and no ATC communication took place.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRPORT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Santa Paula Airport, SZP, is a public, uncontrolled airport located in Santa Paula, California, at a surveyed elevation of 243 feet.

Also, 1,500 ft and 2.5 miles NE [northeast] apch [approach] end of ry [runway] 22.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter collided with overhead distribution power lines and terrain on a heading of about 60 degrees magnetic. The wreckage debris path was oriented on an approximate heading of 58 degrees magnetic and was about 170 feet in length. A small section of power line was found about 90 feet from where the power lines would have crossed the dry river bed. About 40 feet further from the section of power line was the first identified point of contact (FIPC) with the ground. The FIPC with the ground revealed several disturbances in the sand and rocks measuring 2 to 3 feet in length and about 3-5 inches in depth. Pieces of the right navigation light lens and the right door were found at the FIPC. A pitch change linkage and a compass instrument were found near the FIPC. Extending about 35 feet further from the FIPC with the ground was the main wreckage. The fuselage came to rest on its right side on a heading of about 65 degrees magnetic. The tailboom was partially separated and buckled near the fuselage and came to rest on a forward heading of about 335 degrees magnetic. The tail rotor assembly, vertical and horizontal stabilizers and the stinger were undamaged. The main rotors remained attached to the mast and were damaged. The forward positioned blade remained intact with leading edge and trailing edge damage. Cable strike marks were visible on the top side of the blade. The aft positioned blade was bent about 90 degrees and about 4 feet of the blade tip was missing. Cable strikes and gouging were noted on the main rotor blade. The blade also had an arc (electrical) mark on the trailing edge. The blade tip was not found during the examination of the accident site. The swash plate linkages were damaged and the mast shroud near the swash plate had cable strike marks. The engine remained attached to the fuselage and impact damage was noted on the induction box and fan shroud. The oil cooler had impact marks from the starter ring gear. The marks showed evidence of rotation of the starter ring gear during contact. The motor from the belt tensioner assembly separated and was found near the main wreckage. Both drive belts were unseated from both engine and drive sheaves. The instrument panel and the forward section of the right skid were found between the FIPC with the ground and the main wreckage. A large section of the right skid was found on the north side of the debris field. The remaining landing gear was separated from, but entangled with the fuselage. A landing gear attachment and a section of a droop stop tusk were found on the south side of the debris field. Plexiglas sections were found throughout the debris field. The battery box, battery and antenna were found further down the debris field from the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cable separations were examined and a blue colored paint transfer was found on the 3rd line or most easterly positioned line.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was recovered to Air Transport in Phoenix, Arizona for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe County of Ventura conducted an autopsy on the pilot on May 27, 2014. The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was \"Blunt Force Trauma.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology tests on the pilot. According to CAMI's report, carbon monoxide, cyanide, volatiles, and drugs were tested, and had negative results.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFIRE&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the local fire department, small spot fires were ignited by the downed wires in the surrounding vegetation near the northern positioned H-frame pole assembly and were quickly extinguished.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFOLLOWUP EXAMINATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the recovered wreckage was conducted on June 5, 2014, at the facilities of Air Transport, Phoenix, Arizona, by a representative from the Robinson Helicopter Company, under the supervision of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC). The examination did not reveal any evidence of any preexisting mechanical malfunction which would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 3, 2011, about 2021 Pacific daylight time, a Cessna 180D, N6451X, was substantially damaged when it struck a telephone line supported from the two wooden H-frame pole assemblies. The airplane departed SZP and was flying southwest over the riverbed before colliding with the telephone line. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was repositioning the helicopter and advised ground personnel that he intended to land and perform a \"fluid check.\" Company personnel reported that most pilots used this term when they intended to land away from the awaiting passengers and exit the helicopter to relieve themselves. The pilots would generally leave the engine running when outside the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an on board video recording system. The recording revealed that the pilot landed the helicopter in a location that had a direct buffeting crosswind. The pilot tightened the friction on the cyclic, which then did not move. The twist grip light illuminated, and engine audio was consistent with the throttle being moved toward ground idle. About 6 seconds later, the twist grip light extinguished, engine audio was consistent with an increase in power to flight idle; engine data parameters indicate that the twist grip was moved to flight idle. On the video, the collective position continued to increase. About 15 seconds later, the pilot exited the helicopter. External audio indicated a sound similar to N1 increasing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor the next 24 seconds, the video showed an increase in airframe buffeting. The helicopter then began to pitch nose down. One second later, the helicopter began to roll right; the roll increased, and the helicopter then began to yaw left. The sound of the door opening was heard, likely indicating that the pilot attempted to enter the helicopter. The helicopter continued to roll and yaw until noises consistent with the rotor blades impacting the ground were heard.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator had a policy that required a pilot to always be at the controls of a running helicopter. However, according to pilot interviews, this policy was not generally followed, and the pilots would not shut down the helicopter when they needed to relieve themselves. However, pilots who were interviewed stated that they would leave the helicopter operating at ground idle. It could not be determined why the pilot would leave the helicopter while it was operating at flight idle without the flight controls properly secured.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 18, 2014, about 1600 mountain standard time (MST), an American Eurocopter Corp, AS350B3E, N840PA, rolled over after landing at the Ramada landing site located at the bottom of the Grand Canyon near Grand Canyon West Airport (1G4), Peach Springs, Arizona. Papillon Airways Inc., DBA Grand Canyon Helicopters, was operating the helicopter under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The commercial pilot with a flight instructor (FI) certificate was fatally injured; the helicopter sustained substantial damage. The local repositioning flight departed 1G4 about 1555. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and a company flight plan had been filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was 1.75 nm east of 1G4, located at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, approximately 380 feet west of the Colorado River (west shore). The wreckage was found resting on its right side located at the subject landing pad.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses reported that the pilot reported over the radio that he was inbound to land, and was planning on exiting the helicopter to perform a \"fluid level check.\" After landing, the pilot exited the running helicopter; the helicopter was observed going airborne and then impacting the ground and rolling over.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was struck by one or more of the main rotor blades, and was fatally injured. The helicopter was examined on site by the investigation team. No abnormalities with the helicopter's airframe or engine systems were noted. The helicopter was recovered for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that the 26-year old pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft and instrument rotorcraft. The pilot held a flight instructor certificate with ratings for rotorcraft and instrument rotorcraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a first-class medical certificate issued on June 12, 2013. It had no limitations or waivers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that the pilot had a total flight time of 2,125.3 hours. He logged 195.3 hours in the last 90 days, and 79.6 in the last 30 days. He had an estimated 142.5 hours in this make and model. He completed a FAR 135 proficiency flight check on April 17, 2014.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was an American Eurocopter AS350B3, serial number 7718. The helicopter's Hobbs meter indicated a total airframe time of 102.8 hours since new. The starting Hobbs for the day of the accident was 97.1 hours. The pilot had flown a total of 5.7 hours on the day of the accident. The helicopter was first registered as new by the operator in January 2014. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an Appareo Vision 1000 cockpit imaging and flight data monitoring device. The Appareo device was undamaged, and sent to the NTSB Vehicle Recorders Laboratory in Washington, DC for data extraction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a 406-mhz Emergency Location Transmitter (ELT). The Armed Forces Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) received the ELT activation at 2300z (1600 hours MST.) The first activation did not have any latitude or longitude information. However, the second activation was received at 2329z, which was 29 minutes after the accident with lat/lon data that was 1,500 yards north of the accident site. The ELT did not assist in locating the accident site due to prior reporting by on scene witnesses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCOCKPIT IMAGE DATA RECORDER&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe complete factual report of investigation for the onboard image recorder is attached to the docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Appareo Vision 1000 device is a small self-contained image, audio, and data recorder. The unit is typically mounted in the overhead of an aircraft's cockpit, and records a cockpit image at a rate of four times per second. In addition to cockpit images, the device is also capable of recording two tracks of audio that are synchronized with the image data. The unit also contains a GPS receiver that receives GPS satellite based aircraft time, position, altitude, and speed. In addition to the GPS position, the Appareo unit also has a self-contained real-time inertial measuring unit that provides 3-axis accelerations as well as aircraft pitch, roll, and yaw data.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTrack one of the Appareo Vision 1000 recorder is available to be connected to an external audio source such as the aircraft's intercom or radios. Track two records audio picked up by a microphone mounted internal to the Vision 1000 unit. In this installation, no external audio was connected to track one, and the track two microphone only picked up very loud engine/transmission sounds from the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe  Appareo  unit  records  the  image,  audio,  and  parametric  data  on  a removable  SD  memory  card  that  is  inserted  into  the  unit. This removable memory retains approximately the last 2 hours of image and audio data, and about the last 100 hours of parametric data. In addition to the removable memory, the Vision 1000 is also equipped with a crash and fire resistant memory module that is mounted internal to the unit. This internal memory contains an exact duplicate of the data stored on the removable card.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Appareo unit on this helicopter was connected to its battery through the master battery switch. Anytime the battery switch was turned on, the Appareo unit started to record audio, images, and data. The Vision 1000 unit created a new file for every electrical power application. Some of the recorded files were flights, and some of the files were just short power cycles of the helicopter's battery.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident recording captured the helicopter operating in a circular route between 1G4 and an alternate helipad operated by Papillon Airways. The rotorcraft flew a circular pattern between the two landing zones either ferrying passengers or company employees between the two areas. The recording captured 16.5 complete laps of the circular pattern, and included 36 landings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, an event similar to the accident portion of the flight was discovered on the audio/video recording, and was summarized in section 5.2 of the docket report. This event occurred around 14:26:28.76 MST, and began with the rotorcraft touching down at the alternate landing zone near the rafting facility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe previous event that was captured by the Appareo Vision 1000 device that occurred approximately 1.5 hours prior to the accident event was reviewed by the video group. This event was captured in the same flight file that contained the accident. It was chosen that this portion of the flight be closely reviewed as it captured the only other time on the recording when the accident pilot exited the cockpit of the rotorcraft while the rotorcraft was running. This event began at 3:08:44.51 video elapsed time, and the instrument mounted analog clock read 14:30:20 MST when the pilot touched down at the LVH Pad in the same direction and orientation as the accident portion.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll engine operating parameters appeared normal and consistent with the rotorcraft operating in flight idle. No caution or warning lights appeared illuminated on the caution/warning panel. The air conditioning compressor operation status lights were illuminated indicating that the compressor was operating. The yaw yarn was noted moving on the windscreen in the same manner as during the accident portion of the recording.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe significant differences noted by the group between this particular event and the accident event were as follows:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    •     The rotorcraft remained at flight idle during the entire duration in which the rotorcraft was on the pad.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    \n    •     The pilot did not reach for or manipulate the horn switch.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    \n    •     No changes in Engine Generator Speed (N1) ambient audio or related helicopter instrumentation were noted during the time the rotorcraft was on the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    \n    •     Sounds were consistent with a forward door opening and remaining open during the time the pilot was outside the view of the camera. No significant buffeting or resonance while the rotorcraft was on the ground was noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    \n    •     The pilot was not visible in the camera's field of view for approximately 44 seconds. In the accident portion, approximately 22 seconds elapsed from the time when the pilot departed the view of the camera until the upset of the rotorcraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    \n    •     The pilot re-entered the cockpit, put on his headset and belted in.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The rotorcraft lifted off the pad at a video elapsed time of approximately 3:10:49.26 (14:28:33.51 MST). The instrument panel clock read approximately 2:31:25.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The transcribed portion of the accident flight recording began at 15:51:46.26 MST when the rotorcraft touched down at (1G4), and ended shortly after the accident when the unit stopped recording at 15:13:48.76 MST.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The accident flight began with the helicopter landing at 1G4, and the passengers debarked with the assistance of external personnel. The helicopter departed from 1G4, and flew to the landing zone, which was located near the Ramada Dock on the Colorado River at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. The pilot was observed making his approach to the landing zone with no aircraft abnormalities noted. There were two wind socks near the landing zone, which indicated a steady wind of 15-20 knots blowing down river.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The pilot made his approach to the southernmost pad, which was the farthest pad from the North Ramada waiting area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    At 15:57:06.51, the rotorcraft touched down at the North Ramada/LVH Pad. The Vehicle Engine Management Display (VEMD) indications responded as expected for a normal touchdown. The altimeter indicated approximately 1,590 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The pilot removed his right hand from the cyclic while the cyclic was free and unfrictioned, and held it with his left hand. The pilot reached down with his right hand while leaning forward in the seat, and made a ratcheting motion, which was consistent with tightening the friction on the cyclic stick.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The pilot then leaned back in the seat, and removed his right foot from the tail rotor pedal. His left foot was still on the left pedal. His hands were off the cyclic, and the cyclic did not appear to move.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The pilot's shoulder harness straps were visible over his shoulders. The pilot glanced downward, a reflection consistent with the pilot removing his shoulder harness was visible in the airspeed gauge.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    At 15:57:12.26, the red colored \"TWT GRIP\" light (Twist Grip Light) illuminated on the annunciator panel. Engine audio was consistent with the reduction of N1 toward ground idle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The pilot reached for the 30 Alpha Panel with his right hand, and switched the HORN switch \"Off\". The pilot moved his head out of the line of sight of the camera, and the amber colored \"HORN\" light was illuminated on the annunciator panel. Turbine Output Temperature (TOT) on the VEMD showed a drop along with the Rotor Speed (Nr) gauge consistent with a selection of ground idle.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    At 15:57:13, the Engine Data Recorder for collective position showed a slight increase indicating the collective handle had become unlocked.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The red colored trim yarn was observed outside the windscreen center post at the 3 o'clock position and buffeting indicating a crosswind from the left. This was observed for the duration of the recording.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    At 15:57:18.01, the red colored \"TWT GRIP\" light extinguished on the annunciator panel. Engine audio was consistent with an increase and acceleration of N1 toward flight idle. The TOT indication on the VEMD gauge began to trend up along with the free turbine speed N2/Nr gauge. Engine oil pressure began to climb slightly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The pilot reached for the 30 Alpha Panel with his right hand, and switched the HORN switch \"On\". The annunciator panel came into view. No lights were illuminated on the panel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The pilot reached for and removed his headset. The pilot placed foam earplugs in his ears. The pilot moved his head, and looked down and to the left while he moved his body slightly to the right. A sound similar to a door latch operating and an increase in ambient rotorcraft noise was heard.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    At 15:57:33.76, the pilot began to exit the camera's field of view to the left of the rotorcraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The pilot was no longer visible in the camera's field of view. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Between 15:57:37.01 and 15:57:47.26, the rotorcraft's airframe was observed slightly buffeting in reference to the ground, which was visible outside the windscreen. Approximately a needle's width increase was observed on the TOT. The Torque (TRQ) was observed increasing about a needle's width. The N1 gauge remained at the bottom of the scale. External audio indicated a sound similar to N1 increasing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    At 15:57:38.26, a sound similar to a door latch operating and a decrease in ambient rotorcraft noise was heard.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Between 15:57:47.50 and 15:57:56.26, an increase in airframe buffeting was observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The rotorcraft began to pitch nose down. One second later, the pitch down continued, and the rotorcraft rolled slightly right. Then as it continued to pitch nose down, a roll increase to the right was observed, and a yaw motion to the left began.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    At 15:57:58.26, a sound similar to a door latch operating was heard, and an increase in ambient engine noise was heard.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The rotorcraft continued to pitch forward and yaw to the left. Roll increased to the right. The pilot's left leg and brown shorts were visible in the left chin bubble. The pilot appeared to be facing toward the back of the rotorcraft. At this point, the Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) indicated that the rotorcraft had yawed approximately 20 - 25° left. The attitude deviation indicator showed approximately 20° nose down and about a 20° angle of bank to the right.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The report described the continuing movements of the helicopter until noises consistent with rotor blades impact with the ground were heard.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    ENGINE DATA RECORDER&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The Engine Data Recorder (EDR) is an electronic component of the Turbomeca Arriel 2D engine that stores critical flight and engine operation data. The EDR is driven by the Electronic Engine Control Unit (EECU) which records data into the EDR. The EECU also provides the engine data values stored in the EDR to the avionics.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    A copy of the EDR report is attached to the accident docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    A portion of the report data shows the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The rotorcraft lifted off around 15:52:45. Recorded engine values for this portion of flight responded normally and as expected.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    By 15:57:07, the collective was once again shown in a lowered position consistent with the rotorcraft performing a landing. The value for Twist Grip Mode transitioned from a value of \"Flight\" to \"Idle\" shortly thereafter. During this time, recorded collective position began to increase slightly. In the same region of the plot, Twist Grip Mode transitioned from \"Idle\" to \"Acceleration\" and then to \"Flight\" by 15:57:23. Recorded values for Collective Position began to rise more abruptly. Around 15:58:01, recorded values for Rotor RPM decline sharply. At this time, recorded collective position was changing rapidly. Around 15:58:06, values for Rotor RPM declined abruptly for a second time. Values for Rotor RPM then dropped to zero for the remainder of the recording.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    WRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Investigators examined the wreckage at the accident scene.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The main wreckage was located at 35 59.717N, 113 46.914W, at an elevation of 1,288 msl as recorded by a handheld GPS.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The wreckage was observed at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, approximately 380 feet west of the Colorado River (west shore). The wreckage was found resting on its right side located at the subject landing pad (hard ground, dirt pad outlined by stones). The helicopter came to rest on a heading of 200 degrees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The main rotor assembly exhibited a high power setting type of damage; all damage observed was a consequence similar to that of the ground contact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Both main cabin doors were found open. The hydraulic 'Isolation' switch on the collective was in its normal position (not activated).  The 'Accumulator Test' switch was in its normal position (not activated). The 'EBCAU Test' switch was still safetied and in its normal position (not activated). All circuit breakers were in their correct operating positions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The helicopter had departed 1G4 with approximately 480 pounds of Jet-A fuel. The fuel tank of the helicopter was not compromised during the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    No pre-mishap anomalies were noted with the airframe, the power plant, or the flight control systems.  The cabin volume and the majority of the helicopter's structure were relatively intact. All the helicopter's parts and components were accounted for and located in the immediate vicinity of the main wreckage (within approximately two main rotor blade diameters).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    MEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The Mohave County Medical Examiner completed an autopsy on May 20, 2014, with a cause of death due to multiple injuries as a result of the accident.  The FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological testing on specimens of the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Analysis of the specimens contained no findings for carbon monoxide, volatiles, and tested drugs. They did not perform tests for cyanide.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    TESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The company had a requirement of landing and shutting down the engine to check the fluid levels of the helicopter every few hours. A review of witness statements and interviews with Papillon personnel revealed a pilot culture in which the line pilots used \"fluid checks\" as a code for the pilots going to relieve themselves.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The line pilot culture was to tell the loaders on the radio that they were going to do a \"fluid check,\" but cryptically it was known that they would not be shutting down. They would leave the helicopter running while they relieved themselves.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The \"fluid check\" procedure being used by most of the pilots was to land away from passengers, leave the helicopter running, exit the helicopter, relieve themselves, return to the helicopter, and reposition the helicopter to pick up the passengers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    All of the pilots who admitted to doing a \"fluid check\" did so with the helicopter at ground idle only. It was undetermined how long this procedure had been used by the line pilots.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    The investigation was unable to determine why the accident pilot kept the helicopter at flight idle while he performed the \"fluid check.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    A review of the company policies and procedures in effect at the time of the accident that referenced idling the engine were a result of the engine manufacturer's warning operators not to idle the engine longer than 30 seconds prior to shutting down the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    A portion of the Papillon Company SOP as of Jan 2014 reports the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Page 11- Heliport Procedures-&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Aircraft Idling: The twist-grip, or fuel control lever, will remain in the \"Flight\" position at all times. Idling the aircraft during hot loading, hot fueling or waiting on the ramp is not permitted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Page 13- Heliport Procedures-&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Control Holds: The PIC will remain at the controls until the rotors come to a complete stop. The only exceptions to this rule are \"Pilot Swaps\" and \"Control Holds\". In either case, the PIC will not leave the controls until all passengers are clear of the rotor disc. When giving a control hold, do not adjust any of the volume or selector switches in the aircraft. Control holds are permitted, but it is at the discretion of the PIC based on conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    As of May 04, 2015, a modification to the cooling down procedures was published by the operator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    A portion of the Papillon Additional Policies and Procedures as of May 2015 reports the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Page 32&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Cooldown Times: Pilots are required to comply with the following cooldown times: 3 minutes for B206L's, and 30 seconds for EC130/AS350. If an EC130/AS350 has been at idle for more than 15 minutes, the pilot will advance the twist grip to flight for one minute and then return back to idle for normal shutdown.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    ADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    As a result of this accident, Airbus reissued a Safety Information Notice SIN No. 2727-S-00 to all models of Airbus helicopters. The SIN states in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Helicopter certification regulations do not address the situation where an operating helicopter is left unattended on the ground i.e., without a qualified pilot at the controls. This situation is governed rather by rules which can vary greatly depending upon policies and procedures deemed acceptable by the appropriate airworthiness authority.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Because it is not the responsibility of Airbus Helicopters to define such policies or procedures, Airbus Helicopters will remove the following wording from all applicable aircraft Flight Manuals: \"Unless otherwise specified in applicable operational rules, one pilot should be at the controls as soon as the rotors turn until flight ends and the rotors are fully stopped.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Although this wording will be removed from the applicable aircraft Flight Manuals, Airbus Helicopters continues to believe that leaving a helicopter operating on the ground without a qualified pilot at the controls can be dangerous.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    This situation can result in damage to the helicopter and/or to other property, serious bodily injury, or death.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n    Consequently, Airbus Helicopters maintains that safety is greatly enhanced if there is always a qualified pilot at the controls of a helicopter whenever it is operating and the rotors are turning. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The student pilot was flying his single-seat helicopter as part of a flight of two helicopters with the intention of flying around the airport traffic pattern. Witnesses located adjacent to the accident site reported that, as both helicopters reached an altitude consistent with pattern altitude, the accident helicopter suddenly pitched down. One witness stated that the helicopter shuddered a few times and then pitched down while rolling in a clockwise rotation. The helicopter subsequently impacted flat desert terrain. Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of any preexisting mechanical anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The single-seat experimental amateur-built helicopter, serial number (S/N) 5-14, was completed in 2014, and issued an experimental airworthiness certificate on March 6, 2014. It was powered by a Solar T-62-32 turboshaft engine rated at 160 horsepower. Review of the airframe logbook revealed that since the issuance of the airworthiness certificate, no further logbook entries were made. - The Reno/Stead Airport is a non-towered airport that operates in class G airspace. The airport features two runways, 14/32, a 9,000-foot long and 150-foot wide asphalt runway, and 8/26, a 7,608-foot long and 150-foot wide asphalt runway. The reported airport elevation is 5,050 feet. - On April 13, 2014, about 1209 Pacific daylight time, an experimental amateur-built Sands Helicycle, N78CS, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain while maneuvering near the Reno-Stead Airport (RTS), Reno, Nevada. The helicopter was registered to and operated by the pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The student pilot, sole occupant of the single-seat helicopter, sustained fatal injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local personal flight, which originated from RTS at 1204.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses located adjacent to the accident site reported observing two helicopters fly along a taxiway about 15 feet above ground level (agl) on a southerly heading while in trail from one another. As the helicopters made a left turn to an easterly heading, they ascended to about 500 feet agl. As both helicopters turned to a northerly heading, the lead helicopter began to \"pull away\" from the second helicopter. Witnesses stated that the second helicopter suddenly pitched downward towards the ground. Subsequently, the helicopter impacted terrain about 1,425 feet northeast of the threshold of runway 32. One witness added that the accident helicopter \"shuttered a couple of times, [and] then dove at the ground\" while rolling in a clockwise rotation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot of the lead helicopter reported that the accident pilot and he departed from the west hangars to the east along taxiway Alpha. He stated that the accident pilot intended to follow him on a left traffic pattern for runway 08. As he turned crosswind for the runway, he asked the accident pilot if he was \"back there,\" and the accident pilot responded \"yes, I am behind you and everything is fine.\" The pilot further reported that he continued on downwind and made another radio call to the accident pilot, but did not receive a reply despite multiple attempts to contact him. Shortly thereafter, the pilot located the wreckage of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA friend of the pilot reported to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) that the morning of the day of the accident, the pilot had flown uneventfully around the airport and performed a few low speed quick stops on one of the taxiways. In addition, the friend of the pilot reported that the helicopter was test flown about a week prior to the accident by a test pilot, and the helicopter was within weight and balance limitations. - The Washoe County Medical Examiner conducted an autopsy on the pilot on April 14, 2014. The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was \"multiple blunt force injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology tests on the pilot. According to CAMI's report, carbon monoxide, cyanide, volatiles, and drugs were tested, and had positive results for an unspecified amount of Diphenhydramine within the liver.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInformation obtained from CAMI revealed that Diphenhydramine is a common over the counter antihistamine used in the treatment of the common cold and hay fever. In addition, warnings for the medication include: may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). - A review of recorded data from the Reno-Tahoe International Airport (RNO) automated weather observation station, located about 15 miles southeast of the accident site, revealed at 1155, conditions were wind from 130 degrees at 5 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, sky clear, temperature 13 degrees Celsius, dew point -12 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.19 inches of mercury. Using the reported weather conditions and field elevation, the calculated density altitude was about 5,751 feet. - The pilot, age 46, held a student pilot certificate with an endorsement for an R22 helicopter. A third-class airman medical certificate was issued to the pilot on November 30, 2012, with no limitations stated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the pilot's logbook revealed that as of the most recent logbook entry, dated March 23, 2014, he had accumulated 52.7 hours of total flight time, of which 4.6 hours was solo flight time. The pilot had logged 4.2 hours of flight time within the preceding 30 days to the accident, of which no solo flight time was logged. - Examination of the recovered airframe and engine was conducted at the Reno-Stead Airport, Reno, Nevada, on May 28, 2014, by the NTSB IIC, and a representative from Eagle R&amp;D.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the recovered wreckage revealed that one of the two main rotor blades was separated at the blade grip and the retention bolt was sheered. Signatures observed on the blade grip were consistent with the rotor blade separating in a forward direction. The upper, lower, and center portions of the retention bolt remained within the rotor blade and blade grip. The outboard three feet of the blade was separated, including the blade tip and leading edge spar, which was located about 300 feet southwest of the accident site. Some leading edge gouges were observed near the separated blade tip. Chordwise striations were observed throughout the span of the separated rotor blade. The rotor blade that remained attached to the hub exhibited chordwise striations throughout the blade span and was bent and buckled throughout. The tailrotor assembly was unremarkable. The tailrotor slider functioned normally by hand. The tailrotor driveshaft was intact and twisted at the forward attach point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was established throughout the helicopter for all primary flight controls. Separations in the control torque tubes were observed, and the areas of separation exhibited signatures consistent with overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward portion of the airframe was destroyed. The instrument panel was impact damaged with multiple instruments displaced. The forward portion of both landing skids were bent upward. Impact damage to the fuselage was found consistent with a main rotor blade strike.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left side engine mount remained intact. The right side engine mount was separated (consistent with a forward motion). All six drive belts were found separated into multiples pieces. The engine was removed from the gearbox. Damage was noted to the pulley and gearbox assembly. Rotational continuity was established throughout the gearbox assembly. Rotational continuity was also established throughout the turbine engine, however, was stiff. The exhaust, combustion housing, and nozzle were removed. Slight scoring rubbing was observed on the nozzle, found consistent with slight turbine wheel contact with the housing. Once the nozzle was removed, the turbine assembly rotated freely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the recovered airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any preexisting anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor further information, see the NTSB Recovered Airframe and Engine Examination Summary Report within the public docket for this accident. - Examination of the helicopter by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the helicopter came to rest on its left side in an open desert area. All major structural components of the helicopter were located at the accident site. The wreckage was recovered to a secure location for further examination. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot's family reported that the purpose of the flight was to look for shed elk antlers. When the helicopter did not return, a search was initiated. The wreckage was located the following day on the side of a gully in rough terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnsite wreckage documentation revealed that the main rotor blades did not show evidence of rotation at the time of ground contact, and the rotating components of the airframe exhibited little damage. The gascolator container was stained an orange/brown color at the bottom and along the sides. Fluid drained from the gascolator was colorless but murky and had a faint smell of gasoline. A water/alcohol-indicating paste test revealed water contamination in the sample. If the pilot had drained fuel from the helicopter's fuel tank or gascolator before the flight, he would most likely have discovered the contamination. Other than the contaminated fuel, postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot kept aviation fuel in a barrel on his property, and he would pump the fuel into 5-gallon plastic cans, which he used to fuel the helicopter. Testing of the fluid in some of the cans revealed significant water contamination. One of the cans contained a mixture of about 50 percent aviation fuel and 50 percent water, and another contained a mixture of about 85 percent aviation fuel and 15 percent water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lack of damage to the main rotor blades and the rotating components of the airframe indicate that it is likely that the engine experienced a loss of power due to water contamination of the fuel. In order to spot antlers, the pilot was likely maneuvering at a low altitude; therefore, he had little time to react to a loss of engine power or locate a suitable landing site in the rough terrain.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Friends of the pilot indicated that he kept a barrel of aviation fuel outside of a building on private property. He would pump fuel from the barrel into 5-gallon plastic cans, which he in turn used to fill the helicopter. Investigators syphoned a sample from the barrel, and observed a light blue fluid that smelled like aviation gasoline. Investigators went to the building housing the gas cans, and observed seven cans. Four cans had enough liquid to drain into bottles. Fluid from two of the cans was light blue, and smelled like aviation gasoline; dipping a water/alcohol indicating paste into the liquid did not change the color of the paste. About 85 percent of the liquid from one can was light blue, and smelled like aviation gasoline. The remaining 15 percent was dark and murky; a water/alcohol indicating paste dipped into the murky liquid changed color from pink to dark red, indicating water. About 50 percent of the liquid from the fourth can was light blue, and smelled like aviation gasoline. The remaining 50 percent was dark and murky; a water/alcohol indicating paste dipped into the murky liquid changed color from pink to dark red, indicating water. - The helicopter was a Robinson R22 Beta II, serial number 2603. A review of the helicopter's logbooks revealed that the helicopter had a total airframe time of 2,828.6 hours at the most recent 100-hour inspection on April 26, 2013.  The logbooks contained an entry for an annual inspection dated June 28, 2012, at a total airframe time of 2,440.8 hours. The hour meter read 2,889.6 hours at the wreckage examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was a Lycoming O-360-J2A, serial number L-34900-36A. Total time on the engine was 2,889.6, and time since major overhaul was 744.7 hours. - On April 6, 2014, about 1215 mountain daylight time, a Robinson R22 Beta II, N13HG, collided with terrain near Green River, Utah. The pilot was operating the helicopter under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91.  The commercial pilot and one passenger sustained fatal injuries. The helicopter sustained substantial damage during the accident sequence. The local personal flight departed from private property near Green River about 1115. Visual (VMC) meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe family reported that the intention of the flight was to look for shed elk antlers. They reported that the helicopter was overdue about 1800 on April 6, and the Utah Highway Patrol initiated a search. Using signals from a cell tower and an emergency locator transmitter (ELT), they discovered the wreckage about 1300 the following day. - A postmortem examination of the pilot was conducted by the Office of the Medical Examiner, Utah Department of Health. The cause of death was reported as the effect of multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological tests on specimens recovered from the pilot were performed by the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute Forensic Toxicology Research Team in Oklahoma City. Analysis revealed no findings for carbon monoxide or volatiles.  Testing for cyanide was not accomplished.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe report contained the following findings for tested drugs: ibuprophen detected in urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRefer to the toxicology report included in the public docket for specific test parameters and results. - A review of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airman records revealed that the 38-year-old pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land and helicopter.  The pilot held a certified flight instructor (CFI) certificate with a rating for rotorcraft-helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a second-class medical certificate issued on March 24, 2014, with no limitations or waivers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo personal flight records were located for the pilot.  The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) obtained the aeronautical experience listed in this report from a review of the FAA airmen medical records on file in the Airman and Medical Records Center located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The pilot reported on his medical application that he had a total time of 7,800 hours with 200 hours logged in the previous 6 months. - Global Positioning Satellite System (GPS)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airplane was equipped with a Garmin GPSMap 396 GPS receiver. The unit sustained impact damage, and was sent to the NTSB Office of Research and Engineering for data extraction. The extracted data revealed a flight on April 6th. The initial data point at 1140:05 was not at the known departure point. The recorded flight began in the mountainous area where the pilot and passenger were looking for elk sheds. The path meandered in the area, and ended at 1211:59, about 1.6 nm from the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollow Up Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators from the NTSB, Lycoming, and Robinson Helicopters examined the wreckage in a hangar at Hurricane, Utah, on May 13, 2014. A detailed report is part of the public docket for this accident. No preimpact anomalies with the airframe or engine other than water in the fuel system were discovered. - The NTSB IIC, an NTSB investigator, and investigators from the FAA, Robinson Helicopters, Inc., and Lycoming Engines examined the wreckage on site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on its right side about a quarter way up the south slope of an east-west gully with a dry creek bed in the bottom. The slope changed at the midpoint of the fuselage; it was 55 degrees downhill below the wreckage and 40 degrees uphill above it. The creek bed was 30 feet away, and the bottom of the bluff was about 75 feet away. The first identified point of contact (FIPC) was a ground scar that was on a 255-degree magnetic heading. The vertical and horizontal stabilizer assembly separated, and was in a tree at the eastern end of the ground scar. A rock face was at the western end of the ground scar, and exhibited a 3-foot-diameter area of white marks with white paint shards at its base. The orientation of the fuselage was 180 degrees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth tail rotor blades separated a few inches from the hub. One blade was in the bottom of the gully; its fracture surface was angular and jagged. The other blade was in the tree with the stabilizer assembly; its fracture surface was angular and jagged and there was a dent in the leading edge near the tip. The aft skid crosstube was in the bottom of the dry creek about 30 feet from the tail rotor blade.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blades were oriented north-south. The south blade did not exhibit any leading or trailing edge damage, but did have a puncture midspan and midchord that went through to the top of the blade. The north blade bent down about 2 feet from the hub; it did not exhibit any leading or trailing edge polishing or dents.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine did not show evidence of catastrophic failure. The exhaust exhibited ductile bending.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe bowl section of the carburetor separated, and was in the forward portion of the ground scar. Liquid was drained from the gascolator that was colorless, but murky, into two bottles. The fluid in one bottle had no smell; the other bottle had a faint smell of gasoline. A water/alcohol indicating paste was dipped into the liquid in both bottles; the paste changed color from pink to dark red, indicating water. The gascolator was removed; it contained an orange/brown colored fluid in the bottom and orange/brown colored stains along the sides. A water/alcohol indicating paste was dipped into the liquid; the paste changed color from pink to dark red, indicating water. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was repositioning the helicopter from a rooftop helipad where it had just been refueled to a nearby airport. Video footage revealed that the helicopter lifted off of the helipad and simultaneously started to yaw to the left, consistent with a loss of tail rotor control. The helicopter completed one 360-degree rotation about the yaw (vertical) axis in a near level attitude while climbing. As it continued to rotate (spin) to the left, the helicopter deviated from a level attitude, pitching nose down and banking right, consistent with a loss of main rotor control. The helicopter moved away from the helipad, lost altitude, and impacted the street below. A postcrash fire erupted that consumed most of the fuselage and the forward section of the tailboom. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll major structural components of the helicopter were found at the accident site, and there was no evidence of an inflight failure of the airframe. Examination of the engine revealed that it was producing power at the time of impact. Further, the main rotor and tail rotor systems exhibited damage consistent with powered impact. Flight control continuity could not be confirmed due to fire and impact damage, and most components of the hydraulic system were severely fire damaged or destroyed preventing determination of their preimpact condition.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB determined that the loss of tail rotor and main rotor control resulted from a loss of hydraulic boost. This determination was made based on a series of deductions. A helicopter can enter a left yaw at takeoff for one of three reasons: 1) a loss of tail rotor effectiveness, 2) a loss of tail rotor drive, or 3) a loss of tail rotor control. In this accident, a loss of tail rotor effectiveness was unlikely because the reported wind speeds at nearby airports at the time of the accident were 4 knots or less. A loss of tail rotor drive was ruled out in this case based on the physical evidence indicating that the tail rotor was powered at ground impact. Thus, the left yaw at takeoff was likely due to a loss of tail rotor control.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA loss of tail rotor control can result from one of three circumstances: 1) a disconnect in the tail rotor pedal control system; 2) a restriction or jam in the pedal controls, or 3) a loss of hydraulic boost to the pedal controls. Although either a disconnect or a restriction/jam in the pedal controls would explain the helicopter's left yaw at takeoff, neither would explain the rapid loss of pitch and bank (main rotor) control that occurred after the first 360-degree yaw rotation that appears consistent with a loss of hydraulic boost to the main rotor controls. Therefore, a loss of hydraulic boost to the pedal controls, followed by a loss of hydraulic boost to the main rotor controls, most likely occurred.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB then evaluated scenarios that may have led to the complete loss of hydraulic boost to the main and tail rotor controls during takeoff. These scenarios include the following, with the last being the most likely, as described below:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nScenario 1 – Loss of hydraulic pressure due to mechanical failure and simultaneous failure of the yaw load compensator. In this scenario, a loss of pressure to the hydraulic system would result in the loss of hydraulic boost to the main and tail rotor servo controls. The yaw load compensator would provide partial hydraulic boost to the pedal controls unless the compensator failed, which would result in no hydraulic boost to the pedal controls. Because the yaw load compensator would likely have been functionally checked during the preflight hydraulics check, this scenario is considered unlikely because of the low probability of two separate failures occurring simultaneously. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nScenario 2 – A misconfiguration of the hydraulic system at the conclusion of the preflight hydraulic system checks. In this scenario, the pilot would have performed the preflight hydraulic system checks but would have failed to reset the \"HYD TEST\" button, the hydraulic cut-off switch, or both, at the end of the preflight hydraulic system checks. The accumulator check, which requires the pilot to activate and then reset the \"HYD TEST\" button, is the first of the two preflight hydraulic system checks. Activating the \"HYD TEST\" button depressurizes the main and tail rotor servo controls, depletes the yaw load compensator, but does not deplete the main rotor accumulators. The hydraulic cut-off test, which activates and then resets the hydraulic cut-off switch, is the second of the two preflight hydraulic system checks. Activating the hydraulic cut-off switch depressurizes the main and tail rotor servo controls, depletes the main rotor accumulators, but does not depressurize the yaw load compensator. The preflight hydraulic system checks require the pilot to visually confirm that the \"HYD\" warning light turns off after completion of each check, and this light would have remained illuminated had either or both the \"HYD TEST\" button and hydraulic cut-off switch not been reset by the pilot. Unless the pilot was performing the preflight hydraulic checks via tactile feel of the controls alone, without visual confirmation of the \"HYD\" warning light on the caution-warning panel, and did not verify all caution and warning lights were extinguished before takeoff, as required by the flight manual, the scenario of a misconfigured hydraulic system at the conclusion of the preflight hydraulic checks is unlikely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nScenario 3 – Loss of pressure during the preflight hydraulic system accumulator check due to activation of the \"HYD TEST\" button combined with an unlocked collective stick. In this scenario, the pilot would have engaged the \"HYD TEST\" button and then moved the cyclic control stick to verify that the main rotor accumulators were functioning properly. If the collective stick was not locked during this check and one or more of the main rotor accumulators were depleted by the cyclic movements, the collective would have moved up rapidly. This uncommanded collective movement is caused by a design characteristic of the main rotor system in the AS350 helicopter. The uncommanded movement is prevented by engaging the collective lock as specified in the preflight checklist. Although accidents have occurred in which an unsecured collective stick moved up enough to cause an inadvertent liftoff (see NTSB accident investigations LAX01LA083 and LAX02TA299), postaccident ground testing with an exemplar helicopter showed that, at its estimated takeoff weight, the accident helicopter would not have become airborne or light on its skids due to uncommanded collective movement as a result of main rotor accumulator depletion alone. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRevision 3 of the AS350-B2 rotorcraft flight manual indicated that the preflight hydraulic system checks were to be conducted with the fuel flow control lever (FFCL) set between the \"OFF\" and \"FLIGHT\" detents. The pilot was trained in this procedure. During the ground tests, no heave (upward movement) was felt during the tests conducted with the FFCL set properly between the \"OFF\" and \"FLIGHT\" detents. However, the operator's checklist, which was likely used by the pilot, specified that the FFCL be set to the \"FLIGHT\" detent (a higher power setting) during the preflight hydraulic system checks. During the ground tests with the FFCL in the \"FLIGHT\" detent, when the collective moved up, a heave was felt by the occupants of the exemplar helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIf the pilot did not lock the collective and performed the accumulator check with the FFCL in the \"FLIGHT\" detent per the operator's checklist, he may have been startled by an uncommanded increase in collective and the accompanying heave. The pilot may have reacted by manually increasing collective pitch, resulting in an unplanned takeoff. Once airborne, the lack of hydraulic boost to the pedals would have resulted in an uncontrolled left yaw, and, as all three main rotor accumulators became depleted, the main rotor controls would have lost hydraulic boost, resulting in a rapid loss of control. This scenario best matches the video evidence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBecause scenarios 1 and 2 are considered unlikely, scenario 3 is left as the most likely scenario for this accident. However, because of the damage to the hydraulic system components and because the helicopter was not equipped with any type of flight recording device, no determination could be made regarding the pilot's actions during performance of the preflight hydraulic checks or regarding the hydraulic system configuration when the helicopter became airborne. If a recorder system that captured cockpit audio, images, and parametric data had been installed, it would likely have enabled reconstruction of the sequence of events leading to the loss of control.",
    "FactualNarrative": "***This report was modified on November 24, 2015, and September 6, 2016. Please the docket for this accident to view the original report.***&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 18, 2014, about 0738 Pacific daylight time (PDT), an Airbus Helicopters (formerly Eurocopter) AS 350 B2, N250FB, was destroyed when it impacted terrain following takeoff from the KOMO TV Heliport (WN16), Seattle, Washington. The helicopter was registered to, and operated by, Helicopters Incorporated, Cahokia, Illinois, under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The commercial pilot and one passenger were fatally injured, and one person, located in a stationary vehicle, was seriously injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed for the local repositioning flight, which was originating at the time of the accident. The pilot's intended destination was the Renton Municipal Airport (RNT), Renton, Washington.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Electronic News Gathering (ENG) equipped helicopter had landed on the KOMO News helipad about 30 minutes prior to the accident. The purpose was to refuel for its repositioning flight to RNT. A witness who was located on the south side of the helipad reported that he observed the helicopter initially lift off of the helipad to about 15 ft, followed by a muffled sound like a car backfiring. The witness opined that after lifting off it immediately pointed nose up, and began rotating counter-clockwise, after which it rotated out of sight. A second witness, who was stationed in a crane a few hundred feet to the northeast of the helipad, reported that he observed the helicopter lift up off of the helipad, turn toward the west, and then shot straight back with its nose up, and out of control. It then nosed down into the street below. The helicopter descended into an occupied automobile near a main street intersection, after which a postimpact fire ensured.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the investigation, a review of three security camera recordings, which were provided to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) by the Seattle Police Department, revealed that the helicopter initially landed on the helipad, and remained stationary for about 15 minutes. The helicopter lifted off and simultaneously began to rotate counter-clockwise in a near level attitude. The helicopter continued to rotate counter-clockwise for about 180 degrees while it ascended slightly above the elevated helipad, after which it began to ascend further while moving slightly away from the elevated helipad. After the helicopter completed about a 360-degree rotation, the helicopter transitioned to a nose-low (tail-high) attitude while it continued to rotate counter-clockwise. The helicopter rotated counter-clockwise another 180 degrees, and then began to lose altitude while moving rapidly away from the elevated helipad. The helicopter then descended until ground impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter came to rest on its right side, oriented on a magnetic heading of about 050 degrees. A vehicle located east of the main wreckage was fire damaged. Another vehicle, which was located immediately west of the main wreckage and oriented on a southerly heading, exhibited impact damage. All major structural components of the helicopter were located in the immediate area of the main wreckage. Wreckage debris was located within an approximate 340 foot radius to the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was recovered to a secured location for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot in Command&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGeneral&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 59, possessed a commercial pilot certificate with a helicopter instrument rating. He also held a helicopter flight instructor certificate with an instrument helicopter rating. His most recent second-class medical certificate was issued on February 6, 2014, with the limitation, \"Must wear corrective lenses and possess glasses for near and intermediate vision.\" The pilot successfully completed his most recent flight review in the accident helicopter on February 8, 2014.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the pilot's personal pilot logbooks revealed that as of February 7, 2014, he had accumulated a total flight time of 6,538.8 hours, all in rotorcraft-helicopters.  Additionally, the pilot had accumulated 6,295.5 hours as pilot-in-command, 2,841 hours of instruction given, 1,047 hours in the Airbus AS350-D, and about 5.5 hours in the Airbus AS350-B2 helicopter. Additionally, the pilot had logged 1,122 hours in the Bell 206 helicopter, and a total of 1,092 hours flight time in the Bell 407.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA family member revealed during an interview with NTSB investigators that the pilot worked part time as an ENG pilot on the early morning shift. He would normally awaken between 0300 and 0400, and report for work at 0500, normally Monday thru Friday, but sometimes on weekends if there was a need. He would normally return home from his full time job as an engineer for a local airplane manufacturing company, and predictably go to bed at 2000. The family member said that the pilot was in excellent health, had no sleep disorders, and had performed this schedule for many years. Additionally, the family member opined that the pilot was looking forward to flying full time after retiring from his full time job.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot's ENG Operational Experience&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA further review of the pilot's recorded personal logbook entries revealed that he had started ENG flight operations in a Bell 206 on May 30, 2002, accumulating a total of 1,090 hours in this make and model helicopter, prior to transitioning to the Airbus AS350-D model on August 16, 2004. The pilot then operated this make and model helicopter in ENG operations until July 9, 2008, having accumulated a total time of 1,047 hours in the AS350-D.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrior to concluding ENG flight operations in the AS350-D during July 2008, the pilot received Bell 407 transition training with Bell Helicopters on April 26, 2006. The pilot then flew the Bell 407 on a limited basis from August, 2006 to January 2008, accumulating a total of about 24 hours of flight time during this period. On January 21, 2008, the pilot attended Bell 407 recurrent training, having received 2.5 hours of flight training. The pilot subsequently began flying the Bell 407 helicopter in ENG flight operations on March 24, 2008, with his last flight logged in this make and model helicopter on February 7, 2014. At this time, the pilot had accumulated a total flight time of 1,092 hours in the Bell 407.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot's Airbus AS350 B2 Training&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Helicopters Incorporated personnel, the accident helicopter arrived at the company's Renton base of operations on January 30, 2014. The helicopter had been ferried from St. Louis, Missouri, to Renton by a part time company Check Airman, and the Renton based pilot who shared flying duties with the accident pilot; this pilot normally flew the afternoon shift, relieving the accident pilot about 1000.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to training records supplied to the NTSB IIC at the request of Helicopters Incorporated, the pilot began Airbus AS350-B2 training January 31, the day after the helicopter arrived at the Renton base. At this time the Check Airman gave the pilot 0.5 hours of recurrent training. Subsequently, on February 8, the accident pilot received an additional 3.0 hours of flight instruction, which was inclusive of a check ride. The pilot satisfactorily passed the check ride, as well as the Airbus AS350 limitations written test. The pilot next flew the accident helicopter on the day of the accident, March 18, which would have been 39 days after his most recent flight in the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirbus AS350 B2 Checklists Used During Training&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the postaccident examination of the helicopter, inclusive of the onsite and follow-up layout examinations, the helicopter's checklist was not observed. In several discussions with the Helicopters Incorporated Assistant Director of Operations and the company's Director of Safety, it was frequently stated that the Abbreviated Checklist for the AS350 BA/B2, Revision 1 (an internal document), dated June 30, 2009, which was a two-sided laminated checklist with a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Approved Date of August 20, 2009, and signed by an FAA inspector assigned to the St. Louis (STL) Missouri Flight Standards District Office, had been delivered with the helicopter when it arrived at the Renton base. Additionally, the Renton-based pilot (who had ferried the helicopter from St. Louis to Renton with the part-time company Check Airman, when interviewed by the NTSB IIC and asked which checklist would have been in the helicopter at the time of the accident), revealed that it was a two-sided, laminated checklist, and that it had an FAA approved stamp on it.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the most current revision to the AS350-B2 Rotorcraft Flight Manual (RFM) was Revision 4, dated the 11th week of year 2010. Revision 3, dated the 21st week of year 2006, contained changes to Paragraph 3 (\"Starting\") of Section 4.1 (\"Operating Procedures\") to set the fuel flow control lever (FFCL) to a position between the \"OFF\" and \"FLIGHT\" detents in order to achieve a gas generator speed (Ng) of between 67-70% before performing the hydraulic system checks. According to the airframe manufacturer, an Ng of 67-70% will result in a corresponding main rotor speed (Nr) of about 270 rotations per minute (RPM). According to the RFM, 100% Nr on the ground at low pitch is between 375-385 RPM. The previous procedure (Revision 2 and prior) was to set the FFCL to the \"FLIGHT\" detent, about 82% Ng, resulting in 100% Nr, prior to performing the hydraulic system checks. According to the airframe manufacturer, the change to the starting procedures in the RFM was a result of several events where the helicopter became unintentionally airborne due to the collective stick becoming unlocked during the hydraulic system checks. By performing the hydraulic system checks at 67-70% Ng, the helicopter should not become airborne if the collective stick was not locked, or becomes unlocked during the hydraulic system checks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the airframe manufacturer, six copies of Revision 3 to the RFM were mailed to the operator on May 12, 2010. However, there was no evidence that the previous edition of the checklist, the Abbreviated Checklist dated June 30, 2009, had been revised to reflect the lower Ng setting prior to conducting the hydraulic system checks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the part-time Check Airman, who provided the recurrent flight training for the accident pilot was asked during a meeting of parties to the investigation on May 22, 2014, which checklist he used during training, the Check Airman stated that he used the procedures that were outlined in Revision 3 of the RFM. Additionally, the Check Airman stated that he had instructed both the accident pilot and the second pilot who shared the local ENG duties with the accident pilot, to use the procedures outlined in Revision 3 of the RFM (Ng of 67-70%). In addition, an FAA inspector recalled that during the conference meeting, the Check Airman mentioned that the checklist used had the hydraulic checks being conducted with the engine throttle in the Flight Gate (Ng about 82%). Further, the Check Airman stated that after Revision 3 became active, he notified the operator's Chief Pilot of the change to the Ng setting prior to performing the hydraulic system checks; however, the checklist in use at the time was not revised. The operator opined that the Abbreviated Checklist was neither revised nor removed from their AS350 B2 fleet as a result of an oversight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the part time Check Airman, who provided the recurrent flight training for the accident pilot was asked several weeks after his initial statement to the investigative team on May 22, 2014, if he remembered if the Abbreviated Checklist was in the accident helicopter, either during the ferry flight to Renton from St. Louis, or during the training he conducted after he had arrived back to the Renton base following the ferry flight, he said that he could not recall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGeneral&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter, an Airbus Helicopters AS350-B2, serial number (S/N) 3669, was equipped with a Turbomeca Arriel 1D1 engine. A review of the maintenance records revealed that the helicopter had accumulated a total time of 7,706.5 hours at the time of the accident. Additionally, the engine, S/N 9849, had accumulated 7,122.9 hours since new, and 538 hours since it last overhaul.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMaintenance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the helicopter was maintained in accordance with the Manufacturer's Inspection Program. On March 13, 2014, at an aircraft total time (ATT) of 7,698.5 hours, the most recent inspection was performed and documented per a Maintenance Log Entry. The inspection revealed the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n•\ta 30-hour check of the tail rotor blades in accordance with (IAW) Chapter 64-10 of the Eurocopter Airworthiness Limitations Section, Rev. 004,    dated June 6, 2013, with no defects noted.&#x0D;\n•\tComplied with Eurocopter Alert Service Bulletin 05.00.60, Rev. 0, tail rotor pitch change links check, with no defects noted.&#x0D;\n•\tComplied with Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2011-22-05, inspection of tail rotor pitch change links, with no defects noted.&#x0D;\n•\tPerformed 30-hour engine inspection IAW Turbomeca Arriel 1D1 Maintenance Manual, update #17, dated October 30, 2013, with no defects noted.&#x0D;\n•\tComplied with AD 2003-02-05, Sliding Door Rail Inspection, with no defects noted.&#x0D;\n•\tComplied with Eurocopter Alert Service Bulletin 05.00.74 Rev. 1, Tail Rotor Pitch Horn Inspection, with no defects noted.&#x0D;\n•\tComplied with 100-hour inspection items that have no margin in the Eurocopter Airworthiness Limitations Section 04-20-00, Rev. 4 dated June 6, 2013, with no defects noted. This was accomplished in order to extend the 100-hour inspection by using the 10-hour tolerance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 5, 2014, at an ATT of 7,676.1 hours, the operator complied with FAA Airworthiness Directive (AD) No. 2014-02-05, a recurrent inspection of the clearance between the main rotor collective control lever and the collective locking stud. The AD specifically defined an unsafe condition as the main rotor collective pitch lever (collective) locking stud inadvertently locking in the low pitch position, which could result in a subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. (Refer to the AD, which is appended to the docket for this report.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 29, 2012, at an ATT of 6,548.0 flight hours and a component total time (CTT) of 6,007.0 hours, a tail rotor servo control, S/N 1298, was installed on the accident helicopter. The tail rotor servo control was overhauled on February 21, 2012 by UTAS in Vernon, France.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator of the helicopter, Helicopters Incorporated, was founded in 1978 by a private individual. As of August 14, 2014, it was reported that the company operated more than 70 ENG helicopters in 36 markets nationwide. In calendar year 2013, the company flew over 35,000 hours in support of ENG operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company's organization consists of the following:&#x0D;\n•\tDirector of Operations&#x0D;\n•\tAssistance Director of Operations&#x0D;\n•\tChief Pilot&#x0D;\n•\tDirector of Maintenance&#x0D;\n•\tDirector of Safety&#x0D;\n•\tADPM &amp; Security Coordinator&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company's employment base consisted of the following:&#x0D;\n•\tPilots – 149&#x0D;\n•\tMaintenance support personnel – 49&#x0D;\n•\tTotal employees – 285&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company's complement of aircraft/helicopters includes the following:&#x0D;\n•\tBell 206B – 24&#x0D;\n•\tBell 206L3 – 2&#x0D;\n•\tBell 206L4 – 26&#x0D;\n•\tBell 407 – 11&#x0D;\n•\tAirbus AS350BA – 3&#x0D;\n•\tAirbus AS350B2 – 6&#x0D;\n•\tAirbus AS350B3 – 1&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTotal number of aircraft – 73&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAERODROME INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWN16 was activated on May 1982. The address of the heliport was 100 4th Avenue North, Seattle, Washington, and was located at coordinates 47 degrees, 37.30 minutes north latitude and 122 degrees, 20.68 minutes west longitude. The estimated elevation above mean sea level (msl) was reported as 363 feet. The height above the street level where the helicopter came to rest was about 85 ft. The operational surface area of the heliport, constructed of concrete, was about 65 feet in diameter. The heliport incorporated edge lighting around its perimeter. It also incorporated sunrise to sunset (SS-SR) lighting, which was pilot controlled. The operator reported that the company has no outlined departure or arrival procedures for the heliport.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) DATA&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a Garmin GPSMAP 496 battery-powered portable 12-channel GPS receiver. The device included a built-in Jeppesen database, and was capable of receiving XM satellite radio for flight information. The device stored date, route-of-flight, and flight-time information for up to 50 flights. A flight record was triggered when groundspeed exceeded 30 knots and GPS altitude exceeded 250 feet. The log ended when groundspeed dropped below 30 knots for 10 minutes or more. A detailed tracklog, including latitude, longitude, date, time, and GPS altitude information, was stored within the device.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA NTSB Vehicle Recorder Specialist reported the device had sustained impact damage to the screen, housing, and soft-key controls. A surrogate screen was used, and power was applied to the accident device. Recorded waypoint, route, and tracklog data was successfully downloaded from the device via the universal serial bus (USB) port. The data extracted included 44 sessions from March 1, 2014, through March 18, 2014, and consisted of 10,001 total data points. The accident event was identified from the recorded date and time starting at 14:35:46 coordinated universal time (UTC) and ending at 14:39:49 UTC on March 18, 2014, consisting of 6 data points.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecovered data revealed that the helicopter was at rest on the helipad at 14:39:10 UTC. At 14:39:43 UTC, the helicopter began to move and depart to the right. The final groundspeed and altitude were 12 knots, and 203 ft, respectively. Additionally, data revealed that the flight prior to the accident flight departed from the RNT at 12:35:33 UTC; however, the recording ended just after departing the airport at 12:41:33 UTC. For more information about the GPS receiver, see the NTSB Specialist's Factual Report in the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWEIGHT AND BALANCE&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that the helicopter's maximum gross weight was 4,960 pounds. The operator further reported that at the time of takeoff the helicopter's weight would have been 4,752 pounds. The computed data also revealed that the helicopter was within the center-of-gravity limits.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFUELING&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the helicopter would have departed the WN16 with full fuel (about 143 gallons) at the time of departure. Reportedly, the pilot had just landed, and added 75 gallons. The operator reported that normal procedures were for the pilot to have \"topped off\" the helicopter prior to departure back to their facility at RNT.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0751 PDT, the automated weather reporting facility at Boeing Field (BFI), which was located about 5 nautical miles (nm) south-southeast of the accident site, reported wind 120 degrees at 4 knots (kts), 6 miles visibility, haze, broken clouds at 1,500 feet, broken clouds at 2,100 feet, overcast clouds at 3,100 feet, temperature 6 degrees C, dew point 3 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.00 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0753 PDT, the automated weather reporting facility at RNT, located about 9 nm southeast of the accident site, reported wind calm, visibility 10 miles, overcast clouds at 4,100 ft, temperature 4 degrees C, dew point 2 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.33 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0737 PDT, the automated weather reporting facility at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA), located 9 nm south of the accident site, reported wind 130 degrees at 4 kts, visibility 10 miles, broken clouds at 2,800 feet, overcast clouds at 3,700 feet, temperature 4 degrees C, dew point 1 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.32 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0730 PDT, the automated weather reporting facility at the Snohomish County Airport, also known as Paine Field (PAE), located about 17 nm north of the accident site, reported wind variable at 3 kts, visibility 10 miles, overcast clouds at 1,500 feet, temperature 4 degrees C, dew point 1 degree C, and an altimeter setting of 30.31 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the morning of the accident, the NTSB IIC, assisted by the Deputy Regional Chief of the NTSB's Western Pacific Regional Office, and two NTSB Aviation Accident Investigators, as well as two Aviation Safety Inspectors from the FAA, performed an onsite investigation of the helicopter wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage and associated debris was located on a street curb and sidewalk, and in a grassy area just north of the street, about 200 feet distant. The majority of the helicopter's structure was burned or totally consumed by a post-impact fire. The helicopter was observed to have passed through the outer branches of two trees prior to making impact with a parked car. The energy path was generally oriented on a northerly heading, with the tail boom and aft section, half lying out of the fire burn area, on a magnetic heading of about 050 degrees. The angular flight path, when measured from the center of the main wreckage to the first tree strike and the top of the helipad was measured at 30 degrees. The components observed at this location included the helicopter's skids, cabin area, engine, transmission, and rotor blades. All of the dynamic and static components of the helicopter were accounted for at the accident site. The two trees in the immediate area of the accident site exhibited branch strikes from the fuselage, and/or main rotor blades (MRB). Vegetation and the street pavement in the area about 50 feet surrounding the helicopter's at rest location sustained post-impact thermal consumption.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth landing gear skid tubes were observed to have been broken in multiple locations. The forward and aft cross tubes full lengths were separated from the skids and step. The tail stinger skid exhibited forward skid scratches more pronounced on the right side than the left side.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll three main rotor blades exhibited signatures of powered impact strikes throughout the length of the blades, primarily exhibiting fraying to the outboard 4 to 5 feet, with thermal decomposition to the rest of the blades up to the roots of the rotor hub. The red MRB was observed cut at the sleeve by the salvage recovery team. One of the blade tip balance weights was found 300 feet north of the main wreckage, and one MRB metal tip was found lodged in the driver's side door of a gray pickup truck, which was second in line at the stop light.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward section of the tailboom was consumed by postimpact fire damage. The right horizontal stabilizers exhibited impact bending damage and scratches from the outboard to inboard, and down and aft. The vertical stabilizer, ventral, and dorsal fin were impact damaged, with signatures similar to that of pavement scraping on the right side.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine output tail rotor drive shaft flange remained bolted to the engine. However, all three flange tangs that attach to the flex couplings were bent and pulled aft and separated at the flex coupling, with torsional splaying  observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine side of the short shaft exhibited the remainder of the flex coupling. Torsional splaying was also observed, with flange tangs bent forward in the direction of the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tangs were observed to have broken off at the aft side of the short shaft. The splined coupling remained attached to the flex coupling.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward splined end of the main tail rotor drive shaft was thermally separated from the remainder of the main tail rotor drive shaft at the forward most hangar support bearing. Two diagonal impact indentations were observed on the shaft between the 3rd and 4th hangar support bearings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor drive shaft fairing also exhibited various impact signatures from the right side through the fairing, in the same location as the indentations on the drive shaft. The coupling at the aft end of the drive shaft to the tail rotor gear box (TRGB) was partially connected, but separated at the tangs on both sides of the flex coupling under tension. The TRGB exhibited impact damage, and was partially attached to the monocoque structure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe oil cap was not observed. The filler neck exhibited impact scratches; some straw yellow/brown colored oil was observed leaking from the unit. Continuity was confirmed through the tail rotor gear box. The tail rotor blades rotated freely when the drive shaft input was rotated by hand; the rotor shaft was bent slightly. No particles were observed on the chip detector, which was found loose and out of its socket. One of the pitch change links was bent and damaged, with scratches and yellow paint observed (similar to that found on the street curb). The hub was not removed from the rotor shaft; the \"woodruff key\" was not examined at this time. The yaw load compensator was found broken, thermally damaged, and separated from the helicopter. It was subsequently located in the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne of the tail rotor blade (paddles) exhibited leading edge impact, which destroyed the blade from the blade tip to about 18 inches from the root. The leading edge exhibited a yellow paint transfer on the surface, and had a rough concrete type dimpling similar to that of the street pavement. The accompanying  blade was observed more intact, and exhibited a shape closer to its original design; however, it was significantly damaged from impact forces. Both blades were observed broken at the hub, but remained attached to the tail rotor system at the root through the hub. The tail rotor blades were retained for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity could not be confirmed due to fire and impact damage. Only the right side pilot's controls were installed. The anti-torque pedals, cyclic, and collective controls were observed lying loose in the area of the cockpit wreckage debris; they were thermally damaged and separated from the remainder of the push/pull, or hydraulic control system. The right anti-torque pedal 'foot arm' was bent up slightly. The hydraulic switch on the collective control was thermally destroyed. Flight control continuity was only observed aft of the tail rotor push pull shaft to the TRGB. The flex-ball cable system exhibited heavy thermal and impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instruments, the caution-warning annunciator panel, and the 30 Alpha switch button panel were heavily damaged from the impact forces and post-impact fire. Switch positions and instrument readings or condition of the instruments were not available or reliable for readout. The rotor brake, fuel flow control lever, and fuel shutoff quadrant were completely separated from the helicopter, and heavily damaged from the postimpact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's fuel system was consumed by fire. The fuel boost pumps were observed loose in the wreckage, with impact and thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe transmission was separated from the airframe, and found lying on its right side. It was observed relatively intact and remained attached to the rotor head (mast and hub), which included the Starflex, and the red, blue, and yellow main rotor blades, with their sleeves and spherical thrust bearings attached. Also observed were the three main rotor servos, three pitch change links, and the top half of the control rods. The bottom half of the control rods were consumed by the fire. Two of the Starflex arms were broken with a 45-degree break across their arms; one was observed broken at approximately 90 degrees across the arm. The hydraulic system's tank, pump, and associated lines were consumed by the post-impact fire. The remaining hydraulic system components, including all three MR servos, yaw load compensator/servo, and manifold were removed from the rotor system, and retained by the NTSB for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub vibration absorber and weight was separated from the top of the rotor head mast in sheer at its attachment bolts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was partially separated from the airframe, and found lying within the area of the main wreckage. The main rotor drive shaft to the transmission was torsionally broken, and separated approximately three-fourths of the way from the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll of the observed damage, failures, and deformations during the wreckage examination were determined to be a result of the impact forces and post-impact fire. No pre-impact anomalies were noted with the helicopter during the investigation that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 19, 2014, an autopsy on the pilot was performed at the facility of the King County Medical Examiner's Office, Seattle, Washington. The examination revealed that the cause of death was the result of blunt force injury and thermal charring.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology testing on the pilot. The test was negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and tested drugs. Testing for cyanide was not performed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 19th and 20th,  2014, under the supervision of the NTSB IIC, a TurbomecaUSA Accident and Investigation Safety technician performed a field examination of the Turbomeca Arriel 1D1 engine, serial number 9849. The technician reported the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine as found was still partially connected to the transmission via the liaison tube and gimble. The rear engine mount had been broken away from the engine deck. The engine exhibited external thermal damage from the postcrash fire, as well as impact damage mainly in the area of the exhaust pipe and linking tube.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll fuel, oil, and air pipes were found properly connected and safetied.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe gas generator (module 3) could be rotated by hand. The axial compressor blades showed signs of FOD damage on the leading edges, and one blade was curled forward at the leading edge tip.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe reduction gearbox (module 5) was removed to examine the input pinion slippage mark. The mark was found slipped ˜ 2mm in the tightening direction consistent with the engine providing power at time of a main rotor strike.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nContinuity was confirmed through the reduction gear box and could be turned by hand. After removal of the reduction gearbox, the free turbine could be turned freely by hand, however the power shaft still could not be turned.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine front support exhibited impact damage. It was removed, revealing the freewheel shaft / power shaft mating flanges. After the front support was removed, the power shaft / freewheel shaft could be turned freely by hand, and proper freewheel operation was confirmed. Continuity was confirmed through the accessory gearbox (module 1).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was subsequently shipped to the Turbomeca-USA facility in Grand Prairie, Texas, for a detailed examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 21, 2014, under the supervision of the NTSB IIC, a detailed examination of the engine was performed by the Turbomeca-USA Accident and Investigation Safety technician, at the Turbomeca-USA facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. The technician reported the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to the condition of the engine upon arrival, a test cell run could not be performed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe initial external examination of the engine revealed extensive impact and thermal damage. Subsequent to the removal of all external accessories, the free turbine (Module 4) was removed and examined. The turbine could be freely rotated by hand. Aluminum splatter could be observed on the leading edge of the turbine blades near the root.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accessory gearbox (Module 1) was removed from the gas generator. The FCU (fuel control unit) was removed, and continuity through both the N1 and N2 gear train was confirmed. No further disassembly of the module was performed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe axial compressor (Module 2) was removed from the gas generator (Module 3). The compressor wheel could be turned freely by hand. The axial compressor blades showed numerous signs of FOD damage consistent with the engine continuing to run during and after the accident sequence. No further disassembly of the module was deemed necessary.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe gas generator (Module 3) was completely disassembled and examined. Aluminum splatter was observed on the nozzle guide vanes and turbine blades of both the 1st and 2nd stages. This aluminum splatter was most likely the result of displacement of the air intake bell mouth during the accident sequence into the axial compressor, which was then partially ingested, subsequently melted by the combustion section, and deposited on the stationary and rotating parts in the gas path aft of the combustor. No other noteworthy observations were made in the gas generator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll indications from both the on-site investigation and the engine teardown examination are that the engine was producing torque prior to and during impact, which was evident by the displacement of the input pinion alignment marks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo evidence could be found of mechanical anomalies with the engine that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nComputed Tomography (CT) Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe retained hydraulic system components were examined using CT scans. The scans revealed the piston liner for the left roll servo control was deformed inward immediately below the piston head, and the yaw load compensator accumulator exhibited signatures of pitting on its internal wall. The scans also revealed evidence consistent with pitting on the inner wall of the yaw load compensator accumulator. Furthermore, the scans revealed the hydraulic pump bearing and pump gears did not exhibit evidence of smearing. The pump's splined shaft was engaged with no evidence of spline tooth shearing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor additional information on the findings from the CT scans, see the Computed Tomography and Aircraft Systems Specialist's Factual Report in the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHydraulic System Component Examinations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe retained hydraulic system components were shipped to the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) for disassembly and further examination.  On June 23-24, 2014, members of the Airworthiness Group convened at the United Technologies Corporation Aerospace Systems (UTAS), formerly Goodrich Actuation Systems, facilities in Vernon, France, for disassembly and examination of the hydraulic distribution block and the left roll, right roll, fore-aft, and tail rotor servo controls. On June 25-26, 2014, members of the Airworthiness Group convened at Airbus Helicopters facilities in Marignane, France, for disassembly and examination of the yaw load compensator, hydraulic pump, and the accumulator assemblies from the servo controls.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLeft Roll Servo Control (S/N 913)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe piston rod extension of the left roll servo control was measured to be about 3.85 inches, and visually did not exhibit bending deformation. The rod end threads exhibited no evidence of thread wear, but did exhibit small nicks consistent with impact damage. The piston rod was removed from the servo control and the piston liner was removed and confirmed to have deformation damage. A tan-colored liquid remnant was observed within the piston housing; the piston housing contained a brown-colored residue on its interior surface. A green- locking pin was visually confirmed to be in the locked position. The locking pin contained small, reddish-tan colored globules. The servo control filter screen contained a wet, black colored residue on its surface. The sliding valve was removed, and colored residue was observed on the central area of the piston surface. The control input exhibited no evidence of gouges, but the surfaces exposed to the hydraulic ports exhibited a residue similar to that found on the filter. The sliding valve sleeve had a clean appearance with no evidence of damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe solenoid piston assembly did not exhibit evidence of heat distress, but was sooted on its outer surfaces. Its outer and inner springs were present. The outer spring was measured to be about 0.73 inches in length. An oily, tan-colored residue was observed within the solenoid piston housing. No evidence of blockages was found in the solenoid piston hydraulic port. The valve for the accumulator did not move when pressed. The accumulator was sectioned and the inside contained charred bladder remnants and soot against the accumulator walls. The inner walls of the yaw load compensator accumulator exhibited evidence of surface oxidation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRight Roll Servo Control (S/N 1381)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe piston rod extension of the right roll servo control was measured to be about 4.21 inches, and visually did not exhibit bending deformation. The piston upper housing rotated about 0.08 inches. Examination of the contact surfaces between the conical lower attachment (the tri-lobe piece) and the piston upper housing exhibited no evidence of fretting or galling. On the piston head, the plastic scraper seal exhibited evidence of melting due to heat exposure.  The piston liner remained intact. The filter screen contained a black, soot-like residue but was otherwise clean. The control input locking pin was visually confirmed to be in the locked position. The locking pin contained small, reddish-tan colored globules. The sliding valve was removed and exhibited no evidence of gouges, but the surfaces exposed to the hydraulic ports exhibited a soot-like residue. The sliding valve sleeve was removed and exhibited damage to the outer diameter of the sleeve, but there was no evidence of damage on the sliding valve contact surfaces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe solenoid assembly exhibited evidence of heat exposure. Residue was observed on the return port of the solenoid valve. The solenoid piston assembly exhibited discoloration of its lower end consistent with heat exposure. Both its outer and inner springs were present. The outer spring was measured to be about 0.59 inches in length. No evidence of blockages was found in the solenoid piston hydraulic port.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe valve for the accumulator did not move when pressed. The accumulator was sectioned and the inside contained charred bladder remnants and soot against the accumulator walls.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFore-Aft Servo Control (S/N 172)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe valve for the accumulator did not move when pressed. The accumulator was sectioned and the inside contained charred bladder remnants and soot against the accumulator walls. The piston rod extension of the fore-aft servo control was not measured. The piston rod was bent about 4.05 inches from the lower end of the rod. The piston rod surfaces within the servo had a clean appearance. The piston liner had a slight bulge about 2.56 inches from its lower end. The control input locking pin was visually confirmed to be in the locked position. No debris was observed on the locking pin and spring. The filter screen contained a black, soot-like residue but was otherwise clean. The sliding valve was removed, and its surfaces exposed to the hydraulic ports exhibited a soot-like residue, but exhibited no evidence of gouges. The inner diameter of the sliding valve sleeve exhibited no evidence of damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe solenoid assembly exhibited evidence of heat exposure. The solenoid piston housing exhibited a tan-color stained appearance. Both its outer and inner springs were present. The outer spring was measured to be about 0.67 inches in length. No evidence of blockages was found in the solenoid piston hydraulic port.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTail Rotor Servo Control (S/N 1298)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe piston rod extension of the tail rotor servo control was measured to be 7.28 inches. The piston rod and piston liner exhibited evidence of heat distress. A dark-colored band was observed on the piston liner about 3.70 inches from the aft end of the piston liner; the dark-colored band was relatively the same width as the piston head. The locking pin was visually confirmed to be in the locked position. The locking pin, spring, and filter screen exhibited evidence of heat distress. The sliding valve exhibited no evidence of gouges, but exhibited sooting and oxidation products on the surfaces exposed to the hydraulic ports. The sliding valve sleeve was damaged during removal from the servo control.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nYaw Load Compensator&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe yaw load compensator exhibited signatures of heat distress. The inner surfaces of the output piston and piston bore, both of which contacts hydraulic fluid, exhibited surface oxidation. The output piston scraper seals were present, but only partially continuous on their circumference. The solenoid was disassembled, and its electrical connections appeared secured. The solenoid piston exhibited no evidence of cracks, but did exhibit signatures of heat distress primarily on its lower surface contacting the hydraulic port. The solenoid piston's outer and inner springs were present, with the outer spring exhibiting heat distress. The outer spring was measured to be about 0.55 inches in length. No evidence of blockages were found in the solenoid piston hydraulic port.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe valve for the accumulator did not move when pressed. The accumulator was sectioned, and the inside contained charred bladder remnants and soot against the accumulator walls. The inner walls of the yaw load compensator accumulator exhibited evidence of surface oxidation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHydraulic Distribution Block&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe clogging indicator in the hydraulic distribution block was observed popped out, with the button exhibiting heat distress. The pressure regulator cap was observed to be hand tight, with the regulator cap and spring exhibiting heat distress. The filter cap was jammed; a hand saw was used to cut off the filter cap to access the filter. The filter was removed, and appeared to have a soot-like residue, but was otherwise clean of debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHydraulic Pump&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic pump exhibited signatures of heat distress. The hydraulic pump strainer was sooted, and metallic particles were observed on the side of the strainer that was exposed to a fractured hydraulic port. The chip detector was sooted, and the chip detector remained magnetized. Debris found within the chip detector was not magnetic. The pump gear teeth exhibited no evidence of abnormal wear or fractured gear teeth. The male and female splines for the pulley exhibited signatures of heat distress, but did not exhibit evidence of abnormal spline wear or fractured splines. The pulley, shaft, and gears could not be manually rotated. (Refer to the Airworthiness Group Chairman's Factual Report, which is included in the docket for this report.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nServo Control Residue&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe reddish-tan color globules found on the locking pin spring of the left roll and right roll servo controls were analyzed by an NTSB Materials Laboratory chemist in Washington, D.C. A sample of globules taken from the left servo control was sent to an independent, third-party laboratory for analysis, which found the presence of four aluminum hydroxides and magnesium hydroxide, consistent with corrosion products. (For additional details, see the NTSB Materials Laboratory Factual Report No. 15-012, which is located in the docket for this investigation.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCollective Locking Device&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe collective locking plate is mounted to the central console in the cockpit. The pilot can lower the collective stick, and insert the locking stud on the forward end of the collective stick into the circular cut-out in the locking plate to lock the collective stick. This action is intended to prevent inadvertent collective stick manipulation during the starting checks (for additional information, see the Hydraulic System Checks section of this report). The locking plate is spring-loaded forward, which requires the pilot to physically move the plate aft in order to lock the collective. To disengage, the pilot would have to add a downward force on the collective stick in order to release it from the locking plate. The spring-loaded feature, in addition to a recurrent inspection to ensure proper clearance between the locking stud and the locking plate, is intended to prevent an inadvertent locking of the collective when the collective is bottomed out (moved to the full down position) during flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHydraulic System Checks&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe RFM requires hydraulic system checks during the starting procedures (pretakeoff). The hydraulic system checks consists of two separate checks performed in the following order: 1) the hydraulic accumulator check (HYD TEST) and 2) the hydraulic isolation check. The HYD TEST verifies the proper operation of the main rotor accumulators. According to the airframe manufacturer, main rotor control forces will increase above a certain airspeed. In the event of a hydraulic system failure that results in a drop in hydraulic system pressure, the main rotor accumulators provide limited hydraulic assistance to allow for the pilot to reduce airspeed to a point where the main rotor control forces are reduced to an acceptable level for manual control with no hydraulic assistance. The hydraulic isolation check is to verify the proper operation of the main and tail rotor servo control solenoids which serves to depressurize the servo controls in the event of a seizure of a servo control distributor. According to the airframe manufacturer, the collective lever must be locked during both hydraulics checks, as the depressurization of the main rotor servo controls and the depletion of the main rotor accumulator's results in an uncommanded increase in collective pitch, and could result in the helicopter becoming inadvertently airborne.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic accumulator check consists of depressing the \"HYD TEST\" button on the center console, which depressurizes the main and tail rotor servo controls as well as the yaw load compensator. This action results in no hydraulic assistance to the pedals. However, the main rotor accumulators provide backup hydraulic assistance to the cyclic and collective until they become depleted through movement of the cyclic (and/or collective) stick. To avoid reaching the complete depletion of the accumulators, the checklist requires only 2 to 3 movements in the 10 percent range of each axis. Once the check is complete, \"HYD TEST\" button is depressed again to return the button to its original position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic isolation check consists of setting the hydraulic cut-off switch, mounted on the collective stick, to the \"off\" position. This action results in the depressurization of the main and tail rotor servo controls as well as the main rotor accumulators, resulting in no hydraulic assistance to the cyclic and collective controls. However, the yaw load compensator remained pressurized and will continue to provide limited hydraulic assistance to the pedals. Once the check is complete, the hydraulic cut-off switch is returned to its original (\"on\") position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nActivation of one or both switches during the above referenced checks would result in the illumination of the HYD light on the caution warning panel. Additionally, should Nr be below 360 rpm or the hydraulic pressure less than 30 bars, an aural warning horn will sound continuously; the aural warning can be silenced by activating the HORN button on the center console annunciator panel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccidents and Incidents Related to the Hydraulic System Checks&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe manufacturer stated that between 2000 and 2006, there were five known events which involved the inadvertent unlocking or the pilot's failure to ensure that the collective stick control was properly locked prior to performing the pretakeoff hydraulic checks, which resulted in an inadvertent lift off during the hydraulic system checks. These known events included two that resulted in NTSB investigations (NTSB LAX01LA083 and LAX02TA299). Investigations into these previous events revealed that when the main rotor accumulators were depleted during the hydraulic HYD TEST, the unsecured collective stick raised enough to cause the helicopter to inadvertently lift off. Three events described the helicopter as spinning counterclockwise simultaneous to the lift off. Because the pilots of these events did not have hydraulic assistance to the main and tail rotor controls, the pilots could not regain control of the helicopter, and subsequently the helicopter impacted terrain. All of the known events occurred on the ground and the helicopter did not reach a high altitude prior to descent and ground impact. There were no fatal injuries associated with the five known events.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to the accidents and incidents related to the hydraulic system checks, the airframe manufacturer took several actions in an effort to mitigate the risk of becoming unintentionally airborne during the hydraulic system checks. The RFM was modified via Revision 3 to reduce Ng from 82% (FFCL in the flight detent) to 67-70% prior to performing the hydraulic systems checks, which resulted in a lower Nr at the time the hydraulic system checks are performed; reduced Nr would lower the lift that would be produced by the main rotor in the event the collective locking device became unlocked, mitigating the risk of an inadvertent take off. Additionally, an improved collective locking stud was introduced via Service Bulletin No. 67.00.37 (originally released on September 27, 2007) in an effort to mitigate the risk of the locking stud disengaging from the locking plate. The improved collective locking stud incorporated a steel stud with a different shape that also resulted in a higher wear resistance, as excessive wear of the original design collective locking stud was found to be a factor in at least one prior event.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the operator's maintenance records revealed that on July 16, 2008, the following entry was made: \"Complied with S.B. 67.00.37 R1, pilot's collective lever lock replacement (Mod 073237). Installed Lock (P/N 350A27-3155-22).\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSimulator Scenarios&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 22, 2014, several AS350-B2 Hydraulic/Tail Rotor related scenarios were conducted at the Airbus Helicopter's simulator facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. In attendance were members of the FAA, NTSB, BEA, Turbomeca, Helicopters, Inc., and Airbus Helicopters. The purpose of the seven operational scenarios was to attempt to understand what might have precipitated the lift off and counter-clockwise spin that was observed from the security videos.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe simulator used for the demonstrations was a full-motion, Indra AS350 Simulator, certified to FAA Level B standards. Prior to the demonstrations, the investigative team discussed the limitations of the simulator for the purpose of the demonstrations. In summary, the simulator is modeled to a specific level of fidelity based on a specific helicopter within a given flight regime. While the simulator generally reacts the way one would expect when a specific condition or situation is induced, the simulator will not necessarily represent the actual helicopter reaction and performance with that specified level of fidelity when the situation falls outside the flight regime, or conditions to which the simulator is modeled.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the results of the simulator scenarios revealed the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWith the collective stick not locked down or if it had become unlocked during the pretakeoff Hydraulic Isolation test or Hydraulic Accumulator (HYD) test with the FFCL in either the Ground Idle or Flight Idle positions, the collective pitch control rose rapidly to a point above the full down and locked position. In both instances the helicopter was not observed to have lifted off of the ground. Additionally, relative torque value could not be accurately determined based on the limitations of the simulator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWith respect to a mechanical failure of the tail rotor servo prior to departure due to a slide valve failure, it was the consensus of the group that yaw control can be achieved in this scenario when the emergency procedure is properly applied. Additionally, if a loss of tail rotor control was due to control linkage failure/jammed tail rotor control device (stuck anti-torque pedal), the results of the loss of tail rotor control were varied, and were dependent upon when the failure was initiated, and the reaction time of the pilot. Therefore, no definitive information was available relative to this scenario.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOther hydraulic or flight control related failures, which might prevent the pilot from correcting for the uncommanded left turn/spin were examined in the simulator. As a result, the consensus of the group was that control forces required to maintain control of the AS350 B2 helicopter are manageable in the absence of hydraulic pressure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor a detailed review of the of the simulator scenarios that were considered during the investigation, refer to the Airbus Helicopters Simulator Summary report in the docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel Examination/Testing&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel samples were obtained on the day of the accident from the heliport's fuel facility. The samples were subsequently fuel tested by an independent, third-party laboratory, with a copy of the test report submitted to the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, D.C., for review by an NTSB chemist. Upon review, the chemist reported that all results were within acceptable specification ranges.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGround Testing Using Exemplar Helicopter&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 15, 2016, ground tests were conducted using an exemplar AS350-B2 helicopter configured to the estimated weight and balance of the accident helicopter. The purpose of the ground testing was twofold: 1) to demonstrate the helicopter's reaction to an unlocked collective stick when performing the preflight hydraulics checks at varying rotor speeds and 2) to determine how those helicopter responses translated to effects felt by the pilot. During all tests performed, when the collective stick moved up upon depletion of the main rotor servo control accumulators, the helicopter did not become airborne or get light on its skids. During the tests performed with the FFCL set at 67-70% Ng, no anomalous vibrations, heaves, or bumps were noted by those within the helicopter when the collective stick moved up upon depletion of the main rotor servo control accumulators. During the tests performed with the FFCL in the \"FLIGHT\" detent, a noticeable heave (upward movement) was felt by those within the helicopter when the collective stick moved up upon depletion of the main rotor servo control accumulators. For a detailed description of the ground testing, refer to Addendum 1 to the Airworthiness Group Chairman's Factual Report, which is included in the docket for this accident.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Eurocopter Service Letter No. 1673-67-04, dated April 2, 2005, \"Main rotor rotating clockwise: Reminder concerning the YAW axis control for all helicopters in some flight conditions,\" various events were documented during flight near the ground and at very low speed in light wind conditions on aircraft fitted either with conventional tail rotors or with Fenestrons. (Refer to the above referenced Service Letter, which is appended to the docket for this report.) -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and two passengers departed on a local flight to a nearby airport. They arrived near sunset, dined at a local restaurant, and returned about 1 hour later. Multiple witnesses reported that the area where the helicopter was parked was dark on the night of the accident; the airport manager stated that the runway lights did not illuminate the trees at the end of the runway. After a preflight inspection, the pilot started the helicopter and announced his position and intentions over the common traffic advisory frequency. A passenger reported that she heard the pilot say, \"here we go.\" The helicopter then impacted the tops of 50-ft-tall trees about 350 ft from the departure location. Examination of the airframe and wreckage revealed no mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had accumulated 1 hour of night flight experience in the 11 months before the accident flight. Given the dark night conditions at the time of departure and his lack of recent night flight experience, it is likely that the pilot was unaware of the trees and did not successfully navigate above the trees and away from the airport.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the pilot's medical records and toxicology report revealed that he had been taking a disqualifying medication (pramipexole) since 2006. He reported the use of the medication during his aviation medical exam in 2012, and, although the medication should have been disqualifying, the aviation medical examiner issued the pilot a medical certificate. While symptoms of the disqualifying medication included \"falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including operation of motor vehicles,\" witnesses reported no abnormalities in the pilot's sleep patterns or behavior, including on the day of the flight. Based on witness statements and the pilot's long history of using this medication, it is likely that he was not affected by the medication's published symptoms during the flight.",
    "FactualNarrative": "72-hour History&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollow-up interviews with both the pilot's daughter and the pilot's girlfriend were used to construct a 72-hour history. On the night of Thursday, February 6, 2014, the pilot drove home to Tallahassee, Florida, from Jacksonville, Florida after a work related meeting. The following day the pilot drove to his girlfriend's house about 1600 and subsequently returned home about 1830. He conversed with his daughter for about 30 minutes before going to dinner with his girlfriend. At 1530 on the day of the accident, the pilot and his girlfriend picked up the second passenger from his home and subsequently drove to the pilot's house to collect his airport badge before driving to the airport. The pilot's daughter and girlfriend observed no abnormalities in the pilot's behavior or sleep patterns during these three days.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNight Flight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge (FAA-H-8083-25A),&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"While the cones adapt rapidly to changes in light intensities, the rods take much longer. Walking from bright sunlight into a dark movie theater is an example of this dark adaptation period experience. The rods can take approximately 30 minutes to fully adapt to darkness. A bright light, however, can completely destroy night adaptation, leaving night vision severely compromised while the adaptation process is repeated.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Robinson Helicopter Company R-44 Helicopter Pilot's Operating Handbook (2-7 Limitations),&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"Orientation during night flight must be maintained by visual reference to ground objects illuminated solely by lights on the ground or adequate celestial illumination.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirport Lighting Safety Advancement&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe investigation revealed there were no lights to illuminate the trees that were struck by the helicopter during the accident. The Florida Department of Transportation installed a light at the northwestern end of the airport in March 2015 to illuminate the affected trees. - The accident helicopter was based at TLH and operated by Tallahassee Helicopters. According to FAA records, the accident helicopter was manufactured in 2005. The helicopter was powered by a Lycoming IO-540-AE1A5 245 hp engine and driven by a two-blade main rotor system. The helicopter's most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on November 15, 2013; at the time it had accumulated 946.4 hours total time in service (TTIS). At the time of the accident the helicopter had accumulated 997.3 TTIS. - The departure airport was located about 350 feet east of the accident site. The airport comprised of one turf runway, which measured 2,590 feet long and 70 feet wide and was equipped with low intensity runway edge lights. There was a clear area at the north end of the airport, where the helicopter had departed from. According to the manager, the runway lights did not illuminate the trees that bordered the west side of the runway. A rural neighborhood surrounded the airport to the east and west. There was also a highway adjacent to the northern tip of the airport that ran northwest. - On February 8, 2014, about 1945 eastern standard time, a Robinson R44 II, N571AC, was substantially damaged when it impacted trees after takeoff from Wakulla County Airport (2J0), Panacea, Florida. The private pilot and one passenger were fatally injured, and another passenger sustained serious injuries. The helicopter was registered to Capital Helicopters, LLC, and was operated by a flight school. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the flight, which was destined for Tallahassee Regional Airport (TLH), Tallahassee, Florida. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the surviving passenger, the pilot planned to fly three passengers to 2J0 for dinner and return directly to TLH, which was a common flight for the pilot. On the day of the accident, the fourth occupant became ill and elected to stay home. The pilot and two passengers departed TLH about 1720 bound for 2J0. They flew a scenic route along the waterfront and landed at the north end of the airport. The pilot and his passengers finished dinner about 1935 and were then driven to the airport, which was located about 1 mile north of the restaurant. After a preflight inspection, the pilot started the helicopter and announced his position and intentions over the common traffic advisory frequency. The surviving passenger heard the pilot say, \"here we go\" and seconds later they impacted trees and came to rest inverted in shallow water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo witnesses observed the helicopter prior to the accident. One of the witnesses recalled seeing the helicopter parked at the end of runway 36 earlier that day with the tail facing north.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses who lived in the vicinity of the accident site were interviewed separately shortly after the accident and were asked to describe the weather and lighting conditions that prevailed at the time. The witnesses consistently described the lighting conditions as \"dark\" or \"very\" dark and overcast. The surviving passenger recalled a \"thin misty fog\" that was present at the time of the accident. A witness who lived about 1 mile south of the accident site described the weather conditions at the time of the accident as a dark night, overcast, with no fog. He also stated that the accident site was very dark and added there were no lights from the sky, airport or street that reached the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the surviving passenger, the pilot had requested that she sit in the left rear seat to \"even out the weight and balance.\" A few seconds after takeoff, the passenger observed trees ahead of the helicopter and called out to the pilot prior to impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe surviving passenger also remarked that the pilot was \"probably trying to fly the fastest route home\" as he was intent on returning home to spend time with his daughter and had been gone longer than planned.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn employee at the restaurant where the pilot and two passengers had dinner, reported that the group arrived about 1815. According to a receipt, none of the three patrons consumed alcoholic beverages. The customers paid their bill promptly and then exited the restaurant. The restaurant owner drove the customers to the airport. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot by the District Two Office of the Medical Examiner, Tallahassee, Florida. The cause of death was listed as \"multiple blunt force trauma.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological testing on the pilot. No carbon monoxide or ethanol were detected in the samples submitted. The testing detected the presence of Citalopram and n-desmethylcitalopram in the blood in quantities of 0.398 ug/mL and 0.533 ug/mL, respectively. Citalopram, marketed under the trade name Celexa, is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant and desmethylcitalopram is the metabolite. The testing also detected an unquantified amount of desmethylsildenafil, dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, and pramipexole in the blood and liver samples submitted. Dextrorphan is the metabolite of dextramoethorphan, a cough suppressant found in common over the counter medications. Unquantified amounts of Citalopram and n-desmethylcitalopram were also detected in the pilot's liver.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the pilot's personal medical history revealed that he had been taking pramipexole since 2006. Pramipexole, marketed under the trade name Mirapex, is a dopamine agonist used to treat Parkinsons disease and restless leg syndrome. Mirapex use is associated with serious risks including \"falling asleep while engaged in activities of daily living, including operation of motor vehicles;\" hypotension, hallucinations, and major behavioral changes. On April 5, 2012, the pilot reapplied for a second class medical certificate, at which time he reported Zocor, Trilipix, and Mirapex. Although Mirapex is a disqualifying drug, the pilot's Aviation Medical Examiner noted it as \"previously reported\" and subsequently issued him a second-class medical certificate. - A review of airports within a 50 nautical miles radius of the airport showed similar meteorological conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe following weather observations were recorded at TLH, which was located about 24 nautical miles from the accident site, at an elevation of 83 feet msl:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0053, calm wind; visibility 10 statute miles; clear skies; temperature 11 degrees C, dew point 8 degrees C; altimeter 30.15 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA representative of the National Weather Service (NWS) based in Tallahasee, Florida stated there were no weather reporting facilities closer than 24 nautical miles from the accident site that captured visibility and cloud ceilings at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the U.S. Naval Observatory, on the date of the accident, sunset occurred at 1820 and civil twilight ended at 1845. The moon rise was recorded at 1320, and was observed in transit at 2019 and set at 0320 on the following day. About 68% of the moon disc was illuminated at the time of the accident. - The pilot, age 49, held a private pilot certificate with a rating for rotorcraft-helicopter. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second-class medical certificate was issued on April 5, 2012 with the limitation, \"must wear corrective lenses for near and distant vision.\" The pilot did not possess an instrument rating.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot obtained most of his flight training for his private pilot certificate through Tallahassee Helicopters. After he received his private pilot certificate in 2012, he continued to rent helicopters from the flight school.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's logbook, as of February 1, 2014 the pilot had accumulated 334.8 total hours of flight experience, 309 hours of which were in helicopters. The pilot recorded at least 189.2 hours of flight experience in the accident helicopter make and model. He had also accumulated 22.6 total hours of night flight experience and only one hour of night flight experience in the preceding 11 months. - The accident site was located in a marsh area bordered by trees about 350 feet from the helicopter's departure point. The initial impact point was identified by several damaged tree limbs about 50 feet above the ground, which were about 25 feet from the helicopter's final resting location. The wreckage path was oriented about 340 degrees magnetic and extended from the initial impact point to where the main wreckage came to rest. The main wreckage was inverted in water and oriented on a northerly heading. The middle wire of a three strand power line, also located in the wreckage path, was severed during the accident and repaired before NTSB investigators arrived on scene. There were no indications of pre or postimpact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was subsequently recovered from the accident scene and examined at a nearby law enforcement facility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom remained attached to the fuselage and was severed about three feet from the tail rotor section. The severed tail section consisted of the tailboom structure, horizontal stabilizer, the upper and lower vertical stabilizers, and the tail rotor. The forward 10-foot section of the tailboom was canted to the left. There was no visible damage to both tail rotor blades, which also remained attached to the tail rotor gearbox. The horizontal and upper vertical stabilizers were intact, and the lower vertical stabilizer exhibited some compression damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor mast was impact separated from the helicopter and co-located with the main wreckage. For reference purposes, the two main rotor blades were arbitrarily designated \"A\" and \"B\". Blade \"A\" was bent about 45 degrees downward and segmented into thirds with most of the blade spar still intact and attached to the main rotor hub. The remaining 10 inches of \"Blade A\" blade spar were not recovered. The middle third section of the blade was partially separated and the remaining outboard third of the blade was fracture-separated parallel to the blade chord. Blade \"B\" was bent down about 30 degrees and remained intact to the blade tip. The skin and honeycomb section of the remaining 2 feet of blade had separated. Both blades exhibited compression and impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe drive belts were broken, but exhibited no signs of rolling. Both the upper and lower actuator bearings rotated freely and the sprag clutch locked and free-wheeled normally. The main rotor gearbox was detached from the airframe, broken into several pieces, and rotated freely.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine starter ring gear exhibited linear scoring that was parallel in direction to the gear's rotation. The aft surface of the upper sheave displayed circular scoring and the upper drive belt sheave exhibited multiple scores across its grooves that were consistent with machining marks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the flight control system revealed separations consistent with overload on multiple push-pull tubes. There were additional separations within the cyclic stick assembly, cyclic torque tube, and the Blade \"B\" pitch change link. Control continuity for the cyclic, collective, and anti-torque systems was established and all separations were consistent with overload fractures. All separations in the tail rotor driveshaft were consistent with bending overload. Main and tail rotor gearbox continuity was confirmed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth fuel bladder tanks were separated from the main wreckage. The fuel caps remained attached to their respective fuel tanks. The fuel lines were torn at the line outlets, but intact from the tear to the engine. Fuel line continuity was confirmed through the vent lines in the mast fairing, vent fittings on both tanks, interconnect hose, vent hoses and main tank rollover valve.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained mounted within the engine compartment. The crankshaft was rotated by hand and valve-train continuity and thumb compression were observed on all cylinders. Both magnetos remained attached to the engine and produced spark at their respective spark plug ends when tested by hand rotation of the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll spark plugs were removed and inspected with the exception of cylinder No. 6 top spark plug, which could not be removed due to airframe damage. Each spark plug electrode was intact and displayed \"normal\" combustion signatures when compared with a spark plug wear chart, with the exception of cylinder No. 5 top spark plug, which was oil fouled. A borescope examination of all cylinders did not reveal any abnormalities.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe, engine, and drive systems did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The purpose of the flight was to perform low-level aerial surveillance of power transmission lines using an external gimbal-mounted infrared camera to detect problems with the patrolled power lines. While patrolling above a power line that passed through a valley, the helicopter struck another power line that crossed perpendicular to the helicopter's flightpath and was at a higher elevation than the patrolled power line and ran from poles mounted atop higher terrain. The struck power line was not marked with high-visibility balls nor was it required to be. The sun was directly in front of the helicopter and 30 degrees above the horizon at the time of the accident, which likely made it difficult for the pilot to see the crossing wire. Postaccident examination of the helicopter did not reveal any preimpact anomalies. Given that this was a low-level surveillance flight of power transmission lines, the pilot should have familiarized himself with the power lines he was going to patrol and any other wires or obstructions in the area before the flight. It is likely that he did not adequately plan for the flight and that, if he had, he might have been aware of the power line and been able to avoid it.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\nOn January 27, 2014, about 1118 mountain standard time, a Bell model 206L-3 helicopter, N207DS, was destroyed when it impacted a wire and terrain near Silt, Colorado. The pilot and two passengers were fatally injured. The aircraft was registered to and operated by Delta Bravo Sierra Inc. under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 as an on-demand air taxi flight. The helicopter was performing aerial surveillance of power transmission lines when the accident occurred. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was not on a flight plan. The local flight originated from the Garfield County Regional Airport (RIL), Rifle, Colorado, about 1045.The operator was contracted by Holy Cross Energy, a local power utility, to perform aerial surveillance of power transmission wires using an infrared camera to detect potential problem areas on the wires. The occupants of the helicopter consisted of the pilot, an employee of Holy Cross Energy, and an employee of HOT/SHOT Infrared Inspections, Inc. It was reported that the helicopter had completed one surveillance flight earlier in the day and landed at RIL where it was refueled before departing on the accident flight. The accident occurred about 3 miles east of RIL. The power lines that were being patrolled by the helicopter at the time of the accident ran through a valley in a predominately north-south direction. Another set of power lines owned by Xcel Energy ran in a predominately east-west direction and crossed above the Holy Cross Energy power lines. Two parallel static wires ran from the top of each Xcel Energy tower to the next tower. The Excel Energy towers were located atop higher terrain, and the Holy Cross Energy power lines ran through the valley between the Xcel Energy towers. The helicopter struck the south static wire of the Xcel Energy power lines and subsequently impacted the ground. A witness reported seeing the helicopter heading south just prior to the accident. The Xcel Energy power lines were estimated to be about 170 feet above the floor of the valley where the accident occurred.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a representative of HOT/SHOT Infrared Inspections, Inc., the contract with Holy Cross Energy required video recording of the entire flight. During examination of the wreckage, two recording devices were found and retained for further examination. One of the recording devices had a secure digital (SD) memory card installed. The SD card slot of the other recording device was empty. A second SD card was not located during the wreckage examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a pilot certificate with a commercial pilot rating for helicopters and private pilot ratings for airplane single engine land and instrument airplane. He also held a second class medical certificate issued on April 18, 2013. The pilot reported a total of 8010 total flight hours at the time of his most recent medical examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was a Bell model 206L-3 helicopter, serial number 51546, manufactured in 1991. The helicopter had a single main rotor with a tail mounted anti-torque rotor.  The helicopter was configured to carry six occupants, including the flight crew. The helicopter was powered by a single Rolls-Royce (Allison) Model 250-C30S engine, serial number CAE890513S, rated to produce 435 maximum shaft horsepower.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the maintenance records indicated that the helicopter had accumulated 5,129.7 hours total time as of the date of the last inspection on January 23, 2014. The engine had accumulated 12,463.6 hours total time as of the same date. The records showed that the engine had been installed on the helicopter on September 22, 2010.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nWeather conditions recorded by the RIL Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), located about 3 miles west of the accident site, at 1053, were: wind calm, visibility 10 statute miles, scattered clouds at 11,000 feet agl, temperature -2 degrees Celsius, dew point -9 degrees Celsius, and altimeter 30.02 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFLIGHT RECORDERS&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an external gimbal mounted infrared camera (IR). Additionally, two digital video recorders were located within the wreckage along with a GeoStamp+ device. The GeoStamp+ was used to overlay video footage from the IR camera with information such as GPS location and time. The two DVR's each had a slot for insertion of a secure digital (SD) memory card. One of the DVR's contained a SD card and the other did not. The DVR's, SD card, and Geostamp+ device, were retained for further examination. Examination of the components revealed that the only recordable media present was the SD card, which contained three files. Two of the files were not pertinent to the accident flight. The third file contained video footage of the accident flight along with audio from the radio communications and the helicopter's intercom system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe recording of the accident flight began when the helicopter was already airborne. Voices of the helicopter's occupants could be heard throughout the flight. For the majority of the flight, the helicopter followed a series of power lines through various terrain. Throughout the flight, casual and professional conversation was audible between the two passengers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 11:15:20 (hh:mm:ss), the crew members discussed turning right to follow a perpendicular set of power lines and return later to capture a previous data point. The helicopter turned right and the crewmembers carried out casual conversation for the remainder of the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 11:16:21, a pair of deer came into the view of the IR camera. During this time, one of the occupants remarked \"See the deer?\" and another occupant responded \"where?\". A follow-up remark was heard: \"See the white things on the screen\", followed ultimately by an acknowledgement.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 11:16:29, intersecting power lines came into view of the IR camera. Immediately after the power lines passed, the video began to shale, with expletives heard in the background. The camera shaking intensified and discordant audio was audible until the recording ended at 11:16:36.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's wreckage was located in a valley between hills. There was scattered snow cover on the terrain. There were two sets of crossing power lines in the area of the accident site. One set of power lines ran predominately north-south on single wooden poles. The second set of power lines ran predominately east-west and were suspended on dual support pole structures. There were two static lines at the top of each pole and the power transmission lines ran below the static lines. The east-west power lines were higher than the set that ran north-south. It was reported that the south static line of the east-west running lines was severed. The helicopter was reported to have been conducting power line patrol operations on the lower north-south running set of power lines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on its left side facing west. The main fuselage structure exhibited crushing in an upward/right direction that was consistent with an impact on the left bottom of the fuselage. The tail boom was separated from the fuselage. The tail boom was broken into two pieces. The forward portion of the tail boom to include the horizontal stabilizer was located about 150 feet from the main wreckage. The aft portion of the tail boom including the tail rotor gearbox and tail rotor was located near the main wreckage. The landing gear skid tubes were separated from the cross tubes. The left skid tube was broken approximately where the forward cross tube attached. The cross tubes were broken loose from their mounts to the fuselage with the forward cross tube completely separated. The rear cross tube remained within the fuselage penetration for the tube, but was not attached. Both main rotor blades were separated from their roots. The root section of each blade remained attached to the blade grips which remained attached to the hub. The hub remained attached to the mast which was still connected to the main rotor gearbox. Various aircraft components were found around the area of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage of the helicopter was moved to an indoor facility for further examination. Examination of the helicopter's control system was conducted. The collective controls were predominately intact from the collective stick to the point of attachment at the hydraulic actuator on top of the fuselage. The anti-torque pedals on the right side were separated from the pushrod. The pushrod system was intact to the bellcrank at the bottom of the vertical pushrod tunnel. The vertical pushrod within the vertical pushrod tunnel was separated from the rod end at the bottom. The pushrod system through the tunnel at the top of the fuselage was not examined due to crush damage that prevented exposure of the area. The pushrod that ran from the bellcrank just aft of the rear cabin bulkhead was still attached to a portion of the bellcrank. The bellcrank arm was broken.  The aft end of this pushrod was still attached to the next bellcrank at the bottom. The upper part of the bellcrank was still attached to the pushrod that ran through the tailboom but the pushrod was broken into several pieces. One break coincided with the forward separation point of the tailboom. The pieces of the pushrod were matched and a section of the pushrod was found to be missing during the wreckage review.  The missing portion was approximately 2 feet in length and is presumed to have remained at the wreckage site, possibly obscured by snow. The aft rod end of the pushrod was fractured. The threaded portion remained in the pushrod while the spherical rod end portion remained attached to the bellcrank on the tail rotor gearbox. The tail rotor gearbox was separated from the tail boom. The tail rotor would turn when rotating the input shaft of the tail rotor gearbox.  Actuation of the bellcrank confirmed actuation of the pitch angle of the tail rotor blades. The cyclic system was examined and the yoke that connects the right and left cyclic sticks to the mixer at the bottom of the vertical pushrod tunnel was fractured into 3 pieces. The yoke remained attached to the mixer and the right cyclic. The fractures were in the arm of the yoke connecting the left cyclic. The two vertical cyclic pushrods within the broom closet remained attached at both the mixer and the connection above the fuselage near the hydraulic actuator. All of the various control linkages on top of the fuselage remained attached and intact up to the swash plate. The ears where the pitch change links to the main rotor blades attached had broken loose from the rotating portion of the swash plate. The upper portion of one pitch change link pushrod remained attached to the bellcrank on the blade grip. The lower portion of this link along with the broken ear from the swash plate was found on top of the fuselage. The upper rod end and pushrod barrel for the other pitch change link remained attached to the bellcrank on the blade grip. The remainder of this pitch change pushrod was not found.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo anomalies were found with respect to the flight control system that could be attributed to a pre-impact condition.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor driveshaft components were located and laid out on the shop floor. All of the bearing mounts had been separated from the tailboom with the exception of the most aft hanger bearing. Five sections of the tail rotor driveshaft were recovered. One section was not located during the exam and is presumed to have remained at the accident site.&#x0D;\nExamination of the rotor mast revealed a spiral scrape through the paint that started just above the swash plate and progressed upward toward the blade hub. The lower fixed portion of the swash plate assembly was fractured.  The main rotor blades rotated when rotation of the input coupling was performed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo anomalies were found with respect to the drive system components that could be attributed to a pre-impact condition.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was removed from the helicopter for further examination. Both the compressor and power turbine could be rotated by hand with no binding or scraping detected. The compressor and turbine blades that were visible showed no abnormalities. The N2 drive train was free and continuous from the 4th stage power turbine wheel to the N2 tachometer generator gearbox. The N1 drive train was continuous from the compressor to the N1 tachometer generator gearbox. The power turbine governor sustained impact damage. The upper and lower chip detectors were clean when removed. No fuel was found in the inlet line on the fuel control. The fuel line between the check valve and the fuel nozzle contained a small amount of fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo anomalies were found with respect to the engine or its systems that could be attributed to a pre-impact condition.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe forward fuselage, upper and lower wire strike cutters, and the center spine of the windshield showed no evidence of a wire impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor driveshaft cover had marks consistent with a main rotor blade impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nA postmortem autopsy of the pilot was performed by Rocky Mountain Forensic Services, PLLC. The autopsy report indicated the cause of death as multiple injuries consistent with the reported circumstances.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing was performed by the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. Testing results were negative for all substances in the screening profile.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe power lines that were struck were not marked with high-visibility marking balls. Federal regulations establish standards for determining obstructions to air navigation. 14 CFR 77.23 states, in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n(a) An existing object, including a mobile object, is, and a future object would be, an obstruction to air navigation if it is of greater height than any of the following heights or surfaces:&#x0D;\n(1) A height of 500 feet above ground level at the site of the object.&#x0D;\n(2) A height that is 200 feet above ground level or above the established airport elevation, whichever is higher, within 3 nautical miles of the established reference point of an airport, excluding heliports, with its longest runway more than 3,200 feet in actual length, and that height increases in the proportion of 100 feet for each additional nautical mile of distance from the airport up to a maximum of 500 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident occurred about 3.2 nautical miles from RIL, which had a runway measuring 7,000 feet in length.The airport elevation was 5,537 feet, and the elevation at the accident site was about 5,525 feet. The wires that were struck were about 170 feet above the accident site elevation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident the sun was about 30 degrees above the horizon at an azimuth of 162 degrees. The flight path of the helicopter at the time of the accident was about 165 degrees, placing the sun directly in front of the helicopter. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "After a day of aerial application flights, the pilot landed in a farm field and had the helicopter serviced with fuel from a truck before departing on the accident flight. A witness observed the helicopter descending toward an open field from an altitude about 150 feet above ground level. The helicopter then descended to about 50 feet, leveled briefly, then \"fell\" straight to the ground, and erupted in flames. The wreckage was partially consumed by a postimpact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the wreckage following the accident revealed that the engine's carburetor float bowl was absent of fuel and contaminated with a rust-colored powder, which contained both ferrous and non-ferrous metal. Detailed examination of particulate matter collected from the filter housing of the fuel truck used to service the helicopter showed those components to be similarly contaminated. Additionally, during a postaccident demonstration of the procedure used to fuel the helicopter, the initial fuel dispensed was brown and gold in color. The operator of the fuel truck noted that it was typical to continue dispensing fuel into a separate container until it \"turned blue,\" before beginning to fill the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe extent to which the fuel onboard the helicopter at the time of the accident was contaminated could not be determined due to the extent of the post-impact fire and lack of available fuel samples from the helicopter. However; based on the powdered contamination recovered from the carburetor float bowl, it is likely that the fuel contamination was significant enough to result in a partial or total loss of engine power, which would have required that the pilot conduct an off-airport precautionary landing, or autorotation and forced landing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's toxicology testing revealed a carbon monoxide level that was consistent with the autopsy findings of abundant soot in the upper and lower airways and indicated exposure to combustion products in the postimpact fire. It was unlikely that an elevated level of carbon monoxide was present in the pilot's blood before that crash. Toxicology testing also indicated that the pilot had used diphenhydramine before the accident. Diphenhydramine, a sedating antihistamine used to treat allergy symptoms and as a sleep aid. Diphenhydramine can cause marked sedation, altered mood, and impaired cognitive and psychomotor performance may. The pilot's diphenhydramine levels were above the therapeutic range, but may have been redistributed following death. Thus, it is likely the pilot had therapeutic levels of diphenhydramine in his system at the time of the crash. The pilot's time-critical decision-making and ability to perform an effective autorotation and/or landing were likely impaired by the use of diphenhydramine.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The fuel truck that supplied the helicopter with the fuel and chemical for the spray operation was inspected shortly after the accident. The ground handler responsible for running the truck was asked to demonstrate his procedures for daily operations. He explained that when he turned on the pump and expended fuel, he would flow about 2 gallons of fuel into a bucket until the fuel turned blue, fill up a water bottle, and conduct a visual \"clear and bright\" check of the fuel. The ground handler subsequently demonstrated this procedure, activated the pump and expended fuel into a bucket. The fluid observed was initially gold and brown in color and then eventually changed to a blue color. - According to FAA airworthiness records, the accident helicopter was manufactured in 1981, and was powered by a Lycoming VO435 reciprocating engine. A review of the helicopter's maintenance records revealed that the engine's most recent overhaul was completed in July 2013, and a serviceable carburetor was installed in October 2013. The helicopter's most recent annual inspection was also completed in October 2013, and at that time the helicopter had accumulated 7,915 total hours of operation. Since that time the helicopter had accumulated 33 additional flight hours. - On December 6, 2013, about 1630 eastern standard time, a Texas Helicopter Corporation M74L, N1001N, operated by Spray Copter LLC., was destroyed after impacting the ground during a positioning flight near Sebring, Florida. The commercial pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the flight that departed a local farm field about 1615, and was destined for Sebring Regional Airport (SEF), Sebring, Florida. The positioning flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the course of the day, the helicopter was conducting aerial application flights in the local area. According to the operator's ground crew manager, about 400 acres had been treated with insecticide, and the purpose of the accident flight was to reposition the helicopter from a farm field to SEF, where the pilot planned to wash the helicopter and change the engine oil. Before departing the farm field, the helicopter was serviced with fuel from a truck, which was also used to transport chemicals used during aerial application flights.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness observed the helicopter as it approached where he was working, traveling to the southwest. He estimated that the helicopter was flying at an altitude of about 150 feet above the ground..  The helicopter then, \"dipped down\" to between 50 and 75 feet above the ground, and again leveled. The helicopter then \"fell\" straight to the ground. The helicopter subsequently impacted the ground, and burst into flames. As he was standing near an operating farm tractor, the witness was not able to hear the helicopter as it approached. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot on December 7, 2013 by the Highlands County Medical Examiner's office. The medical examiner determined that the cause of death was thermal burns and smoke inhalation and the manner of death was accident. The pathologist did not identify any natural disease of the heart or brain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing performed by the FAA's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute found 18% carbon monoxide in the heart blood. In addition, diphenhydramine was detected in the heart blood (0.147 ug/ml) and urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDiphenhydramine was a sedating antihistamine used to treat allergy symptoms and as a sleep aid. It was available over the counter under various trade names including Benadryl and Unisom. Diphenhydramine carried the following warning: may impair mental and/or physical ability required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks (e.g., driving, operating heavy machinery). The therapeutic range for the drug was from 0.0250 to 0.1120 ug/ml. - The weather conditions reported at SEF, at 1559, included wind from 140 degrees at 09 knots, 10 statute miles visibility, clear skies below 12,000 feet, a temperature of 31 C, a dew point of 19 C, and an altimeter setting of 30.10 inches of mercury. - According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a rating for helicopter and airplane single engine land. The pilot also held a mechanic certificate with ratings for airframe and power plant. The pilot was issued an FAA second class medical certificate on January 29, 2013 with the medical restriction \"must have available lenses for near vision.\" In January 2013, the pilot reported he had accumulated 10,800 total hours of flight experience, 500 hours of which had been accumulated in the preceding six months. According to the pilot's personal flight log, as of October 2013 he had accumulated 11,052 total hours of flight experience. - An agricultural GPS system was retained and forwarded to the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory for download. No data relevant to the accident flight were recovered. - The accident site was located in an open sod field located 1.3 nautical miles west of SEF. The debris path was about 120 feet in circumference, and located in close proximity to an irrigation canal. The helicopter came to rest on its right side and was oriented 210 degrees magnetic. The debris field was oriented roughly 110 degrees magnetic. The cockpit, rotor system, tail boom, empennage section, and spray boom were all located 20 feet from the initial impact point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the cockpit revealed that the windscreen was shattered and destroyed. The left door was removed for the flight and the right door was attached and destroyed due to thermal damage. The instrument panel was still attached, thermal damaged and laying on its right side. The altimeter was set at 29.84 inches of mercury and indicated 770 feet. The left and right anti-torque pedals were attached and unremarkable. The cyclic control was thermally damaged and severed at its base. The collective pitch control was thermally damaged and fractured at the base consistent with overload failure. The engine firewall and pilot seat were thermally damaged and crushed forward.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain rotor flight control continuity was confirmed from the cyclic and collective pitch controls to the main rotor blades. Several separations were noted, though all were consistent with overload or fire damage. The equalizer beam was thermal damaged and the respective pitch links were separated consistent with bending overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne of the rotor blades exhibited thermal damage from the blade root to 8 feet outboard. From the blade tip to 11 feet inboard were chord wise scratches consistent with a ground scar of the same length, located adjacent to the wreckage. The trailing edge was buckled for the entire length of the blade. The pitch link was connected and thermal damaged. The drag link was sheared and the remaining bolt was inside the connecting hole of the blade.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe remaining rotor blade was thermally damaged on the entire length of the blade underside. The blade also exhibited separation of the trailing edge for the entire length of the blade. About 5 feet outboard the blade root, the trailing edge was torn chord wise to the blade spar. The pitch link was separated consistent with overload failure. The drag link was sheared and a portion of the bolt remained inside the connecting hole of the blade.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom was bent upward about 30 degrees with the lower attach points fractured. About 6 feet aft of the attach points, the tail boom was twisted 180 degrees and resting on the ground. The lower support tubes exhibited fractures that were consistent with bending overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTail rotor flight control continuity was confirmed from the anti-torque pedals to the tail rotor. Tail rotor drive continuity was traced from the transmission to the tail rotor gearbox. The tail rotor driveshaft was disconnected at the base of the transmission consistent with tension force. The shaft was fractured about 7 feet aft of the transmission consistent with torsional overload. The tail rotor remained attached and was free to rotate. One blade was bent 4 inches from the root and the other blade was bent 4 inches, 7 inches, and 14 inches from the blade root. The tail rotor gearbox was intact, undamaged, and unremarkable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left landing skid was fractured 5 feet aft of the toe and remained connected to the left spray boom apparatus. The right landing skid was fractured 6 feet aft of the toe and remained connected to the right spray boom apparatus. The rear landing skid crossbow remained attached to the airframe and bent aft 20 degrees. The front crossbow remained attached to the airframe and was crushed upwards into the flight control torque tube area behind the cockpit.  The helicopter was equipped with two chemical tanks and one fuel tank that ruptured during the crash sequence. The fuel tank departed the mounting pedestal and was located underneath the main rotor mast in the soil. It was ruptured, thermally damaged, and absent of fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVisual examination of the engine revealed that the cooling fan exhibited reverse bending signatures on nine of the blades, while the remaining nine blades had separated completely. The engine oil sump was breached and absent of oil.  The oil suction screen was absent of metallic debris and unobstructed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine crankshaft was rotated via the engine-driven fuel pump port. Continuity of the main drive and valve train was confirmed from the power output of the engine to the rear accessory gears. Rotation of the crankshaft produced suction and compression on all cylinders. Visual inspection cylinder bores with a lighted bore scope revealed no anomalies.  The left magneto remained attached to the engine, but did not produce spark when the input shaft was rotated, and was subsequently disassembled.  A small amount of oil was observed in the magneto housing but no damage to the ignition points or other internal components observed.  The right magneto was separated from the engine and produced spark from all 6 ignition towers when rotated by hand. The top and bottom spark plugs were removed, and their electrodes appeared medium brown in color with normal wear. The engine hydraulic pump, engine tachometer, and rotor tachometer were free to rotate. Battery power was applied to the engine starter resulting in free rotation of the crankshaft and valvetrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor was removed and inspected for contamination and debris. The carburetor bowl was absent of fuel and contained rust-colored powder. The carburetor inlet screen was absent of debris. The carburetor float was dry and coated with the same substance that was located in the carburetor bowl along with small metallic fragments. The airframe fuel filter screen was absent of debris or obstruction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel filter, hose, and fuel pump from the fuel truck last used to service the helicopter were retained and cut open for internal examination. The components contained the same rust-colored substance that was observed in the carburetor bowl and on the floats.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe powder recovered from the carburetor bowl and fuel truck components were forwarded to the NTSB Materials Laboratory for detailed examination utilizing a 20-200X zoom stereomicroscope and an x-ray fluorescence analyzer. With the exception of the fuel hose, material consisting of a reddish brown particulate of relatively uniform size and morphology were present throughout. Several metallic colored flakes were also present in the material recovered from the carburetor bowl and the fuel filter element. The elemental composition of the material consisted mainly of aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn). -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The flight was dispatched to pick up a patient at a hospital and transport him to another hospital near the helicopter's home base. The pilot performed a weather check, and the flight departed with two medical staff on board. Night, visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the departure helipad. Satellite tracking data revealed that the helicopter proceeded in an easterly direction, following a US highway. The helicopter then climbed in right-hand turn until the satellite data ended; the helicopter was about 1,116 feet above ground level (agl). The wreckage was found, burning, in a wooded area, about 3,300 feet south of the US highway. No eyewitnesses to the accident were located. The helicopter impacted the trees at a steep angle, and the orientation of the main wreckage was indicative of a loss of helicopter control before impact. The wreckage was largely consumed by a postcrash fire. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the airframe, rotor system, and engine did not reveal evidence of a preexisting mechanical malfunction of failure. Rotational signatures on the main rotor and engine indicated that the engine was producing power at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with night vision goggles (NVG) and NVG-capable lighting. The pilot had been trained on the use of NVG about 12 months before the accident. The helicopter was not equipped for flight under instrument flight rules.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the weather conditions revealed that, at an airport within 2 miles of the accident site, few clouds were observed at 800 feet agl, and a broken ceiling existed at 1,200 feet agl. A review of the helicopter's ground track revealed two obstacles in the immediate vicinity, an unlit, nonoperational cellular tower, 140-feet tall, and a water tower, about 115-feet tall. The helicopter was equipped with a Helicopter Terrain Avoidance Warning System (HTAWS). Although recorded HTAWS data was not  available, research and flight testing revealed that the pilot may have received an in-flight obstacle alert, prompting a climb. Considering the low clouds and night conditions that probably existed along the last segment of the flight's track, it is likely that the pilot initiated a climb and inadvertently entered instrument meteorological conditions, where a loss of helicopter control occurred.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHTOn October 22, 2013, about 0605 central daylight time (CDT), a Eurocopter AS 350 B3, N353HW, impacted trees and terrain near Somerville, Tennessee. The certificated commercial pilot, a registered nurse, and a respiratory therapist were fatally injured; the helicopter was destroyed by impact forces and a post-crash fire. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Memphis Medical Center Air Ambulance Service, doing business as Hospital Wing, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, as a positioning flight. The flight operated on a company visual flight rules flight plan. The flight originated from Hospital Wing Heliport (2TN0), Memphis, Tennessee, at 0547 and was en route to Whitehurst Field Heliport (60TN), Bolivar, Tennessee.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to company personnel, the accident pilot arrived for work about 1730 on October 21 and began his flight planning procedures, which included a review of the local area weather and completion of the company's risk assessment checklist. About 0025 on October 22, a call came in to company, requesting helicopter services to Piperton, Tennessee to pick up a patient. The pilot completed a weather check at 0026 and the flight departed 2TN0 at 0035. About two minutes later, the pilot aborted the flight and returned to 2TN0 due to low ceilings. The flight was cancelled due to weather.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0137, another call was received by the company for helicopter services in Olive Branch, Mississippi. The accident pilot declined the flight due to weather.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0500, another request for helicopter services was received by the company, to pick up a patient at 60TN and transport him to Memphis. Dispatch records indicated that the accident pilot performed a weather check at 0500 and the flight was dispatched at 0503. According to satellite tracking data provided by the operator, the helicopter departed 2TN0 at 0547 and proceeded in an easterly direction, following U.S. Highway 64. About 18 minutes later, the helicopter was observed in a climb and in a right turn away from the observed course. The last data point indicated that the helicopter was on a course of 146 degrees and at 98 knots ground speed and at an altitude of 1,560 feet above mean sea level (msl) or about 1,116 feet above ground level (agl).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator dispatched two aircraft to the last known position of N353HW after the pilot did not make the normal 10-minute position report. One of the pilots observed a fire in a rural area about 19 miles west of 60TN. First responders confirmed that the helicopter had crashed at that location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral local residents were interviewed after the accident. They reported hearing a helicopter in their vicinity near the time of the accident; however, no one reported hearing the helicopter crash. Also, no eyewitnesses to the accident were found. Their statements are included in the public docket for this accident investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 47, held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter, instrument-helicopter, and airplane single engine land. According to the operator, his total flight experience was 2,441 hours, including 521 hours in the accident helicopter make and model, and 2,250 hours in rotorcraft. His flight experience during the 90 days prior to the accident was 33 hours, including 10 hours in the 30 days prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the pilot flew previously with the Memphis Police Department (MPD), where he accumulated about 400 hours in the AS 350. He received all of his night vision goggle (NVG) training and experience at Hospital Wing, since MPD did to utilize NVG.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTraining records provided by the operator revealed that the pilot completed AS 350 B3 initial training (ground and flight) on October 31, 2012. Ground training consisted of 51 hours and flight training consisted on 12.1 hours, including 5.8 hours with NVG. The training was conducted \"in house\" by the Hospital Wing Chief Pilot. The training included inadvertent instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) scenarios in a simulator. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral company pilots, supervisors, and nurses were interviewed following the accident. In general, the accident pilot was described as a good pilot, well-liked by the other company pilots and medical staff, and conscientious. He flew \"by the book,\" did not \"press\" the weather, and utilized the company's risk assessment tools.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter was a Eurocopter AS350 B3 model that was manufactured in 2001. It was equipped with a three-blade main rotor system and a two-blade tail rotor system and was powered by a Turbomeca Arriel 2B engine rated at 871 shaft horsepower. The helicopter was purchased new by the operator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with skid-type landing gear, NVG and NVG-compatible lighting, an Aspen Avionics 1000H primary flight display/multi-function display (PFD/MFD), a vehicle engine multifunction display (VEMD), an autopilot, an enhanced ground proximity warning system (EGPWS), and a Thales/Sextant Digital Electronic Control Unit (DECU). The helicopter was not equipped for flight under instrument flight rules. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the helicopter was maintained under the manufacturer's inspection program. The last recorded aircraft time was 6,391.1 hours on October 13, 2013. The most recent aircraft inspection occurred on October 11, 2013, which was a 30-hour inspection. The last annual inspection occurred on July 17, 2013, at 6,274.3 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest weather observation facility to the accident site was Fayette County Airport (FYE), located about 1.5 nautical miles (nm) south-southwest of the accident site. The airport elevation was about 436 feet msl. The 0556 surface weather observation (about 9 minutes prior to the accident) included a broken ceiling at 1,600 feet agl, wind from 030 degrees at 4 knots, visibility 10 statute miles or greater, temperature 11 degrees C, dew point minus 1 degrees C, and altimeter setting 30.05 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FYE observation about 2 minutes after the accident, at 0607, included calm wind, few clouds at 800 feet agl, a broken ceiling at 1,200 feet agl, a broken ceiling at 6,000 feet agl, visibility 10 statute miles or greater, temperature 11 degrees C, dew point minus 1 degrees C, and altimeter setting 30.05 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Memphis International Airport (MEM) observation (5 nm SE of 2TN0), at 0554 (about 3 minutes prior to takeoff) included wind from 010 at 7 knots, few clouds at 1,200 feet agl, scattered clouds at 4,700 feet agl, overcast ceiling at 5,500 feet agl, and visibility 10 statute miles or greater.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOfficial sunrise at Somerville, on October 22, 2013 was about 0710 and civil twilight was about 0644.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aircraft wreckage debris was located in a wooded area surrounded by cotton and soybean fields, approximately 3,300 feet south of U.S. Highway 64, in Somerville. The accident site elevation was about 372 feet. The majority of the aircraft structure, including the cockpit, instruments and controls, was burned and consumed by impact forces and a post-impact fire. The VEMD exhibited extensive thermal damage during the post-crash fire and further examination was not attempted. The helicopter impacted trees prior to impacting the ground. The energy path was generally oriented on a magnetic heading of about 090 degrees and was about 100 feet in length. The flight path angle, measured from broken trees to the initial impact crater, was about 50 degrees. All static and dynamic components of the helicopter were accounted for at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll three main rotor blades exhibited signatures consistent with powered impact strikes throughout the length of the blades. The red and yellow blades showed more extensive damage, where impact forces resulted in blade delamination. Severe fraying was also observed at the outboard tips of all three blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom was consumed by a post-impact fire and the horizontal stabilizers exhibited both thermal and impact damage. The vertical stabilizer and vertical fin were consumed by fire. The engine output-to-tail rotor drive shaft flange remained bolted to the engine; however, all three flange tangs that attached to the flex couplings were bent and pulled aft and separated at the flex coupling. The splined coupling remained attached to the flex coupling on the tail rotor forward steel drive shaft. The splined portion on the tail rotor drive shaft was separated with no visible anomalies to the splines. The length of the tail rotor drive shaft was bent in a \"u\" shape, approximately mid-span from impact forces and was broken just aft of the third hanger support bearing. The aft section of the drive shaft was separated and partially damaged from post impact fire and was separated at the aft flexible coupling flange. The aft flange mount was thermally separated from the tail rotor drive shaft; the flexible couplings were intact to the coupling system but broken away from the tail rotor gearbox forward mounts. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth tail rotor blades remained attached to the tail rotor gearbox; there was no visible impact damage observed to the leading edges; however, both blades exhibited thermal decomposition. The hub could not be pulled off the shaft due to thermal damage; however, the woodruff key appeared to be in place when the nut was removed. The gearbox oil cap was melted away and the oil was consumed. Subsequent disassembly of the tail rotor gearbox revealed no anomalies except for post-crash fire signatures. No metallic debris was observed on the chip detector. The yaw load compensator was observed to be thermally damaged and separated from the helicopter and was found within the main wreckage area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity could not be confirmed due to post-crash fire damage. The cyclic, collective, and anti-torque pedals were found lying loose in the cockpit area of the fire-consumed main wreckage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's fuel system was consumed by fire and no on-site documentation of fuel status could be performed; however, the operator reported that the helicopter departed 2TN0 with 101 gallons of fuel on board.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe remaining components of the hydraulic system were examined by the investigation team. When the hydraulic pump pulley wheel was turned by hand, a residual amount of clean-looking red hydraulic fluid was jettisoned. The pump was disassembled; the pulley wheel spline (female) and the pump spline (male) were intact. The pump gears appeared clean and operational. All of the hydraulic lines were consumed in the post-crash fire; except for the partial line segments still attached to the fore/aft servo. The servos from the transmission were examined; each of the servos exhibited various degrees of fire and impact damage. The left and right main rotor servo accumulators were empty, or near depleted (the left servo emitted a small, but notable, amount of gas when the Schrader valve was depressed). The fore/aft accumulator had considerably more gas pressure when the Schrader valve was depressed. And, it was also noted that the top cylinder was separated in overload from the housing body at its attachment bolts. Similarly, the spine on the right servo housing body exhibited a crack along the length of its body. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth landing gear skids and cross tubes were fractured in multiple locations. The aft half of the fractured left landing gear skid was lodged into the ground vertically and could not be removed by hand, with the aft end of the section under the soil. A forward section of the right skid, about 2 feet in length, was broken open and tree matter was found lodged inside the tube.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was found lying on its left side and covered by the burnt remains of the engine cowling. The hydro-mechanical unit (HMU) was separated from the accessory gearbox and was held in place by fuel piping. The oil and fuel lines were burnt from the post-crash fire; however, all appeared properly attached and safety wired. The axial compressor blades were all bent and broken consistent with a dent at the nine o'clock position of the compressor casing, indicative of gas generator rotation at the time of impact. The gas generator could not be turned by hand. The exhaust pipe was crushed and the free turbine, reduction gearbox, and power shaft/freewheel shaft could not be turned by hand. The left side of the turbine case and linking tube were also crushed, indicating impact with the ground on the left side. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered to a storage facility where a partial engine teardown was performed. The exhaust duct was cut off with a plasma torch, revealing that the free turbine blades were broken by impact forces with the support struts during the accident sequence, indicative of rotation during impact. The angle and break pattern of the blades were consistent with impact damage. The reduction gearbox was removed for examination of the input pinion alignment marks. The marks were found misaligned in the tightening direction approximately 1 to 1.5mm, which was consistent with power delivery at the time of a main rotor strike. The DECU exhibited extensive thermal damage during the post-crash fire and further examination was not attempted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postmortem examination of the pilot was performed at the offices of the Chief Medical Examiner, West Tennessee Regional Forensic Center, Memphis, Tennessee on October 23, 2013. The autopsy report noted the cause of death as \"Multiple blunt force injuries\" and the manner of death was \"Accident.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForensic toxicology testing was performed on specimens of the pilot by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory (CAMI), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The CAMI toxicology report indicated negative for ethanol and drugs in muscle. Testing for carbon monoxide and cyanide was not performed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTest Flight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the accident helicopter's flight path revealed two obstacles within less than a half mile of the accident helicopter's last recorded flight position. These obstacles included a 140-foot-tall, unlit, non-operational cellular tower to the east and a water tower, approximately 115-foot-tall to the west of this position. The obstacles' close proximity to the helicopter's course led to a flight test intended to examine if the helicopter's onboard Helicopter Terrain Avoidance Warning System (HTAWS) may have prompted any alerts during the flight. A flight test was conducted on March 24, 2014, which was flown by a representative of the helicopter operator who was accompanied by representatives from the aircraft manufacturer, FAA, and NTSB. The test helicopter, N857HW, was a Eurocopter AS 350 B3 model and was equipped with similar avionics as the accident helicopter, which included a Garmin G530 global positioning system with HTAWS. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA path spanning about 3 nm was flown nine times at decrementing altitudes. Each pass began over highway 64 about 3 nm west of the accident helicopter's final radar target and ended slightly north of the accident site. The HTAWS generated both obstacle and terrain caution alerts; two alerts for the cellular tower were heard when the test flight flew the path at 300 feet agl and three alerts for the water tower when the test flight flew the path between 350 feet and 400 feet agl. There were no HTAWS alerts issued during flight at the accident helicopter's reported altitudes; however, during the test flight helicopter's descent the HTAWS issued a terrain caution just beyond the second to last radar target. The helicopter's radar altimeter read 300 feet agl when the terrain alert was issued. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGarmin HTAWS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGarmin, the HTAWS developer, conducted a simulation using the accident helicopter's flight data provided by the NTSB. The test apparatus included a GNS530W GPS loaded with software, terrain, and obstacle databases that were valid at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\nThe purpose of the simulation was to identify obstacle or terrain alerts that may have been issued during the accident flight. The accident helicopter's flight path was flown six times in normal alerting mode and then in reduced protection mode. To simulate potential terrain alerts the system was also programmed to fly the accident helicopter's last five radar targets multiple times while decreasing the altitude of each pass by 100 feet. &#x0D;\nDuring the accident flight the helicopter encountered 100 feet of gradually rising terrain near the second to last radar target. In the simulation, one terrain alert was issued during level flight about 700 feet msl and was also located near the second to last radar target. According to a representative of Garmin, the system will issue terrain alerts for an aircraft in straight and level flight if the aircraft descends below 400 feet agl. The representative also stated that for descending flight the HTAWS system can issue terrain alerts at higher altitudes with zero vertical speed, but added that the simulator was not setup to replicate vertical paths. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRisk Assessment&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHospital Wing had a formal risk assessment program at the time of the accident. According to Hospital Wing, a risk assessment form was completed at the beginning of the pilot's duty shift. Included with the risk assessment was a crew briefing checklist that included crew names, weather minimums, local weather observations and forecasts, and in-flight communication procedures. Based on interviews with Hospital Wing flight crews and staff, the pilot routinely utilized the risk assessment tool and briefed his medical crew on any risks pertinent to that flight.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe risk assessment form evaluated static risks (such as low pilot experience and inoperative aircraft equipment) and dynamic risks (such as poor weather and lack of night lighting). Each category was given numerical values, which were added to determine a total static and dynamic risk value. Higher risk values indicated increased risk. Points were also subtracted in certain situations (such as high pilot experience and NVG usage). A value greater than 14 resulted in a \"no go\" situation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe total static and dynamic risk calculated by the pilot at 1759 on the evening prior to the accident was \"11,\" which included the following risk factors: less than one year experience in emergency medical services, deteriorating weather trend, and night flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA copy of the risk assessment form was provided to investigators, which was initialed by the pilot. The pilot entered hand-written notes on the form, indicating \"Precipitation\" (3 risk points) and \"Temp/Dew point within 3 degrees\" (3 risk points); however, the time the notes were entered could not be determined. The following notes were also observed, \"Updated after Mid\" and \"After midnite rain.\" -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "As the helicopter departed from the oil platform's helipad, witnesses heard a \"pop\" followed by a high-pitch screeching noise coming from the back of the engine. The helicopter nosed-over and dove into the water with the emergency floats extended. Examination of the engine revealed that one of the second-stage turbine disk blades had liberated due to a high-cycle fatigue (HCF) crack. The crack propagated until the blade separated due to material overload, which resulted in extensive damage to all of the third-stage turbine disk blades and most of the fourth-stage turbine disk blades. Metallurgical analysis of the liberated blade revealed no material anomalies. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the engine manufacturer, there was no history of second-stage turbine blade failure due to HCF at the same spanwise position as the accident blade. A dynamics analysis of the second-stage turbine wheel revealed no mode crossing within or above the normal engine operating range that would be consistent with HCF initiation at the point where the blade failed. Several potential failure scenarios were also evaluated; however, none yielded any evidence to support the blade failing as it did. The engine was not equipped with an engine-monitoring system that could have identified any anomalies that may have initiated the HCF crack or contributed to the failure of the second-stage turbine blade. Although the surviving passengers stated that the platform was not venting methane at the time of the accident and an eyewitness said he did not see methane being vented, platform operating records revealed that methane was being vented continuously on the day of the accident. However, the actual volume of methane released at the time of the accident and whether it was ingested into the engine on takeoff could not be determined. The HCF crack was a pre-existing condition and was not the result of a sudden ingestion of methane on the day of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA low-level of diphenhydramine, a sedating antihistamine, was detected in the pilot's blood and urine, but it could not be determined if it impaired the pilot's ability to operate the helicopter.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn October 9, 2013, about 0720 central daylight time, a Bell 206L-3, N54LP, was substantially damaged when it impacted water shortly after takeoff from the Main Pass (MP) 107D oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The commercial pilot was fatally injured and the three passengers were seriously injured. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Panther Helicopters, Inc., Belle Chasse, Louisiana. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and a company visual flight rules flight plan was filed for the business flight, which was destined for the Belle Chasse Heliport (06LA), Belle Chasse, Louisiana. The flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 135.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flight was a routine crew change at the MP107D oil platform, which consisted of dropping off three oil platform employees, picking up three other employees, then returning to 06LA. The pilot and three passengers departed 06LA about 0633 and flew direct to MP107D. After landing on MP107D, the pilot did not shut down the helicopter and stayed at the controls with the main rotor turning until the crew change was complete.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness standing on the MP108E oil platform, which is about 300-to 400 yards from MP107D and affords a clear and unobstructed view of the MP107D platform, saw the helicopter sitting east-southeast on the helipad with its main rotor blades turning. The witness said three people got off the helicopter and three other people got on. He described the weather as \" stale \" and the wind sock was \" limp. \" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1 to 2 minutes later, the witness observed the helicopter pull up into a 3 to 4-foot-high hover over the helipad and make a slight bearing change toward the east. He said that, at that point, everything was completely normal with the helicopter. The helicopter then moved forward and started to take off toward the east. The witness said as soon as the helicopter cleared the helipad's skirting, he saw a flash and a large (10-foot-high x 10-foot-wide)  \"poof \" or \" cloud \" of white smoke come from directly under the main rotor blades near the exhaust section of the helicopter. This was followed by a loud, high-pitched, screeching noise, as if the engine were being revved up. The witness said this \" poof \" of smoke occurred when the helicopter was parallel to a flare boom that extended directly out from the platform and was positioned on the north side of the helipad. The helicopter then nosed over toward the water; cleared the helipad's skirting and did not strike the flare boom as it descended. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe witness said he saw the helicopter's emergency floats fully expand before it impacted the water. The helicopter hit the water hard with the main rotors still turning; became completely submerged and rolled inverted. The witness could see the helicopter's skids near the surface of the water and noted that one emergency float (he could not recall which) had completely separated from the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe witness did not see any occupants coming to the surface and used his very high frequency handheld radio to issue a \" may-day-call. \" He also directed a field boat, which was at the base of the MP108E platform, to the helicopter. He said that by the time the boat arrived, two deck hands had already stripped down and jumped into the jellyfish-infested water to help the helicopter occupants. They were able to get three of the four occupants out of the helicopter and onto the field boat despite one of the deckhands having an allergic reaction to the jellyfish stings. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe witness said he did not see any methane gas being vented from the flare boom on the morning of the accident; however, he did see a large (size of an automobile) \" methane cloud \" coming from the flare boom the day before the accident between 12 and 5 pm. The methane cloud was located where he saw the white smoke on the day of the accident. The witness said he has seen methane being vented from the MP107D flare boom on several occasions and that \" a lot of gas \" is vented several times a week.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a telephone interview, one of the passengers on the helicopter (Passenger 1), stated that he had just completed a 14-day \" hitch \" on the MP107D oil platform and was headed back to Louisiana. On the morning of the accident, he and the two other platform employees prepared the platform for a crew change and waited for the helicopter to arrive. Once it had, he loaded his bags and was the last of the three passengers to board the helicopter. He boarded the helicopter via the left rear door and sat in the rear left seat, facing forward. He then donned an inflatable life vest, put on a headset, and fastened his seatbelt making sure it was secure and snug. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPassenger 1 said that once everyone was fastened in, they gave the pilot a \" thumbs-up \" and the pilot prepared to depart. At this point, everything regarding the flight was \" normal. \" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe said the helicopter lifted up from the platform and began forward flight. When the helicopter was over the water, he heard a loud noise overhead as if the transmission was coming a part. The passenger who was seated next to him (Passenger 2) asked, \" What's that? \" to which Passenger 1 responded,\" hold on. \"  He reported that they then hit the water with a \" big splash. \" Before impact, he did not hear any alarms going off in the cockpit and did not remember the emergency floats expanding. The pilot did not say anything during the accident sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPassenger 1 stated that he may have passed out for a few minutes. When he regained consciousness, he realized he was out of his seatbelt (he did not recall unfastening the buckle). The helicopter had rolled on-to its left side, and he tried to find the door. When he tried to stand up, he realized he couldn't feel his legs. At this point, Passenger 2 had opened the right door and was climbing out. Although water was entering the cabin, he and the passenger who seated in the front left seat (Passenger 3) were able to keep their heads above water. There was no movement or response from the pilot. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPassenger 1 said that he remained where he was for a few minutes, and when the helicopter began to roll inverted, he was able to push himself out of the right rear door. He then tried to inflate his life vest, but when he pulled on the inflation-lanyard it would not inflate. He said that he was not familiar with this particular model vest and he did not try to self-inflate. Shortly after, Passenger 3 was able to get out of the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPassenger 1 said that while the deckhands were working to extract the pilot, Passenger 2 was dragged to a life-boat via a life-ring.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt this time, Passenger 1 saw a life vest floating in the water. He was able to inflate it and used it to support himself until he was rescued. Passenger 1 said that he was in a \" panic state of mind \" and did not recall getting onto the boat. He said the platform was not venting methane at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a telephone interview, Passenger 2 said that once the helicopter landed, he placed his bags in the cargo bay and walked around the front of the helicopter. He boarded the helicopter and said in the right rear seat, facing forward. He donned the provided inflatable life vest, a headset, and fastened his seatbelt assembly. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe said he did not talk to the pilot or notice anything unusual about his behavior. After all three passengers were onboard, the pilot asked if they were ready to go and they responded they were ready. The employee said the pilot then simultaneously brought the helicopter up off the pad and forward. He described the takeoff as \"kind of shaky.\" He said that on other flights, pilots will normally bring the helicopter into a hover, do an instrument check, and then start forward flight. However, in the three times he had flown with the accident pilot, he always took off without hovering.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPassenger 2 said that once the helicopter moved off the helipad and over the water, there was a \" winding noise \" then a \" pop \" sound.  His first instinct was that there was a problem with the transmission.  He did not hear alarms going off in the cockpit or see any annunciator lights. The helicopter then nosed over at an angle toward the water. Passenger 2 said that as the helicopter descended, the emergency floats expanded just before they hit the water. He then heard moans of pain coming from the other men onboard and that water started to enter the cabin. The helicopter had rolled on to its left side. He then undid his seatbelt and opened the right cabin door. Passenger 2 said he turned left and asked the passenger next to him if he was okay, and he responded that he could not feel his legs. Passenger 2 said that Passenger 1 had come completely out of his seatbelt during the impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPassenger 2 exited the helicopter and held onto the helicopter skid because his life vest did not expand when he pulled the inflation-lanyard. He said the that the life vest on Passenger 1 also would not inflate but that the vest on passenger 3 did inflate. He was not sure if the pilot's life vest inflated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPassenger 2 said that he saw the lift-boat and told the rescuers there were three more people on board. He was able to get onto the life boat, where he laid down until help arrived. He reiterated several times that there was nothing mechanically wrong with the helicopter until they started to take off. He said the platform was not venting methane that morning and the wind was calm.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPassenger 3 stated that it was a normal crew change and the weather was clear with no wind. He did not notice anything unusual with the pilot, who made sure everyone had their seatbelts and life vests on before departure. Passenger 3 said that the pilot then brought the helicopter up into a hover, turned the nose about 90 degrees, and departed. As soon as the helicopter cleared the helipad, he heard a sound \"that wasn't normal.\" The pilot declared a mayday, popped the floats, and the helicopter dove straight in to the ocean. Passenger 3 said the helicopter came to rest upright but was tilted back with the tail down in the water. He remembered looking up and realizing he was alive. He then looked over at the pilot and asked him if he was okay. The pilot responded that he must have broken his back because he could not feel anything. Passenger 3 then tried to unbuckle the pilot's seatbelt. While he was doing this, he saw the lift-boat and people jumping into the water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the rescuers reached the helicopter, they told Passenger 3 that the helicopter was about to roll inverted and he needed to get out. He was instructed to unbuckle his seatbelt and inflate his life vest. Passenger 3 said that when he inflated his vest, he floated up in his seat and a rescuer pulled him out of the helicopter. After he was out, the helicopter rolled inverted to the right toward the pilot. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPassenger 3 said that the pilot saved their lives by expanding the emergency floats because it kept the helicopter from sinking. He said that he had flown with the pilot on four other occasions and he always seemed competent. Passenger 3 said the platform had a flare boom that extended out from the platform by about 50 feet and vented continuously, but he was not sure about the timing of any methane flares on the day of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn a telephone interview, one of the platform employees who had just been dropped off at the platform for the crew change, stated that he and the two other platform employees arrived at Panther Helicopter's facility in Belle Chasse, Louisiana, on the morning of the accident around 0600. He said when they were ready to board, he got in the front left seat, put on his life vest and fastened his seatbelt. The pilot made sure everyone was wearing their life vests and seatbelts before departure. While en route, the platform employee said he briefly spoke to the pilot and he did not notice anything unusual with his demeanor. He said the helicopter was operating fine and there were no indications of any problems.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe platform employee said that after a normal landing, he exited the helicopter, retrieved his bags from the cargo bay, and went downstairs into the platform housing where he had a quick changeover briefing with the departing-lead. Several minutes later, he heard the helicopter's engine spool up as it prepared to takeoff. Everything sounded normal until he heard a \" pop \" and a high-pitched whine followed by a low pitch whine as if the engine was spooling down. He described the noise as a turbine or compressor winding down. At that point, he knew something was wrong and ran outside where he saw the helicopter in the water on its right side and one passenger exiting the helicopter. He went back inside and called the Coast Guard, Panther Helicopters, and his senior management.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a SkyConnect tracking system. The last registered altitude of the helicopter was about 141 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a private pilot certificate with an airplane single-engine land rating and a commercial pilot certificate for rotorcraft-helicopter.  His last Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second class medical was issued on January 10, 2013. According to the operator, the pilot had accrued a total of 3,450 total hours; of which 3,423 hours were in helicopters, and 177 hours were in the same make/model as the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was hired by Panther on June 17, 2013. His training was conducted by Panther in the Bell 206 helicopter. The pilot successfully completed his 14 CFR Part 135.293 and 135.299 FAA check-ride on July 25, 2013.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter was a 1991 Bell 206L-3 with serial number 51466. The single-engine helicopter was powered by an Allison M250-C30P turbo-shaft engine with serial number CAE 895524, which drove a two-bladed main rotor system and a two-bladed tail rotor. The engine had accrued a total of 10,670.8 hours at the time of the accident. The helicopter was configured to carry one pilot and six passengers. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the helicopter was maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's continuous inspection program. The helicopter's last inspection (event 2) was completed on October 3, 2013. The helicopter's total time at the time of the accident was 11,238 hours.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0600, weather conditions at the Belle Chasse heliport, Belle Chasse, Louisiana, about 72 nautical miles northwest of the accident site were calm wind, visibility 10 miles and clear skies, with a temperature of  65 degrees F.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0655, weather conditions at New Orleans Naval Air Station, Louisiana, about 72 miles northwest of the accident site, were calm winds, visibility 10 statute miles with shallow fog, few clouds at 5,000 feet, temperature 57 degrees  F, dew point  60 degrees F, and altimeter 30.06 inches of Mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHELIPAD INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), who has regulatory oversight of offshore operations, the Gulf of Mexico is divided into three primary subdivisions: Western Gulf of Mexico, Central Gulf of Mexico, and Eastern Gulf of Mexico. The three subdivisions are further divided into areas and blocks.  The blocks are about 3 miles long and 3 miles wide and are used for oil/gas lease identification. There are over 2,600 offshore production platforms in the Gulf of Mexico region.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe MP 107 D facility (BSEE Complex ID Number 2201) is a fixed, five slot, manned platform located approximately 17 miles off the coast of Louisiana in 61 feet of water. This facility, which was installed in July 2008, and was initially operated by LLOG Exploration Offshore, Inc.,was being operated by Energy XXI GOM, LLC (Energy XXI) at the time of the accident. MP107D features a single helideck (35-feet-long and 35-feet-wide).  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered and moved to Panther's maintenance facility in Belle Chasse, Louisiana. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Investigator-in-Charge conducted an examination of the airframe and a visual examination of the engine on October 14, 2013. Also present for the examination were representatives of Panther, Rolls Royce, and Bell Helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was secured and upright on a flatbed trailer. The engine, transmission, and main rotor system remained attached to the airframe. One of the main rotor blades had been cut off for transport and the other blade was fractured during the impact with the water. The section of fractured blade was never located. The tail boom had separated from the fuselage about 12 -inches aft of the tail boom attachment point. The tail rotor assembly had separated aft of the elevator and was never recovered. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe entire windshield on the right side of the helicopter was missing, and a large section of windshield was missing on the left side. The forward and aft passenger doors were removed. The aft cargo bay was crushed upward from the bottom of the fuselage. Salt water corrosion was noted throughout the fuselage and engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was confirmed for the cyclic and the collective to the main rotor system.  Partial flight control continuity was established for the anti-torque pedals from the cockpit to the point where the tail boom had separated from the fuselage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe throttle was locked in the fuel-cutoff position, which was consistent with the setting on the fuel control unit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the pilot's four-point shoulder harness/seatbelt assembly revealed that it was secure at all fuselage attach points. The inertial reel was locked, and stretch marks on the belt material were observed in several locations. The latching mechanism functioned normally when manually tested.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe front seat passenger's four-point shoulder harness/seatbelt assembly was also secure at all fuselage attach points and functioned normally when manually tested.  The inertial reel was not locked.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe metal seatbox for the front passenger's seat was crushed downward.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll of the rear seat shoulder harness/seatbelt assemblies were secured at their respective fuselage attachment points and the latching mechanisms functioned normally when manually tested.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA visual examination of the engine revealed that it did not sustain much impact damage; however, several large holes were observed in the exhaust collector support stack.  A hole was also observed in the cowling on the right side near the area of the support stack. Oil was in the bottom of the engine pan and the forward engine mounts were slightly bent. All engine fuel, oil and pneumatic lines, and b-nut fittings were tight and no leaks were observed. No damage was noted with the transmission.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was removed and shipped to Rolls Royce, where a tear down examination was conducted on November 6-7, 2013, under the supervision of an NTSB investigator. Representatives of the FAA, Rolls Royce, Panther and Bell Helicopter were also present for the examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe centrifugal compressor section was disassembled. The #1 and #2 bearings were examined and found to be free of any indications of distress. The compressor impellor vanes exhibited slight indications of rotational rubbing; however, no other indications of foreign object ingestion or other damage were noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe gearbox was disassembled. Examination of internal components did not reveal any obvious defects to the gearing. The inside of the gearbox contained a large quantity of the magnesium casing, corrosion deposits and material from the effects of sea water immersion and recovery operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe gas generator turbine and power turbine sections were disassembled. The first stage turbine nozzle and disk were undamaged. The second stage turbine disk blades all exhibited tip rub.  Several of the blades had hard impact damage and were missing material along the trailing edge. One blade separated near the blade root. All of the third stage turbine disk blades were liberated at the blade roots. All of the fourth stage turbine disk blades were damaged, with about 320 degrees of the blade shrouds detached. The blades did not breach the turbine cases.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWith the approval of the NTSB, metallurgical testing was conducted by the Rolls Royce Failure Analysis laboratory (Indianapolis, Indiana), to further determine the cause of the second stage turbine blade failure. The examination revealed no material anomalies and that the blade failed in high cycle fatigue (HCF) from the trailing edge area 0.300- inch outboard of the wheel rim. Facets covered the origin area up to 0.054- inch from the trailing edge with the final failure being in overload when it separated from the turbine disk.  When the second stage blade failed, it subsequently damaged the third stage turbine blades and, in turn, the fourth stage turbine blades were also damaged. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Rolls Royce, there were no previous reports of the second stage turbine blades failing in HCF at a similar spanwise location. As a result, Rolls Royce conducted an updated dynamics analysis of the second stage turbine wheel.  The results revealed, \"…no mode crossing within or above the normal engine operating range (between ground idle and up to 115% speed) that would be consistent with HCF initiation at the observed location of the subject turbine wheel.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree other potential failure scenarios were also evaluated that could have possibly been attributed to HCF of the second stage turbine blade: 1) normal operation resulting in tip rub, 2) distorted blade geometry as a result of foreign object debris (FOD) sufficient to change the dynamic characteristics of individual blades resulting in a crossing within the normal operating range, and 3) abnormal operation resulting in a combination of one or more of the following: tip rub, an undetermined blade natural frequency being excited, and atypical aerodynamic loading.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe intact second stage turbine blades sustained damage from the blade liberation; tip rub was identified on the leading edge portion of almost every blade tip but not on the trailing edge portion of the blade.  Due to a lack of uniform rubbing signatures, it could not be determined if the tip rub observed on the blades existed before the blade separated. According to Rolls Royce, previous fatigue fractures on the turbine blades due to tip rub initiated at the trailing edge close to the turbine wheel rim rather than outboard of the rim. The liberated blade HCF crack/overload was similar to other failures, but the spanwise position where it separated was unique.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no FOD- related damaged identified, so it is unlikely that ingestion of debris contributed to the blade failure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe final failure mode due to abnormal operation (NG over-speed, compressor stall, and distortion), could result in tip rub and/or in aerodynamic conditions that could cause atypical loading on the blade. According to the operator, there were no reports of excessive engine vibration, compressor stall, or engine surges reported before the accident. The engine was not equipped with an engine-monitoring system that could have identified any engine anomalies that may have contributed to the blade failure and subsequent loss of engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, MP107D was an active oil production platform. One of the natural by-products of oil production is methane, an odorless and colorless gas, which is automatically released into the atmosphere via a boom that extends away from the platform. Venting can occur for several reasons, including temporary equipment upsets or the continuous release of gas in an amount that is too small to economically capture and sell. In the past, the NTSB has determined that ingestion of methane gas while operating at offshore oil platforms has caused compressor stalls and either a partial or total loss of engine power on turbine engine-equipped helicopters. Since MP107D was an active platform at the time of the accident, the NTSB asked the BSEE to investigate venting around the time of the accident. According to the BSEE, MP107D was a low-production platform that produced less than 2,000 barrels per day and was not required by federal law to meter the volume of gas being vented. Based on records provided by the platform operator, there were no equipment upsets on the day of the accident. Therefore, any methane venting would have been limited to the gas continuously being released or flashed off the condensate during production. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSince MP107D was not federally mandated to meter the volume of methane being released, there was no way to determine the exact volume of methane released at the time of the accident. However, records provided by the platform operator, indicate an estimated 22 million cubic feet per day (MCFPD) was vented on October 9, 2013. BSEE conducted its own independent estimation using the most recent fluid analysis data provided by the operator, which was taken about 6 to 7 months before the accident. According to BSEE, \" ...analysis indicates that approximately 49 MCFPD was vented from the MP107D facility on October 9, 2013.  The operator's field records indicate a lower, but not unreasonable, vent volume estimate of 22 MCF that day.  Based on the volume vented that day and the reason for venting, it appears that specific BSEE approval for this venting was not required under federal regulations. \" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough two of the surviving crewmembers stated that the platform was not venting methane at the time of the accident and an eyewitness said he did not see methane being vented (as he had seen previously at MP107D), platform operating records revealed that methane was being vented continuously on the day of the accident. However, the actual volume released at the time of the accident could not be determined. It could also not be determined whether the methane was ingested into the engine on takeoff.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing was conducted by the FAA Toxicology and Accident Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The pilot tested positive for Cetirizine (a sedating antihistamine) in his blood and urine. Diphenhydramine, also a sedating antihistamine, was detected in his urine and blood (.024ug/ml, ug/g). In addition, Ibuprofen was detected in the pilot's urine. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot reported that he was maneuvering the helicopter into position near a 150-foot-tall power transmission line tower to prepare to attach a line to a rope and pull it through a traveler for power line construction. The wind had increased and was gusting, and the main rotor blades struck the tower. The helicopter spun around, and the tail rotor subsequently struck the tower. The tail rotor and tail rotor gearbox separated from the helicopter as it descended to the ground. A postcrash fire consumed the wreckage. The pilot did not report any mechanical malfunctions or failures with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation. It is likely that the gusting wind conditions negatively affected the pilot's ability to maintain sufficient clearance from the tower while maneuvering into position.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On October 6, 2013, at 1217 central daylight time, a McDonnell Douglas 369FF, N530KF, collided with a power transmission line tower while maneuvering to pick up a rope for the external load operation. The commercial pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Rogers Aviation under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 133. The helicopter was substantially damaged. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time and no flight plan was filed. The flight originated from a local area staging site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was maneuvering the helicopter near a 150 foot tall power transmission line tower in preparation to attach a line to a rope to pull it through a traveller for power line construction. Ground crew, whose boom truck was positioned near the base of the tower, reported that the boom truck basket was positioned at the bottom traveler about 100 feet above ground level. The rope had been threaded through the top traveler. As the helicopter was maneuvering into position to pick up the rope, the wind had picked up and become gusty. As the pilot was maneuvering the helicopter, the main rotor blades struck the tower and the top traveler located about 140 feet above ground level. The helicopter spun around and the tail rotor struck the tower. The tail rotor and tail rotor gearbox separated from the helicopter as it descended rapidly to the ground near the base of the tower. A postcrash fire consumed the wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 34 year old pilot held flight certificates for commercial rotorcraft with an instrument rating, and a certified flight instructor for rotorcraft/instrument rotorcraft. The pilot held a class II Federal Aviation Administration medical certificate issued on July 10, 2013, with no waivers/limitations. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot began employment with Rogers Aviation on July 8, 2013. At this time, the pilot reported a total flight time of 4,550 hours. A 14 CFR Part 133 check ride was passed and the pilot had been flying external load and power line operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter, model 369FF, was manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company in 1994, and was equipped with a Rolls-Royce C30 turbo shaft engine. As of the last 100 hour inspection, which was completed on October 1, 2013, the helicopter had accumulated 7,157 total flight hours. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a side-pull kit with a 30 foot line attached to the left side of the machine. The helicopter had just been refueled with 60 gallons of fuel in the main tank and 20 gallons in the auxiliary tank. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe nearest weather reporting facility was located 31 nautical miles north of the accident site at Childress Municipal airport, Childress, Texas. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe surface weather at 1153 reported wind from 350 degrees at 13 knots, gusting to 17 knots. The sky was clear and visibility was 10 statute miles. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1253, the wind was from 330 degrees at 10 knots, gusting to 18 knots. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on its left side at the base of the 150 foot power pole tower. A postcrash fire consumed the cabin area forward of the aft passenger bulkhead. The tail rotor gear box was located between the tower and the boom truck. The tail rotor was found several yards south of the gear box.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no report of a preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was performed on the pilot by South Plains Forensic Pathology; P.A. The cause of death was attributed to blunt force injuries of the torso with smoke and soot inhalation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSamples for toxicology were sent to the Federal Aviation Administration Civil Aeromedical Institute, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for analysis. The report stated 24% carbon monoxide was detected in the blood. Additional tests for cyanide, ethanol, and tested for drugs were negative. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot/owner had just taken control of the helicopter from another pilot. As the relieved pilot was walking away from the helicopter and between the 10- and 11-o'clock position forward of the helicopter, he came into contact with a rotating main rotor blade. The pilot/owner stated that, when exiting the helicopter, it was the company's practice to disengage the rotor drive system and secure the collective control. In this condition, the rotor blades droop below the normal height, and the drooping is most pronounced in the 9- to 12-o'clock position of the rotor disk. According to the helicopter manufacturer representative, the main rotor height can vary depending on how the helicopter landing gear was serviced. In addition, depending on the position of the cyclic, the main rotor can descend lower than 6 feet when the main rotor is operating. It is likely that the pilot/owner unintentionally moved the cyclic, which resulted in the rotor blade descending, and, in combination with the rotor droop, the main rotor blade would have been low enough to strike the relieved pilot's head.",
    "FactualNarrative": "On September 27, 2013, at 1938 eastern daylight time, an Estrom F-28C, N631DP, received minor damage when a relieved pilot, who was walking from the helicopter, was fatally injured after coming into contact with a rotating main rotor blade, near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania. The airline transport pilot, seated at the controls in the helicopter, was the sole occupant and was not injured. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Heritage Rotors, LLC, under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a local sightseeing flight at a local fair. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed. The flight was originating at the time of the accident. According to the pilot/owner's written statement in the NTSB Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident/Incident Report, he \"approached the left side of the helicopter and rested on the seat and looked into the helicopter… [he] was looking down onto the pilot seat considering the location of the pilot seat belt, the headset, and the general condition of the interior. At this point, nothing in the cockpit was touched and was exactly as [the relieved pilot] had left it. It was at this moment that [the pilot] heard a 'thud.'\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to local law enforcement personnel, the pilot/owner seated in the left front seat of the helicopter had just taken over from the pilot who was walking away from the helicopter when the accident occurred. The pilot in the helicopter stated to local law enforcement immediately after the accident that he saw the previous pilot walking away, thought he had walked beyond the main rotor blades, and looked down to fasten his seatbelt. While he was fastening his seatbelt, he heard the main rotor blades strike something, looked up, and saw the relieved pilot on the ground. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe local law enforcement report stated that the relieved pilot was located between the 10 and 11 o'clock position forward of the helicopter. In addition, the helipad was located in a level, grassy area near the entrance to the fair grounds. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration records, the relieved pilot held a commercial pilot certificate for airplane single-engine and multiengine land, airplane single-engine sea, instrument airplane and helicopter, glider, and rotorcraft helicopter. He reported on his last insurance application that he accumulated 3,900 hours of total flight time, of which, 600 hours were in the same make and model as the accident helicopter. His most recent second-class medical certificate was issued in December 2012. At that time, the pilot reported a height of 71 inches. According to the helicopter flight manual, the main rotor could droop to a minimum height of 72 inches. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA records, the helicopter was manufactured in 1980 and registered to the operator in 2010. According to the pilot/owner, the most recent annual inspection was performed on July 2, 2013. At the time of the accident, the helicopter had accumulated 2198 hours of total flight time. According to the helicopter manufacturer training guide, the helicopter was equipped with a crew compartment that consisted of \"pilot and passenger/co-pilot seating, instrument panel, radio console, and pilot and co-pilot flight controls mounted to the aluminum floor structure and enclosed in the fiberglass cabin shell. The co-pilot controls are removable and a seat cushion for the third passenger is inserted into the space vacated when the co-pilot collective is removed.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot/owner, reported that there were no mechanical anomalies or malfunctions with the helicopter that would have precluded normal operation prior to the accident. He further reported that he and the relieved pilot both \"conducted every aspect of [the] operation purposely for our safety and that of our patrons and neighbors.\" In addition, he stated that when exiting the helicopter, it is the company's practice to \"disengage the rotor drive system and secure the collective control by means of the friction lock…In this condition, the rotor blades 'droop' below the normal height. This drooping is non-symmetrical and most pronounced in the 9 – 12 o'clock position of the rotor [disk].\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the Operator/Owner Recommendation section of the NTSB Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident/Incident Report, the pilot/owner stated that he \"cannot conceive why [the relieved pilot] would knowingly approach the aircraft in a position he knew well to be the lowest point of the rotor system. This was not our practice and absolutely not his habit.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe weather conditions reported at an airport about 26 nautical miles northwest of the accident location around the time of the accident included calm wind. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter manufacturer representative, the main rotor height can vary depending on how the helicopter landing gear was serviced. In addition, depending on the position of the cyclic, the main rotor can descend lower than six feet when the main rotor is operating. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook, \"The cyclic pitch control is usually projected upward from the cockpit floor, between the pilot's legs or between the two pilot seats in some models. This primary flight control allows the pilot to fly the helicopter in any direction of travel: forward, rearward, left, and right…The purpose of the cyclic pitch control is to tilt the tip-path plane in the direction of the desired horizontal direction. The cyclic controls the rotor disk tilt versus the horizon, which directs the rotor disk thrust to enable the pilot to control the direction of travel of the helicopter. The rotor disk tilts in the same direction the cyclic pitch control is moved. If the cyclic is moved forward, the rotor disk tilts forward; if the cyclic is moved aft, the disk tilts aft, and so on.\" -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "About 5 months before the accident, the pilot purchased the former military helicopter, which he was operating as an experimental aircraft in the exhibition category, and had flown it about 33 hours. On the day of the accident, during cruise flight, about 2,000 ft above ground level, the main rotor (MR) mast failed, and the MR hub and blade assembly separated from the helicopter. The primary debris trail was relatively linear and extended a distance of about 2,000 ft. Examination of the recovered wreckage revealed that five components of one MR blade's pitch control system, including a rotary damper assembly, were missing. Several subsequent searches of the accident site were unsuccessful in locating the missing components. The inability to locate these five components, combined with the damage patterns on neighboring components that were recovered, suggested that the components' separation was the precipitating event in the accident sequence. It is likely that one or more of the missing components either failed or otherwise became detached, which resulted in a loss of MR blade pitch control, mast bumping, and mast failure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor most of the 9 years before its purchase, the helicopter had been on display in a museum and was flown infrequently. After acquiring the helicopter, the pilot contacted several people who were knowledgeable about this make and model helicopter to solicit maintenance advice and/or services. Interviews of these people and review of available records indicated that the pilot, who was not an FAA-certificated aircraft mechanic, conducted a majority of the maintenance activity on the helicopter. The pilot purchased multiple used components of unknown airworthiness and at least one of these components, a rotary damper assembly, was installed on the MR blade pitch control system by the pilot about 2 months before the accident. However, incomplete component purchase and aircraft maintenance records prevented the investigation from determining whether that damper was still installed on the day of the accident and exactly what maintenance the pilot had performed on the MR blade pitch control system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's limited maintenance qualifications and experience decreased the likelihood that he would detect nonairworthy conditions or components and increased the risk of improper repairs. It is likely that the inflight separation of the MR hub and blade assembly was precipitated by the pilot's improper maintenance actions on the MR blade pitch control system.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHTOn September 21, 2013, about 1150 mountain standard time, a Bell UH-1V helicopter, N22490, was destroyed when it impacted the ground near Cordes Lakes, Arizona, following the in-flight separation of the main rotor hub and blade assembly. The owner/pilot and the non-pilot rated passenger were fatally injured. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight plan was filed for the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was based at Scottsdale airport (SDL), Scottsdale, Arizona, and reportedly departed SDL the morning of the accident. According to witnesses, the helicopter landed at Sedona airport (SEZ), Sedona, Arizona, that morning, where a fly-in and aircraft exhibition event was being held. SEZ was located approximately 75 nautical miles (nm) north of SDL. The pilot and passenger re-boarded the helicopter about 2 hours later, and departed SEZ. On departure, the helicopter first air-taxied along runway 3, which was approximately downwind, about 100 feet above ground level. It was then observed to make a course reversal near the end of the runway, and flew along runway 21 before departing the area. A short time later, eyewitnesses who were located about 30 miles south-southwest of SEZ observed the airborne helicopter \"explode\" near them, and telephoned 911 to report the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA partial radar track associated with the helicopter indicated that the first target was acquired about 1138, at an indicated altitude of 6,500 feet. That target was located about 12 miles from SEZ, on a magnetic bearing of 197 degrees. The last radar target associated with the helicopter was recorded about 1150, at an indicated altitude of 5,700 feet. That final target was approximately coincident with the wreckage location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was distributed for a distance of about 1/2 mile along the flight path. FAA and Honeywell personnel responded to the accident site on the afternoon of the accident, and began mapping the debris field. The following day the NTSB investigator arrived, the team completed the on-scene mapping and examination, and the wreckage was recovered to a secure facility for detailed examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a private pilot certificate with airplane single- and multi-engine land ratings, and was issued a rotorcraft helicopter rating in May 2013. On his most recent application for an FAA medical certificate, the pilot reported that he had 1,856 total hours of flight experience. His helicopter flight training and flight examination were conducted in a Hughes 269 helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPortions of the pilot's flight log were recovered in the wreckage, and partially-completed helicopter flight logs were recovered from the pilot's hangar. Review of the available records indicated that the pilot had purchased the helicopter in Texas in April 2013. He reportedly received 1 to 2 hours of instruction in the helicopter while it was in Texas, but this was not able to be confirmed by the investigation. The pilot then flew the helicopter to his home base in Arizona, in a trip that consisted of 7 legs and 9.6 flight hours. On that trip, the pilot was accompanied by a rotorcraft instructor who had no prior experience in the UH-1 or any of its variants.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the period between the delivery trip and early May, 2013, the pilot conducted 5 flights in the helicopter with two other, different instructors, one of whom was his flight examiner for his rotorcraft rating. Those flights had a total duration of 8.3 hours. The records indicated that subsequent to that, the pilot completed 12 additional flights, with a total duration of 13.4 hours, in the helicopter but without an instructor. Several of the flight entries did not have dates associated with them. The last dated flight entry in the helicopter was for a flight on August 4, 2013. That entry was followed by two undated ones for two more flights, the last of which was to Payson, Arizona. The last entry that was dated in the pilot's flight log was for a flight on August 15. The duration was 1.0 hours, but the flight location/destination was indecipherable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's helicopter flight examiner stated that the pilot had purchased the UH-1 prior to his completion of his helicopter rating. The examiner estimated that the pilot had less than 100 hours of helicopter flight experience at the time of the accident. Compilation of all available records indicated that the pilot had a total flight experience of about 33 hour in the accident helicopter make and model.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Yavapai County (Arizona) Office of the Medical Examiner (ME) autopsy report cited multiple blunt force trauma as the cause of death. The report cited a toxicology finding for ethanol of 1.470 mg/g, which is a weight per unit weight parameter. The laboratory that conducted the toxicology determination was located in Indiana. The investigation was unable to determine how the samples were packed, how long they were in transit, and under what temperature conditions; without such information the possibility of putrefaction, and resultant ethanol production, could not be quantified. Except for caffeine and nicotine, all other Yavapai County ME toxicology findings were negative.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) conducted forensic toxicology examinations on specimens from the pilot, and reported that no carbon monoxide, cyanide, ethanol, or any screened drugs were detected. The CAMI cutoff level for ethanol was 10 mg/dL, which is a weight per unit volume parameter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was manufactured in 1974. It was equipped with a Lycoming/Honeywell T-53 series turboshaft engine, and was originally delivered to the United States (US) Army. The helicopter was equipped with a two-blade teetering main rotor (MR) system, and a two-blade tail rotor (TR) system. For reference and maintenance purposes, the two blades and their control components in each rotor system were differentiated by arbitrarily assigning them color names, in this case \"Red\" and \"White;\" both the MR and TR systems each had one Red and one White blade.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn 2001, the helicopter was transferred to the civil registry as surplus equipment, to a non-profit agency in Texas. In 2004, the helicopter was transferred to the Marine Aviation Museum in Texas, and was sold to JR Helicopter in 2012, which sold it to the accident pilot in April 2013.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Bell records, the helicopter was delivered as a UH-1H. The US Army converted it to a medical configuration, UH-1V. At some point the helicopter was again modified, back to a UH-1H configuration, but the civil registry did not reflect that; it remained registered as a UH-1V. In March 2013, JR Helicopter unsuccessfully requested that the FAA alter the registration to designate it as a UH-1H model.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 6, 2013, the pilot submitted his application to the FAA for the special airworthiness certificate. The FAA registered the helicopter to the pilot in the \"Experimental\" class, \"Exhibition\" category in July 2013. FAA representatives at the Scottsdale, Arizona Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) reported that the Phase II limitations issued by the Houston FSDO on March 28, 2013, remained in effect after the transfer of ownership to the accident pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the maintenance records that were obtained by the investigation indicated that that the most recent annual condition inspection was completed on April 20, 2013. That inspection was signed off by the seller of the helicopter, and stated that the helicopter was in \"a safe operational condition for continued use.\" The records indicated that at the time of that inspection, the helicopter had a total time in service of just over 3,664 hours. The most recent airworthiness directive (AD) compliance list for the helicopter was dated December 26, 2006, but that list was annotated to indicate that it was re-validated on December 22, 2008.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of recovered flight log and maintenance records indicated that the helicopter had accumulated approximately 3,693 hours total time in service at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe SEZ 1135 automated weather observation included winds from 230 degrees at 5 knots, gusting to 17 knots, visibility 10 miles, with clear skies. Review of available meteorological information indicated that winds aloft in the general vicinity of the accident location were from 210 degrees at 15 knots at 6,000 feet, and 220 degrees at 18 knots for 7,000 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter debris trail was oriented along a magnetic track of about 160 degrees. The distance between the northernmost (earliest) and southernmost (last) items in the debris field was about 3,200 feet. However, the northernmost items were light, low-density, and high-drag items, which were more readily influenced by winds. The distance from the northernmost wreckage item not readily influenced by the wind to the southern end of the debris field was about 2,000 feet. The majority of the debris was arrayed in highly linear fashion, but the main rotor assembly, which included the two blades and the hub, was located about 600 feet east of the debris trail.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe debris trail included the cockpit windshields and doors, cabin sidewall, and cabin interior items. The majority of the helicopter, including the cockpit/cabin, engine, transmission, tail boom, and tail rotor assembly, was located in or near an impact crater at the southern end of the debris trail. No evidence of any pre-impact failures of the engine, reduction gearbox, transmission, or tail rotor drive assemblies was observed. No evidence of fire or a high-order explosion was observed on any components found in the debris trail, and the only evidence of fire was observed in and around the main impact crater.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe initial on-scene and post recovery examinations of the wreckage resulted in the following observations:&#x0D;\n-\tThe MR hub and blade assembly separated as a unit from the helicopter&#x0D;\n-\tThe location of the MR hub and blade assembly, about 600 feet east of the north-south main debris trail, was consistent with an early event in the accident sequence&#x0D;\n-\tThe location of the MR hub and blade assembly was consistent with the assembly having sufficient rotational energy to 'fly' in a non-ballistic path that diverged significantly from the helicopter's flight path&#x0D;\n-\tThe damage patterns to the MR hub and blade assembly and the rest of the helicopter were consistent with one or both of the MR blades cutting into the cockpit and cabin&#x0D;\n-\tThe damage patterns were consistent with the right cockpit/cabin sidewall and right landing skid being sheared from the helicopter in a plane oriented approximately parallel to the helicopter's longitudinal and vertical axes, from front to back.&#x0D;\n-\tFive components of the MR \"White\" blade control system were not located; these included the pitch horn, pitch change link, stabilizer bar mixing lever, rotary damper assembly, and the pitch control tube normally situated between the scissor links and the stabilizer bar assembly.&#x0D;\n-\tThe damage patterns were consistent with the missing White components being liberated by overload forces while the MR hub and blade assembly was rotating&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe MR hub and blade assembly, with the MR blade grips and most of the MR blade leading edge spars attached, separated via a rotor mast fracture at the base of the hub. At the mast fracture location, the circular cross section of the mast was deformed to an oval. The mast fracture was consistent with overload, and no evidence of pre-existing problems such as corrosion or fatigue, was observed. Above the fracture, the mast exhibited evidence of hard contact with the aluminum main rotor hub static stops. The static stops exhibited corresponding contact witness marks and deformation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hub moment spring support assembly remained attached to the bottom of the MR yoke, but the hub springs (elastic bumpers) were not installed. The stabilizer bar assembly was found separated from the MR hub and blade assembly. The White side stabilizer support remained attached to the White center frame of the stabilizer bar assembly. The White stabilizer support was fracture-separated from the White side trunnion, and all four support attach bolt fractures were consistent with shear and bending overload forces.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom was fracture-separated from the fuselage, consistent with overload, and was located adjacent to the main wreckage. The TR drive shaft and housing along the top of the tailboom did not exhibit any non-impact-related distress. No evidence of any pre-impact anomalies in the TR system was observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was found in the main wreckage crater, but was located outside of the fire-affected area; the engine was found separated from the fuselage mounts. Engine damage signatures, including blade deformation, and metal spattering and accretions, were consistent with rotation under power at the time of impact. No evidence of any pre-impact engine anomalies was observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSubsequent to the initial recovery efforts, two additional dedicated search efforts were conducted in attempts to locate the missing components from the White MR blade control system. Although both of those searches located additional debris, the noted White MR blade control system components were never located.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRefer to the NTSB public docket for this accident for additional information.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain Rotor Hub Moment Spring&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn the mid 1980's the United States Army, in conjunction with Bell Helicopter, developed and installed a \"hub moment spring kit\" on US Army UH-1 helicopters. According to Army maintenance guidance document TM-55-1520-210-10, the hub moment spring also provided \"an additional margin of safety in the event of an inadvertent excursion of the helicopter beyond the approved flight envelope.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 1, 2002, the FAA issued AD 2002-01-31, which affected multiple models of the Bell UH-1, 204 and 205 helicopters \"with main rotor mast (mast), part number (P/N) 204-011-450-007... or main rotor trunnion (trunnion), P/N 204-011-105-001 installed, certificated in any category.\" Review of the maintenance records indicated that both the main rotor mast and main rotor trunnion part numbers specified by the AD were installed on the accident helicopter. Among other actions, the AD required, within 25 hours time in service, the removal of \"any hub spring installed on any affected helicopter\" which were \"intended to prevent failure of a mast or trunnion, separation of the main rotor system, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the helicopter's most recent AD compliance list indicated that the AD had been complied with, which was contrary to the physical evidence observed during the wreckage examination. The hub springs (elastic bumpers) had been removed from the helicopter, but the hub spring support mount was still installed on the helicopter. The normal static stops limit the hub teeter (pivot) angle to a value less than that required to result in contact between the bumper-less spring mount and the mast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPost-Purchase Pilot Maintenance Inquiries&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSubsequent to his return to Arizona with the newly purchased helicopter, the pilot contacted several persons or agencies knowledgeable about UH-1 helicopters, with the apparent intent of soliciting maintenance advice and/or services.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 6, 2013, in response to a request from the pilot, the pilot's rotorcraft examiner physically examined the helicopter in detail. In a post-accident interview with the NTSB, he reported that the helicopter was in \"fairly decent shape\" when he examined it. The examiner noticed that one of the main rotor blade dampers was in need of repair/replacement, but stated that it appeared to be functional. He did not provide any observations regarding the visual appearance or clarity of the damper oil.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlso in early May, 2013, and in response to a request from the pilot, the president of a company called Helicopter Consulting (HC) briefly examined the helicopter. His findings were summarized in a May 7, 2013, letter to the pilot. The letter stated that although the maintenance records were not reviewed, a \"visual look\" at the helicopter revealed two obvious concerns; the laminated tail fin spar had not been replaced  with the single-piece spar per an Airworthiness Directive, and the helicopter had a \"bump kit\" (hub moment spring assembly) installed. The letter recommended the accomplishment of the fin spar AD, the removal of the bump kit, and the compilation and accomplishment of a complete AD list for the helicopter. The letter also noted that the pilot's contention that registration of the helicopter in the Experimental class precluded the need for the pilot to accomplish ADs was not in the \"interest of safety,\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn an October 23, 2013, interview with the NTSB, the HC president stated that he informed the pilot that the helicopter \"was unsafe to fly\" and that he (the president) \"wouldn't fly it.\" He also noted that the main rotor blade tension-torsion (\"TT\") straps calendar life limits (24 months) had been exceeded, that the engine service time and cycles had not been tracked, and therefore the engine was in an unknown compliance condition.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn August 2013, the pilot visited with Overseas Aircraft Support (OAS), which provided maintenance services for UH-1 helicopters, including some US Forest Service UH-1 helicopters. In that meeting, the pilot reportedly told the OAS representative that he recently experienced a \"mast bump event\" in the helicopter. In the same meeting, the OAS representative cautioned the pilot for not correcting a previously-discussed tail rotor vibration, and for incurring the mast bump event. The OAS representative never viewed the helicopter or its maintenance records.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe available records did not enable a complete and accurate determination of the maintenance status of the helicopter at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOthers' Perceptions of Pilot's Attitude&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt least two individuals who were interviewed by the NTSB after the accident offered observations and opinions about the pilot's attitude regarding operational and flight/mechanical safety. Both the pilot's helicopter flight examiner and the OAS representative offered unsolicited opinions that the pilot \"did not respect\" the helicopter, meaning that the pilot held the opinion that he was not obligated to comply with the maintenance and flight requirements and limitations. The examiner explained that the pilot was unwilling to acknowledge the peculiarities and/or necessary maintenance and flight procedures for the helicopter, and instead elected to operate and maintain the helicopter as he deemed appropriate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot owned several other aircraft, including a Nanchang CJ-6, an Aerovodochody L-39, and a Beech 200. He did not hold an FAA aircraft mechanic certificate. The examiner reported that the pilot told him that the \"Experimental\" registry of those airplanes, including the Beech, as well as the helicopter, enabled the pilot to maintain the aircraft himself, and thereby save money by reducing the need to pay for maintenance. The examiner advised the pilot that that approach was flawed logic and false economy, particularly because the helicopter required 3 to 4 hours of qualified maintenance per flight hour to ensure its and the pilot's safety.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's stated position to the President of HC that registry of aircraft in the Experimental class obviated the need to comply with ADs was consistent with an attitude of reduced concern about aircraft airworthiness.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nComponent and Maintenance Activities (Pilot)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMultiple telephone conversations, email exchanges, and forwarded emails from a parts provider in Pennsylvania provided some information regarding the pilot's efforts to locate parts for the helicopter. The parts provider sold used and some new components. He stated to both the pilot and the investigation that all components were sold \"as is,\" and that he made no representation of any component's airworthiness. The parts provider indicated that the pilot had purchased multiple items from him, including a main rotor mast and dampers. The parts provider sometimes sold components in \"batches\" or \"lots,\" and he did not typically track the part or serial numbers of any of the items that he sold.  Therefore the investigation was unable to determine what specific parts the pilot purchased from this provider.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA July 25, 2013, email from the pilot to the parts provider stated that \"I even had to refill the damper I got from you as it sat for so long the fluid was half gone :)! we will see how it works when I fire it up this weekend.\" Although this communication makes it clear that the pilot had replaced at least one MR damper, the sparsity of the pilot's maintenance records, combined with the parts provider's lack of detailed sales records, prevented the investigation from determining the maintenance or service history of most components on the helicopter. In addition, the lack of part number accountability prevented the investigation from determining whether any of those components remained with or separated from the helicopter during the breakup sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Ground Tracking Radar Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the pilot did not contact FAA air traffic control (ATC) for services, and ATC was not actively tracking the flight, a portion of the accident flight was captured by three separate ARSR-4 radar facilities, all located in Arizona. Review of the track data resulted in the use of the data from the \"PHX\" facility, which provided the longest and most continuous coverage. The radar sweep rate was 5 rpm, for a radar return interval of 12 seconds. A total of 58 radar returns from the helicopter were obtained by the PHX facility, during the period from 1138:47 to 1150:10.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe track began about 13 miles south-southwest of SEZ, and measured about 17 miles long. The track overlaid the debris path and main wreckage site, but terminated about 300 feet south of (beyond) the main wreckage impact location. This apparent discrepancy was attributed to the resolution uncertainties of the radar system target location data. The transponder-reported altitude varied irregularly between about 6,500 and 7,100 feet. The radar altitude trace was not consistent with any terrain-following maneuvering. The groundspeeds derived from the radar data indicated that the groundspeed averaged about 90 knots, with irregular variations of plus and minus about 5 knots; those values were consistent with the normal flight regime of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMast Bumping Scenarios&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe teetering-rotor design made the helicopter susceptible to a phenomenon known as \"mast-bumping,\" where, under certain circumstances, the rotor hub could pivot to the point where the hub static stop(s) contact the rotor mast. In-flight mast bumping can impart loads beyond the mast's structural limit, resulting in mast failure, separation of the MR blade system, and loss of the helicopter. Potential initiators for mast bumping include pilot inputs and mechanical failure. The MR mast failure was consistent with a mast-bumping event, but the evidence was insufficient to determine the initiating event for the mast bump.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor the pilot-input scenario, the system was most susceptible to mast bumping when the helicopter g-loading was 0.5 or less, and significant or aggressive cyclic control inputs were made. The combination of low-g loading and aggressive cyclic inputs can be encountered in low altitude, terrain-following flight, particularly when the helicopter crests a hill, and the pilot then attempts to follow the descending terrain by rapidly descending the helicopter. The available radar data was not consistent with the helicopter conducting terrain-following flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor the mechanical failure scenario, if the pitch of one MR blade can no longer be regulated by the flight control system due to the physical decoupling of the flight controls, the resulting blade flap, due to the free-flying blade and asymmetric lift between the two blades,, can result in mast bumping. Decoupling of the pitch control can occur for several reasons, including:&#x0D;\n-\tThe direct mechanical failure of a component in the MR blade pitch link system&#x0D;\n-\tThe failure or loss of MR blade pitch control link attach hardware between the rotating swashplate and the main rotor grip, resulting in loss of pitch control system joint integrity&#x0D;\n-\tThe failure or separation of another component in the rotating MR hub and blade assembly, such as a damper, which then damages and fails the pitch control linkage as a result of flailing and/or  impact due to rotary motion and centrifugal force -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "Witnesses reported that, when the helicopter was just above the trees during an external load logging operation, they either observed or heard the load of logs release early and impact the ground hard. Witnesses then observed the helicopter's tailboom separate from the fuselage and descend through the trees. The fuselage impacted the ground inverted, and the tailboom came to rest about 140 ft away. A mechanic reported that the pilot had indicated before the flight that the helicopter felt like it \"shuffled\" during translational lift; however, the mechanic suspected that the transmission mounts were starting to wear and would need to be changed at a later date. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed control continuity throughout the airframe except for a portion of the tail rotor drive shaft that extended from the transmission, which was not found. The tailboom had separated from the aft fuselage at the tailboom attachment points. The lower two tailboom attachment fittings exhibited features consistent with overstress failure and did not show indications of fatigue and/or other failure modes. The upper two tailboom attachment fittings both contained fatigue cracks throughout almost the entire fracture surface. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  The pilot purchased the helicopter about 3 years before the accident; that same year, the helicopter was issued a new airworthiness certificate. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the previous owner had relinquished the helicopter's airworthiness certificate to avoid punitive action for poor maintenance of the helicopter. Maintenance records located within the helicopter did not contain sufficient information to determine when the most recent maintenance was performed; however, the documents did reveal that several component inspections were not completed within the manufacturer's recommended time. It is likely that long-term, inadequate maintenance of the helicopter contributed to the failure and separation of the tailboom.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The tailboom attachment points were removed from the airframe and sent to the National Transportation Safety Board Laboratory for further examination. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe material research engineer reported that the fracture surfaces of the top right and left attachment point fittings exhibited relatively flat morphologies, with no indications of local material deformation or out of plane fracture. Conversely, the two bottom fittings exhibited darker and rough tortuous fracture surfaces, consistent with overstress failure. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRight Top Fitting&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth mating surfaces of the right top fitting were examined and crack arrest marks, indicative of progressive crack growth, was evident over almost the entire fracture surface. The direction of these arrest marks indicated the cracks initiated near and emanated from a rivet hole within the fitting.  The larger crack grew through almost the entire fitting cross section; the smaller crack progressed toward the opposite direction.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fitting aft fracture surface was further analyzed and the fracture surface exhibited striations, which are consistent with fatigue failure. The area around the rivet hole possessed two fatigue crack initiate sites. The larger crack initiate site was on the outside surface of the fitting, and the smaller crack initiate site occurred at a corner adjacent to the rivet holes. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLeft Top Fitting&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft fracture surface was relatively flat, orientated approximately perpendicular to the length of the fitting. After cleaning the fracture surface, crack arrest marks were observed over most of the fracture surface. The fracture surface consisted of two progressive cracks that initiated on the concave surface and grew in both directions, with fatigue striations throughout.  The cracks grew through approximately 75% of the fitting cross-section, the remaining 15% succumbed to overstress.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBottom Fittings&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fracture surfaces of the bottom fittings exhibited features consistent with overstress failure. The fracture surfaces displayed a dull luster and tortuous surface appearance. Neither of the bottom fittings exhibited indications of fatigue and/or other failure modes. - The Garlick helicopter, serial number 62-2034, was manufactured by Bell Helicopter as serial number 554 in 1962. It was powered by a T53-L13BA engine. The maintenance logbook records were found within the helicopter. The records did not contain dates or aircraft total time, therefore, the most recent maintenance was unable to be determined. The documents did reveal that several component inspections were not completed within the manufacturer's recommended time. During the postaccident examination, the hobbs meter was located and read 6,061.3 hours. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the previous owner relinquished the aircraft's airworthiness certificate to avoid punitive action by the FAA, who had been trying to revoke the airworthiness certificate due to the owner's poor maintenance of the aircraft. In 2010, a new airworthiness certificate was issued for the helicopter to the accident pilot. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA different mechanic reported that the helicopter had recently sat unused for about one month between jobs. The helicopter was put back in service the day before the accident occurred. The mechanic mentioned that the pilot had previously indicated the helicopter felt like it \"shuffled\" during translational lift; however, the mechanic suspected the transmission mounts were starting to wear and would need to be changed at a later date. - On September 16, 2013, about 1535 Pacific daylight time, a Garlick UH-1B, N204UH, experienced a tailboom separation while logging in heavily wooded terrain about 3 miles east of Detroit, Oregon.  The pilot, who was the sole occupant on board, was fatally injured.  The helicopter sustained substantial damage to the tailboom, main rotor system, and fuselage.  The helicopter was registered to Gitmo Holdings LLC, Stevensville, Montana, and operated by R&amp;R Conner under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 as an external load logging flight.  Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and no flight plan had been filed.  The flight originated at about 1500.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses reported that when the helicopter was just above the trees, they either observed or heard the load of logs release early and impact the ground hard.  After looking up, they observed the helicopter's fuselage separate from the tailboom; both descending through the trees. The fuselage impacted the ground inverted and the tailboom came to rest about 140 feet away. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA maintenance worker reported that shortly before the flight, the pilot had landed and shut down the helicopter for about a 45 minute lunch break.  The pilot looked over the helicopter and said he was very happy with it; he said it was running really well. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot on September 17, 2013 by the Office of the State Medical Examiner, Clackamas, Oregon. The pilot's cause of death was blunt force head trauma. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute performed forensic toxicology on specimens from the pilot with negative results for carbon monoxide and ethanol. Rosuvastatin, which is used to treat high cholesterol and related conditions, was detected in the blood and liver. - The nearest weather reporting station was about 38 miles to the northwest at McNary Field Airport in Salem, Oregon at an elevation of 214 feet. At 1556, the weather was reported as wind from 130 degrees as 3 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, broken clouds at 4,900 and overcast clouds at 5,500 feet above ground level (agl), temperature 21 degrees C, dewpoint 13 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.94 inches of mercury. In the remarks section it stated that rain started at 1537 hours and ended at 1552 hours. - The pilot, age 53, held a commercial pilot certificate in helicopter, airplane single-, and multi-engine land, issued on April 27, 2010. The pilot also held an instrument rating in both helicopter and airplane. The pilot held a second-class medical certificate issued on February 12, 2013, with the limitations that he is not valid for any class after, and he must wear corrective lenses. According to the pilot's US Forest Service Helicopter Pilot Qualifications and Approval Records dated July 17, 2013, he reported having 19,000 total helicopter hours, 14,000 of which were in the accident helicopter make and model. - A post accident examination of the airframe and engine occurred in Dallas, Oregon on January 29, 2014. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cabin sustained significant damage.  The windscreen, chin bubble, instrument panel, and roof were all found separated from the structure.  The aft fuselage was mostly intact with the transmission still attached. The tailboom had separated from the aft fuselage at its attachment points; the skin along the sides of the tailboom had a \"wave\" like appearance. The tailboom attachment points were removed from the airframe for further examination. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nControl continuity was established throughout the airframe with the exception of a segment of the tail rotor drive shaft that extended from the transmission, which was not located. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor shaft was fracture separated just below the main rotor head.  The fracture surface was indicative of overload.  At the fracture point, the main rotor shaft was oblong with impact damage on two opposing sides.  Damage was also noted on the main rotor blade hub, indicative of a mast bump event.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was found separated from the helicopter. The exhaust and airframe inlet were removed. Organic debris was noted in the engine inlet, and metal spray was found on the second stage power turbine nozzle vanes. Tear and batter damage was noted to the first stage axial compressor blades and the inlet guide vanes. Rotation of the power turbine produced corresponding rotation to the engine output shaft and overspeed governor drive gearbox; the engine rotated smoothly. The chip detector was examined and no debris was noted. - On scene examination by a FAA Inspector revealed that the helicopter came to rest on the opposite side of a northwest/southeast orientated dirt road from the log landing site.  The terrain was hilly, heavily wooded, and remote.  The trees around the accident site sustained limited damage; one tree was topped and others sustained vertical scrapes down the trunks.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage debris path extended almost parallel to the dirt road; the helicopter came to rest in four major pieces the fuselage/transmission, engine, main rotor blades, and tailboom. The fuselage and transmission were found upside down at the southeastern most point of the wreckage path.  The engine was found in the same general vicinity as the fuselage. The main rotor head and blades were separated from the main rotor shaft, and were located about 120 feet northwest of the main fuselage. One of the main rotor blades was embedded into the ground and extended the second blade into the air at about a 45 degree angle. The tailboom was separated from the fuselage and was located 140 feet northwest of the main rotor blades. The tail rotor gearbox, assembly, and tail rotor blades were still attached to the vertical fin.  One tail rotor blade remained mostly undamaged; the second tail rotor blade sustained a 45 degree bend away from the vertical fin. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "N3156U, serial number 11486, a model R44 II Raven, was manufactured by the Robinson Helicopter Company in 2006. It was powered by a Textron-Lycoming IO-540-AE1A5 engine (serial number L-31554-48A), rated at 235 shaft horsepower.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector who examined the aircraft maintenance records, the last annual inspection was accomplished on July 26, 2013, at a Hobbs meter time of 708.6 hours. At the time of the accident, the Hobbs meter read 728.6 hours. - On August 31, 2013, about 1145 mountain daylight time, a Robinson R44 II, N3156U, collided with power lines and crashed next to a residence in Caballo, New Mexico 87931. The pilot and two passengers were fatally injured. The helicopter was substantially damaged. The helicopter was registered to and operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, and no flight plan had been filed. The flight originated from Truth or Consequences (TCS) Airport, New Mexico, about 1130.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the pilot was taking the two passengers on a short sightseeing flight over Elephant Butte Reservoir. They also plan to fly over the home of one of the passengers. Two witnesses who lived across the street saw the helicopter hovering in front of the passenger's home. They said dust was being stirred up by the rotor wash. The helicopter turned and started to fly away but collided with two service power lines. Another witness, who lived next door to the two previous witnesses, saw the helicopter fly underneath and collide with the power lines, severing the tail boom. The helicopter struck the ground and bounced. Another witness saw the helicopter flying \"extremely low.\" He said the helicopter cleared the power lines, circled back, and then the tail boom struck the power lines. The impact pulled two power poles out of the ground and the helicopter hit the ground and bounced. - According to FAA's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) toxicology report, no carbon monoxide, ethanol, or drugs were detected in the pilot's blood. Cyanide tests were not performed. According to the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator autopsy report, the pilot's death was attributed to \"blunt trauma.\" - The following pertinent weather observations were recorded by the TCS Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS), located about 14 miles north of the accident site:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTCS (1053): Variable wind at 3 knots; sky condition, clear; temperature, 20 degrees Celsius (C.); dew point, 13 degrees C; altimeter setting, 30.15 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTCS (1153): Wind, 090 degrees at 5 knots; sky condition, clear; temperature, 30 degrees C.; dew point, 10 degrees C; altimeter setting, 30.13 inches of mercury. - The pilot, age 34, held a commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument-helicopter ratings. He also held a flight instructor certificate with rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument-helicopter ratings. His second class airman medical certificate, dated May 1, 2013, contained no restrictions or limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the pilot had accrued 1,153 total flight hours, all in rotorcraft-helicopters, of which 1,090 hours were as pilot-in-command and 85.7 hours were flown in a Robinson R44. - According to a Sierra Electric Cooperative Power Company spokesman, two single phase lines were struck by the helicopter, and the impact broke two wooden power poles. He described the lines as being No. 4 ACSR (aluminum conduit, steel reinforced) 7/1 power lines that each carried 14,400 volts. He further stated that the power company did not have monitoring devices to detect power interruptions, but they received the first service call at 1209. FAA's Southwest Regional Operations Center received the accident call at 1153. - The wreckage was located in a field, south of a private residence, and on the east side of State Route 187 at mile post 31.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter rested on its right side. One main rotor blade remained attached to the hub. The other rotor blade was found in several pieces. The tail boom had been severed from the fuselage, and the tail rotor assembly was separated from the tail boom. The front of the cockpit was open, exposing the instrument panel and seats. Power train and flight control continuity were established. Two broken power poles, one holding a power transformer, lay nearby. Two downed power lines, uncoiled in some places, were also noted. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On August 5, 2013, at 0915 central daylight time, a Hughes model 369D helicopter, N8688F, was not damaged when its external cargo long-line was severed after colliding with a shield wire suspended between power transmission towers near Ackerly, Texas. The two linemen who were being hoisted on the long-line were fatally injured after falling about 200 feet to the ground after the collision. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Haverfield Aviation Inc., under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 as an external load flight, without a flight plan. Day visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight, which was operating from a landing zone situated near the accident site.According to the operator, the helicopter was equipped with a 100-foot long external cargo long-line that was being used to hoist linemen onto power transmission towers. Shortly after departure, as the helicopter was climbing toward the transmission tower, the long-line collided with a shield wire suspended between transmission towers. The operator reported that the long-line severed about 5 feet above the linemen. The pilot returned to the landing zone and made an uneventful landing. The operator did not report any malfunction or failures with the helicopter that would have prevented normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that during his repositioning flight he noticed that there were multiple power lines and shield cables erected on the tower structures located to the north and west of the tower to be serviced. After landing, he completed a preflight briefing with the two linemen assigned to his helicopter. After the briefing, the helicopter was brought into a 100-foot hover above the landing zone while the two linemen secured themselves to the long-line below. The pilot reported that as he maneuvered toward the tower he briefly noticed a slight kink in the long-line carrying the linemen before it was severed. The pilot stated that the shield wire installed on the tower had not been identified or discussed during the preflight briefing. He reported that the clear sky condition and the morning light made the shield wire impossible to see from the ground. Additionally, he stated that it was uncommon for shield wire to be installed on the upper tower structures before the lower line work had been completed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe nearest aviation weather reporting station was located at Big Spring McMahon-Wrinkle Airport (KBPG), Big Spring, Texas, about 20 miles southeast of the accident site. At 0915, the KBPG automated surface observing system reported: wind from 160 degrees at 11 knots, visibility 10 miles, sky clear, temperature 28 degrees Celsius, dew point 16 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.10 inches of mercury. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The flight departed under visual flight rules (VFR) and then obtained VFR flight following before proceeding in a southeasterly direction. About 28 minutes after takeoff, while flying about 3,000 feet mean sea level over a sparsely populated and heavily wooded area with few ground reference lights, the flight likely encountered light rain. The pilot flew south of a wind turbine, initiated an approximate 180-degree left turn with 300 feet altitude loss, then began following a dirt road associated with the wind turbines. After completion of the turn he advised the controller, \"...we're inadvertent IMC [instrument meteorological conditions], reversing...\" and asked for a heading to the nearest airport. The controller asked the pilot if he wanted a vector to the nearest airport and also if the flight was in IMC, but there was no reply. The controller provided a heading for a vector to a nearby airport but the pilot did not respond. The flight continued in the same orientation following the course reversal, flying past another wind turbine before turning right; the controller again advised the pilot of the direction to the nearest airport. The pilot immediately responded that he was, \"...having trouble maintaining control here.\" The controller informed the pilot that the nearest airport was heading 068 degrees and 8 miles away, and the recorded radar data indicates the pilot flew a north-northeasterly heading with changes in altitude noted. The comments from the pilot followed by the maneuvering (changes in altitude and heading) were consistent with the known effects of spatial disorientation. Radio and radar contact were lost; the helicopter descended on an east-northeasterly heading into trees and terrain in a heavily wooded area away from any nearby wind turbines. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter revealed extensive impact damage, although there was no evidence of a preimpact failure with the flight controls, drive line, or structure. The engine was found to operate normally and data downloaded from the engine monitoring unit indicates no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhile there was no record of an official preflight weather briefing before departure, a text message from the non-instrument rated pilot to his brother approximately 1 hour before departure stating, \"...Waiting out weather to fly back to [Ocean City, MD] tonight\" indicates that to some extent he was aware of the weather. Had the pilot obtained an official preflight weather briefing for the intended VFR flight, the briefing specialist likely would have advised him against VFR flight due to IMC (ceiling less than 1,000 feet and visibility less than 3 miles) and mountain obscuration that were forecast to exist in the accident area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the left seat occupant was a student pilot, it is unlikely the pilot-in-command was giving him instruction during the accident flight. While operation of a helicopter with decreased ceiling and visibility can be safely performed, the environmental conditions in the accident site area consisting of a sparsely populated heavily wooded area with few ground reference lights and no illumination from the moon were indicators that VFR flight should not have continued.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 27, 2013, about 2220 eastern daylight time, a Robinson Helicopter Company R66 helicopter N646AG, operated by a private individual, collided with trees and terrain near Noxen, Pennsylvania. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed in the area at the time and no flight plan was filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 personal flight from Tri-Cities Airport (CZG), Endicott, New York, to Jake Arner Memorial Airport (22N), Lehighton, Pennsylvania. The helicopter was destroyed and the commercial-rated pilot and 4 passengers were fatally injured. The flight originated from CZG about 2151.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight departed VFR, and at 2153, the non-instrument rated pilot contacted Binghamton Approach Control and advised the controller that the flight had just departed CZG, and was requesting visual flight rules (VFR) flight following. The controller provided the altimeter setting (30.00 inches of Mercury) and asked the pilot the destination and requested altitude, to which he replied 22N, and 3,000 feet msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA discrete transponder code was assigned (4606), and the flight was radar identified 3 miles southwest of CZG. The flight proceeded in a southwesterly direction flying about 3,000 feet until about 2157, then turned to a south-southeasterly heading while flying between 2,600 and 3,000 feet msl. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2204, air traffic control communications were transferred to Wilkes-Barre Approach Control; the pilot established contact with that facility advising the controller that the flight was level at 3,000 feet msl. The Wilkes-Barre Approach controller acknowledged the transmission, and issued an altimeter setting of 30.00 inches of Mercury. While in contact with that facility the flight proceeded in a southeasterly direction with altitude and slight heading changes until about 2219, at which time recorded radar reflects a left turn to a northwesterly direction. Correlation of the radar targets from recordings of the Wilkes-Barre airport surveillance radar with locations of wind turbines in the area revealed that between 2218:55, and 2219:00, the helicopter flew west of the B-26 wind turbine, and continued in a southeasterly direction, then when turning to a northwesterly direction about 2219:19, the pilot flew just south of the B-21 wind turbine. The radar targets depict the flight path above and adjacent to a road associated with the wind turbines while turning to a northwesterly direction; no determination could be made whether the pilot had visual contact with the road. At 2219:40, while just east of the B-16 wind turbine, the pilot advised the controller, \"we're inadvertent IMC, reversing ah, can you give us a heading to the nearest airport, please.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe controller asked the pilot if he wanted a heading to the nearest airport and if the flight was in IFR conditions but the pilot did not respond to that transmission. The radar data reflects that the helicopter continued in a northwesterly direction until 2219:53. About 6 seconds later, the controller instructed the pilot to fly heading 068 degrees for vectors to an airport, to which he replied 5 seconds later \"6 alpha golf having trouble maintaining control here.\" The helicopter at that time was located about 1,105 feet east-southeast of the previous radar target 10 seconds earlier, and had descended from 2,800 to 2,600 feet msl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe radar data from Wilkes-Barre Approach reflects that between 2220:03 and 2220:17, the flight proceeded in a northeasterly heading with some altitude deviation noted. The controller then asked the pilot, \"helicopter 6AG ah you having trouble maintaining altitude sir\", to which the pilot immediately replied, \"Affirmative 6AG.\" The radar data reflected that between 2220:17, and 2220:27, the helicopter descended from 2,600 to 2,300 feet, though the coordinates remained unchanged. Radio and radar contact were lost. The pilot of a nearby airline flight attempted to communicate with the pilot at 2221, but there was no reply.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter crashed on privately owned wooded land leased to an energy company; there were no known witnesses to the accident that occurred during a dark night.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA 406 MHz emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal was received at the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC) at 2224, and the Pennsylvania State Police and State Emergency Operations Center were notified. A search was initiated, but adverse weather (heavy fog) caused the search to be called off in the early morning hours. The search resumed several hours later when the weather conditions improved; the wreckage was located on July 28, 2013, about 1350.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot seated in the right seat, age 30, held a commercial pilot certificate with rotorcraft helicopter rating issued January 19, 2012. He also held a certified flight instructor certificate with rotorcraft helicopter rating issued February 25, 2012. He was issued a first class medical certificate with no limitations on April 30, 2012. On the application for his last medical certificate he listed a total time of 350 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHis 2nd pilot logbook contained entries from the first dated February 12, 2013, to the last dated July 21, 2013. He carried forward a total flight time of 952 hours, 14.5 hours simulated instrument time, and 6.0 hours turbine powered rotorcraft helicopter, though the make and model helicopter was not specified. Including his carry forward time he logged a total time of approximately 1,328 hours, of which 1,274 hours were as pilot-in-command. He did not log any simulated or actual instrument flight time in the 2nd pilot logbook. Excluding the unlogged flights after July 21, 2013, he logged a total of approximately 92 hours night flight time, of which approximately 5 hours were in the previous 90 days, and 0.3 hour, or 18 minutes was logged in the previous 30 days. The last logged night flight occurred on July 16, 2013, and was flown in a Robinson R22.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther review of his 2nd logbook revealed an entry dated July 19, 2013 indicating his attendance of a R66 helicopter pilot safety course at the manufacturer's facility. A total of approximately 1 hour was logged in the R66 helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDocuments provided by Robinson Helicopter Company associated with the pilot/flight instructor safety course revealed that on the application dated June 28, 2013, he listed in part having accrued 1,306 hours total helicopter hours, and 6 hours in R66 helicopters. Ground training was conducted July 15 through July 18, 2013, and on July 19, 2013, an approximately 1.0 hour flight was conducted in an R66 helicopter. On the \"Instructor/Pilot Evaluation\" form for training conducted in the R66, the instructor indicated his proficiency was above average in \"Knowledge\" with a comment indicating, \"Well studied on systems.\" He was marked average for the remainder of the maneuvers, and a comment in the General Comments section indicated, \"Flew well – no problems noted. Taking delivery of R-66 today.\" In addition, he was approved to transition other pilot's in Robinson R66 helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing completion of the pilot/flight instructor safety course at the manufacturer's facility, he and another pilot flew the helicopter during the course of several flights over a 3 day period from California to Hampton Roads Executive Airport (PVG), Norfolk, Virginia. While the pilot logged the time (approximately 19.6 hours) as dual received and pilot-in-command, the other individual who flew with him and who is a certified flight instructor reported flying the helicopter 7.4 hours. He also indicated he did not give the accident pilot any flight instruction during any of the flights, and further, he did not sign his pilot logbook indicating he had given him flight instruction. The individual who flew with the accident pilot reported there were no discrepancies with the helicopter, and all systems worked OK with no squawks noted. After an uneventful arrival in Virginia at PVG, the other pilot departed, and the accident pilot flew the helicopter to Ocean City Municipal Airport (OXB), Ocean City, Maryland; the flight duration was logged to be approximately 1 hour, and there were no further logged flights in the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nData downloaded from the Engine Monitoring Unit (EMU) correlated with unlogged flights in the pilot's pilot logbook revealed he accrued approximately 7 hours, bringing his total time to 1,335 hours. On the accident date including the accident flight, the helicopter was operated on 6 flights totaling approximately 6 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe occupant seated in the left front seat was issued a student pilot medical certificate on February 19, 2013, with a restriction to wear corrective lenses. On the application for the medical certificate he listed 10 hours flight time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was manufactured by Robinson Helicopter Company in 2013, under a production certificate issued on October 25, 2010, and designated serial number 0409. It was equipped with a Rolls-Royce 250-C300/A1 engine rated for 270 horsepower for takeoff limited to 5 minutes or 224 horsepower continuous. The helicopter was equipped with 5 seats.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was approved for VFR operations day and night. VFR operation at night is permitted only when landing, navigation, instrument, and anti-collision lights are operational. Section 2 of the Pilot's Operating Handbook and FAA Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual indicates that in \"Kinds of Operating Limitations\" that orientation during night flight must be maintained by visual reference to ground objects illuminated solely by lights on the ground or adequate celestial illumination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the airframe and engine logbooks revealed no entries other than those associated with production of the airframe or engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the hour meter, the elapsed time since manufacture at the time of the accident was 33.08 hours, while the engine monitoring unit indicates a total engine run time of approximately 28 hours, and 18 engine starts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no record with Lockheed Martin AFSS, or either DUAT vendor (CSC or DTC) that the pilot obtained a preflight weather briefing before departure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirmet Sierra Update 6, for IFR conditions issued by National Weather Service (NWS) at 1645, and valid until 2300, bordered the immediate vicinity of the accident site. The Airmet indicated that between 2000 and 2300, and continuing beyond 2300 to 0500 the next day, ceilings below 1,000 feet and visibilities below 3 miles with precipitation and mist were forecast. The Airmet for mountain obscuration, which extended over the route and the accident site, indicated that between 1700 and 2000, and continuing beyond 2300 to 0500 the next day, clouds, precipitation, and mist were forecast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NWS Weather Depiction Chart for 1800 EDT depicted an area of instrument flight rule (IFR) conditions over eastern Pennsylvania by a shaded contour line due to visibility 2 miles in thunderstorms and moderate rain, which was surrounding by an area of marginal visual flight rule (MVFR) conditions by an unshaded contour line. Multiple stations across western Pennsylvania and New York reported rain and thunderstorms with MVFR conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA surface observation taken from Binghamton Regional Airport (BGM), Binghamton, NY, at 2142, or approximately 9 minutes before the flight departed indicates the wind was from 190 degrees at 8 knots, the visibility was 2.5 miles with moderate rain and mist, broken clouds existed at 600 feet and 1,400 feet, and overcast clouds existed at 7,000 feet. The temperature and dew point were 19 and 18 degrees Celsius, respectively, and the altimeter setting was 29.99 inches of Mercury (inHg).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2045, or approximately 1 hour 6 minutes before the flight departed, the Area Forecast (FA) issued by the National Weather Service Aviation Weather Center indicated that for eastern Pennsylvania, expected broken clouds at 3,500 feet layered to 25,000 feet, with widely scattered thunderstorms and light rain, with cumulonimbus tops to 38,000 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2054, or approximately 1 hour before the flight departed, the pilot sent a text message to his brother indicating, \"…Waiting out weather to fly back to [Ocean City, MD] tonight.\" At the same time, a surface observation from the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport (AVP), Scranton, PA, located approximately 18 miles east-southeast of the accident site reported wind from 220 degrees at 4 knots, 10 miles visibility with light rain, scattered clouds at 7,000 feet, broken clouds at 8,000 feet, and overcast clouds at 10,000 feet. The temperature and dew point were 22 and 18 degrees Celsius, respectively, and the altimeter setting was 30.00 in Hg. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2100, or approximately 51 minutes before the flight departed, the Weather Depiction Chart depicted a larger area of MVFR conditions extending over across western and central New York and northern Pennsylvania along and ahead of the approaching frontal system. The accident site was located in the area of MVFR conditions. Visual flight rule (VFR) conditions were depicted across southern Pennsylvania into Maryland, with the station models depicted overcast sky coverage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe GOES-13 infrared satellite imagery for 2202 and 2232 EDT respectively with a standard MB temperature enhance curve applied to highlight the higher and colder cloud tops typically associated with convective activity.   The images depict an extensive area of low clouds over the region with a north-to-south band of enhanced clouds moving over the route of flight at the time of the accident, with the radiative cloud top temperatures corresponding to cloud tops between 29,000 and 33,500 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest Weather Surveillance Radar-1988, Doppler (WSR-88D) to the accident site was from the NWS Binghamton (KBGM) located approximately 46 miles north of the accident site, at an elevation of 1,606 feet. Based on the radar height calculations, the 0.5 degree elevation scan depicted the conditions encompassing the altitude between 3,230 and 7,860 feet over the accident site, with the floor just above the helicopters altitude. The KBGM 0.5 degree base reflectivity image at 2220 EDT depicts the accident site area with light reflectivity values of 15 to 20 dBZ, and several high reflectivity echoes on the range of 50 dBZ east of the general route of flight associated with embedded thunderstorms with one of the cells immediately north of Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport (AVP), which was reporting IFR conditions in heavy rain at the time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA remote automated weather station RAWS located about 24 miles northwest of the accident site reported at 2201, or approximately 19 minutes before the accident, that the wind was calm, the temperature and dew point were 67 and 66 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively, and the relative humidity was 95 percent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA surface observation taken from AVP at 2221, or approximately 1 minute after the accident indicates the wind was variable at 4 knots, the visibility was 1.25 miles with heavy rain and mist, runway 04 visual range (RVR) 4,000 variable 6,000 feet, a few clouds at 600 feet, broken clouds at 1200 feet, and overcast clouds at 4,900 feet. The temperature and dew point were 19 and 18 degrees Celsius, respectively, and the altimeter setting was 30.00 inHg.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA RAWS located approximately 15 miles north-northeast of the accident site reported at 2229, or approximately 9 minutes after the accident, that the wind was calm, the temperature and dew point were 66 and 62 degrees Fahrenheit, respectively, the relative humidity was 88 percent, and rain was being recorded at the time of the observation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on the approximate location of the accident, sunset occurred at 2025, and the end of civil twilight occurred at 2056. The Sun and the Moon were more than 15 degrees below the horizon and provided no illumination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFLIGHT RECORDERS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an Engine Monitoring Unit (EMU) that is a digital recording device mounted behind the right rear seatback panel. The EMU records and retains data consisting of total engine run time, an engine start counter (whenever N1 exceeds 30 percent and Measured Gas Temperature (MGT) is at least 343 degrees Celsius), and exceedances for N1, N1 run limit, N2 transient, N2 run limit, Torque Meter Oil Pressure (TMOP) transient, TMOP exceedance, TMOP run limit, MGT transient start- up mode, MGT start-up mode, MGT run limit start up, MGT transient run mode, MGT run mode, MGT run limit run mode, and torque. The EMU also records and retains data consisting of flight history (date, engine start time and duration), and in 1 second increments N1 and N2 speeds in percent, TMOP psi, and MGT in Fahrenheit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nData downloaded from the revealed that the accident flight and 17 previous flights were recorded; 1 entry totaling 4 seconds on July 19, 2013 was noted but was not attributed to a flight. There were no recorded exceedances for any of the flights. Data associated with the accident flight totaled approximately 37 minutes 35 seconds; an approximate 14 second gap of data was noted between 0222:32 and 0222:46 Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), or between 2222:32 and 2222:46 local EMU time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the recorded data associated with the accident flight revealed that slight variation to N2 below 100 percent was noted for about 6 minutes 49 seconds after the first recorded data point, or until 0152:00.500 (2152:00.500 local), at which time the N2 (equivalent to main rotor speed), and TMOP were recorded to be consistently above 100 percent and 50 psi, respectively. The recorded N2 readings were nearly constant with slight changes for the next 29 minutes 17 seconds, or until 0221:17.312 (2221:17.312), while the TMOP readings were nearly constant with slight changes notes between 0152:00.500 (2152:00.500 local) and 0220:40.312 (2220:40.312), at which time the TMOP began to decrease. Changes to recorded TMOP occurred from then until 0222:46.937 (2222:46.937 hours local), which was the last recorded data point. A copy of the recorded data associated with the accident flight downloaded from the EMU is contained in the NTSB public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter crashed in a heavy wooded area owned by several family members, who leased the land to an energy company which installed 88 wind turbines. According to the site manager, on the date and time of the accident, the wind turbines were down for maintenance and Notice to Airman # 07/025 was disseminated indicating the wind turbines were not illuminated. The site manager also advised that there was no damage to any of the wind turbines, and they do not have any cameras or recording equipment on them.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed damage to trees at decreasing heights and debris along an energy path oriented on a magnetic heading of 074 degrees. Major parts of the helicopter consisting of the main rotor assembly, mast, transmission, tail rotor assembly, and horizontal and vertical stabilizers were separated from the helicopter and located along the energy path southwest of the resting portion of the main wreckage. Numerous cockpit and cabin furnishings as well as cockpit and cabin doors, landing gear pieces, and personal effects were also located along the energy path. There was no smell of fuel at the accident site, and no evidence of fire. The accident site was not located near any wind turbines.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther inspection of the accident site revealed the farthest identified impacted trees were located at 41.4546 degrees North latitude and 076.0926 degrees West longitude. The trees were nearly aligned and perpendicular to the energy path and were about 16 feet apart. When viewed from that location towards the resting point of the main wreckage, the tree to the left was damaged at an estimated height of 55 feet above ground level (agl), while the tree to the right was damaged 45.12 feet agl (measured using Theodolite App). A distance of 59.05 feet existed between the estimated impact point in the creek bed and the tree that was fractured 45.12 feet agl, while the calculated angle between the two points was 27.5 degrees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main portion of the wreckage consisting of the fuselage was inverted near the base of 2 trees adjacent to a creek; the wreckage was located at 41.4547 degrees North latitude and 076.0923 degrees West longitude. It came to rest on a magnetic heading of 040 degrees magnetic. The fuel tank was drained following recovery of the wreckage and found to contain 54 gallons of jet fuel; no contaminants were noted. A small amount of a liquid with the appearance and odor of Jet A fuel was drained from the fuel line to the fuel pump when the line was detached from the fuel pump. No breaches of the fuel system were noted, and there was no evidence of fuel spillage on the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe was almost completely destroyed. The main rotor and gearbox were detached from the airframe, with the mast fairing remaining attached to the mast tube. The mast fairing exhibited a large dent on the trailing edge, which corresponded to the bent mast tube and main rotor mast. The rear fuselage was intact and the rear cowling was attached. The tailcone was bent and wrapped around the left side of the airframe. The tailcone was separated in the approximate center of the 5th bay. The remaining 2 ½ bays were intact, but detached from the empennage. There was a large dent on the upper surface of the aft 2 bays. The empennage was intact. The lower vertical stabilizer was bent approximately 90 degrees rearward, and there was a circular shaped dent at the intersection between the lower vertical and horizontal stabilizers. The dent contained wood debris and bark scrapings. The tail rotor visual guard was fractured at the front of the lower vertical stabilizer. The forward end remained attached to the tailcone and the aft portion was attached to the lower vertical stabilizer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInspection of the flight controls revealed numerous fractures; however, there was no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction. Inspection of the driveline revealed no evidence of preimpact failure or malfunction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the firewall revealed it was deformed in several places and rotational scoring from the engine output shaft at the firewall penetration point was noted. The fuel cut-off valve was in a forward, or off position, and the control cable was detached from the control arm. The control cable sheath was secure in the retention clamps. The cable end was not visible protruding from the end of the sheath, and the sheath exhibited stretching and separation of the coils between the engine and the control in the cabin.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit was fragmented, and flight and engine instruments were located along the energy path. Additionally, the instrument panel was separated. All of the removable controls were installed. The collective was in a full up position, and the friction slider was straight and was fractured at the lower end. The pilot's throttle twist grip was in the \"on\" or \"flight position.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInspection of the separated instrument panel revealed it contained the airspeed indicator, faceplate of the turn coordinator, and directional gyro. The housing of the turn coordinator was separated from the panel, and was accounted for at the accident site. The annunciator panel contains LED type lights; therefore, no determination could be made as to whether there were any annunciations at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInspection of the engine and engine compartment revealed the throttle valve on the engine right side was in a rearward, or 'flight' position, and the control cable was detached from the control arm. The control cable sheath was secure in the retention clamps. The cable end was not visible protruding from the end of the sheath, and the sheath exhibited stretching and separation of the coils between the engine and the control in the cabin. The power turbine governor (PTG) needle was in a position between 30 and 40, and the control cable and linkage was intact and secure. The PTG 'beep' control actuator when tested by hand. The F642-1 shaft was separated at the flex couplings at both ends. At the engine end, 1 flexplate ear was torn and one F906-1 yoke arm was torn. At the main rotor gearbox (MRGB) end, assembly was intact and in place. The sprag clutch unit locked and free-wheeled normally the flexplate arms were torn on opposite sides, and one MRGB input yoke arm was separated from both the flexplate and the input \"shaft\".&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain rotor blade SN 0950 exhibited a fractured spar was broken at approximately 6 feet from the coning bolt, and the tip of the blade was detached, but accounted for at the accident site. The blade skin/honeycomb was damaged at tip. There was a gentle upward bend over the inboard 6 feet of the blade, and again for the outboard 4 feet of blade. Wood was embedded in the spar of the blade at the tip. Some minor dents and one tear were visible on the lower skin. 2 small pieces of the removable tip cap were located. The spindle tusk was intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain rotor blade SN 0954 \"exhibited a 90 degree downward bend approximately 90 inches from coning bolt, with a partial spar fracture, and spar separated at 160 inches from coning bolt. Skin/honeycomb portion detached from spar at separation, and was not located. The outboard approximate 36 inches of main rotor blade was later accounted for; the spindle tusk was intact. A report concerning the separated outboard section of main rotor blade is contained in the NTSB public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed it exhibited little visible damage. The output shaft/sprag clutch assembly exhibited significant damage. The engine which was secure in its mount points was removed, and sent to the manufacturer's facility, where with FAA oversight, it was placed in a test cell and found to operate normally. The report from the manufacturer and statement from the FAA inspector that witnessed the engine run are contained in the NTSB public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostmortem examinations of the pilot and left seat occupant were performed by Forensic Associates of NEPA, Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania. The cause of death for both was listed as multiple traumatic injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExternal examinations only were performed on the remaining occupants. The cause of death for all was listed as multiple traumatic injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForensic toxicology was performed on specimens of the pilot and left seat occupant by the FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The toxicology report for the pilot stated the results were negative for carbon monoxide, volatiles, and tested drugs, while testing for cyanide was not performed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe toxicology report for the left seat occupant stated the results were negative for volatiles and tested drugs, while the specimens were unsuitable for carbon monoxide testing; testing for cyanide was not performed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe first uncorrelated radar target at 2151:34, was located at 42 degrees 04 seconds 23.88 seconds North latitude and 076 degrees 06 minutes 23.40 seconds West longitude, or about 0.42 nautical miles from the center of a ramp at the departure airport. Review of the EMU recorded data revealed the estimated takeoff was at EMU time 0152:00.500 (2152:00.500). No determination could be made as to how the helicopter proceeded between the EMU time estimated at takeoff and the first uncorrelated radar target.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCorrelation of the EMU data with the transmissions from the pilot and the radar data indicates that the changes to the TMOP from the near steady state condition after takeoff occurred about 4 seconds after the pilot advised the controller that the flight was inadvertent IMC, which also was at a point when changes in heading and altitude were noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL DATA AND INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeight and Balance Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of manufacture, the basic empty weight was 1,346.2 pounds and the empty weight moment was 146392. No modifications were recorded in the maintenance records between the time of manufacture and the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBaggage and  personal effects that were found either in bags in the baggage compartment, on the ground adjacent to the main wreckage, or loose at the accident site were recovered and secured at a facility of the Pennsylvania State Police. The items that were wet were air dried, and the weight of all items was determined to be 159.5 pounds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeight and balance calculations were performed using the empty weight of the helicopter (1,346.2 pounds), the weight of the pilot and left front seat occupant per the Coroner (140 and 170 pounds), respectively. The weights of the rear seat occupants from left to right also reported by the coroner were 127, 33, and 190 pounds, respectively. Additionally, the calculations included the weight of the luggage (159.5 pounds), and full usable fuel amount of 493.1 pounds. The calculations determined that at the moment of engine start, the gross weight was 2,658.8 pounds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter type certificate data sheet, the design gross weight is 2,700 pounds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSpatial Disorientation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Advisory Circular (AC) 60-4A titled, \"Pilot's Spatial Disorientation,\" surface references and the natural horizon may become obscured even though visibility may be above VFR minimums and that an inability to perceive the natural horizon or surface references is common during flights over water, at night, in sparsely populated areas, and in low-visibility conditions. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter was flying northeast following a line of utility poles for the aerial survey flight. A surviving passenger, who occupied the left rear seat, reported that the helicopter began to rotate in a clockwise direction just before impact. A second surviving passenger, who occupied the left front seat, stated that the helicopter was flying straight and level before it began to spin. He added that, before impact, he heard the low rotor rpm warning horn. The helicopter impacted heavily forested terrain in a steep nose-down, right-bank attitude. At the time of the accident, the helicopter was about 200 lbs below its maximum gross weight. Wind was calculated to be between 2 and 16 knots from the southwest with maximum gusts of about 20 knots near the accident site, which would have resulted in a tailwind condition. Examination of the helicopter did not reveal any anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVideo footage recorded by a passenger showed the helicopter traveling about 39 knots on a northeasterly heading and at an altitude of about 200 ft above ground level. The groundspeed then began to decay to about 30 knots over a period of about 30 seconds. The helicopter then yawed right, and the groundspeed dropped to 22.6 knots. The helicopter then appeared to develop an uncontrollable right spin, and the video ended with the helicopter crashing into the forest below. It is likely that the combination of the helicopter's high gross weight, the reduction in airspeed, and the tailwind condition led to a loss of tail rotor effectiveness, which resulted in the right yaw from which the pilot did not recover control.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The FAA Rotorcraft Flying Handbook, publication FAA-H-8030-21, Unanticipated Yaw/Loss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness (LTS), states in part that unanticipated yaw is the occurrence of an uncommanded yaw rate that does not subside of its own accord and, which, if not corrected, can result in the loss of helicopter control. This uncommanded yaw rate is referred to as a loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) and occurs to the right in helicopters with counter-rotating main rotor and to the left in helicopters with a clockwise main rotor rotation. LTE is not related to an equipment or maintenance malfunction and may occur in all single-rotor helicopters at airspeeds less than 30 knots. It is the result of the tail rotor not providing adequate thrust to maintain directional control. The required tail rotor thrust is modified by the effects of the wind. The wind can cause an uncommanded yaw by changing tail rotor effective thrust.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Advisory Circular (AC) 90-95, Unanticipated Right Yaw in Helicopters, dated February 26, 1995 states that the loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE) is a critical, low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic which could result in an uncommanded rapid yaw rate which does not subside of its own accord and, if not corrected, could result in the loss of aircraft control. It also states, \"LTE is not related to a maintenance malfunction and may occur in varying degrees in all single main rotor helicopters at airspeeds less than 30 knots.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nParagraph 6 of the AC covered conditions under which LTE may occur. It states:&#x0D;\n\"Any maneuver which requires the pilot to operate in a high-power, low-airspeed environment with a left crosswind or tailwind creates an environment where unanticipated right yaw may occur.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nParagraph 8 of the AC states:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"OTHER FACTORS...Low Indicated Airspeed. At airspeeds below translational lift, the tail rotor is required to produce nearly 100 percent of the directional control. If the required amount of tail rotor thrust is not available for any reason, the aircraft will yaw to the right.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nParagraph 9 of the AC states: \"When maneuvering between hover and 30 knots: (1) Avoid tailwinds. If loss of translational lift occurs, it will result in an increased high power demand and an additional anti-torque requirement. (2) Avoid out of ground effect (OGE) hover and high power demand situations, such as low-speed downwind turns. (3) Be especially aware of wind direction and velocity when hovering in winds of about 8-12 knots (especially OGE). There are no strong indicators to the pilot of a reduction of translation lift. (4) Be aware that if considerable amount of left pedal is being maintained a sufficient amount of left pedal may not be available to counteract an unanticipated right yaw. (5) Be alert to changing aircraft flight and wind conditions which may be experienced when flying along ridge lines and around buildings. (6) Stay vigilant to power and wind conditions.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRobinson Helicopters Safety Notice SN-42, UNANTICIPATED YAW, issued May, 2013, states that a pilot's failure to apply proper pedal inputs in response to strong or gusty winds during hover or low-speed flight may result in an unanticipated yaw. Some pilots mistakenly attribute this yaw to loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE), implying that the tail rotor stalled or was unable to provide adequate thrust. Tail rotors on Robinson helicopters are designed to have more authority than many other helicopters and are unlikely to experience LTE. To avoid unanticipated yaw, pilots should be aware of conditions (a left crosswind, for example) that may require large or rapid pedal inputs. Practicing slow, steady-rate hovering pedal turns will help maintain proficiency in controlling yaw. Hover training with a qualified instructor in varying wind conditions may also be helpful. - The helicopter was a Robinson R44 II, serial number 10481, manufactured in 2004. The operator reported that the helicopter's maximum gross weight was 2,500 pounds, that it seated four, and that it would have weighed about 2,300 pounds at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was powered by a 245-horsepower Lycoming IO-540-AE1A5 engine. The last annual maintenance inspection was conducted on July 8, 2013, at a total airframe and engine time of 786.2 hours. The helicopter had a total of 799 hours at the time of the accident, as it had operated 13 hours since its last maintenance inspection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe examination of the maintenance records also revealed that on December 27, 2012, at a total airframe time of 778.9 hours, \"Fuel bladder tanks installed. Aircraft returned to service.\" Additionally, the entry noted that this work \"Complied with Robinson Helicopter Company SB-78B, using Robinson Helicopter Kit KI-196-2, IAW kit instruction KI-196-2, Revision \"B\" dated 10 Jan 2011. Revised Weight and Balance.\" - On July 27, 2013, about 1255 mountain daylight time, a Robinson R44 II helicopter, N25WH, was substantially damaged following a loss of control and subsequent impact with terrain near Thompson Falls, Montana. The helicopter was registered to Zoot Helicopter I LLC, of Bozeman, Montana, and operated by Rocky Mountain Rotors, of Belgrade, Montana. The certified commercial pilot received fatal injuries; one passenger sustained serious injuries, and a second passenger suffered minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the aerial survey flight, which was being conducted in accordance with 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91, and no flight plan was filed. The flight departed the Polson Airport (8S1), about 2 hours prior to the time of the accident. The intended destination was Thompson Falls.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the passenger who sustained minor injuries, the purpose of the flight was to photo document the condition of cross-country power lines and their supporting wooden structures. The passenger reported that the pilot occupied the right front seat, his associate, who was operating videotaping equipment, occupied the left front seat, and he occupied the left rear seat taking still photographs. The passenger stated that initially everything was going fine, and that they were about 50 feet from the power lines and about 50 feet above them. However, the helicopter started to rotate in a clockwise orientation, about 4 revolutions prior to impact with terrain. He described the impact attitude of the helicopter as being very steep, nose down, and banked to the right. There was no postcrash fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 6 months after the accident, the left-front-seat passenger, who was assigned to operate the onboard video camera, was interviewed via telephone by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC). The passenger stated that prior to the start of the helicopter spinning it was flying straight and level, and the next thing he remembered was the helicopter impacting a tree. He further stated that prior to impact he heard the Low Rotor rpm warning horn, as he had heard several times [during the starting of the helicopter's engine]. The passenger further stated that prior to the start of the spin, he did not recall any adverse wind conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn NTSB Vehicle Recorder Specialist was able to download recorded data from an onboard Sony Handycam HDR CX550 recorder; the unit was equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The recorder captured the entire accident sequence. The specialist's review of the data revealed the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was initially observed operating about 8.5 nautical miles west-southwest of Thompson Falls, Montana, along the Montana Secondary Highway 471. About 1248, the helicopter was circling over a power substation at a groundspeed between 40 to 50 knots, at an altitude of about 3,400 feet mean sea level (msl). About 1250, the helicopter departed the substation and began following a line of utility poles northeast bound. About 1251, the helicopter was observed in a left-hand circle around a group of utility poles near a creek at an altitude of 3,226 feet msl. At 1251:38, the helicopter departed back to the northeast and continued to follow utility poles at a speed of 42 knots at an altitude of 3,220 feet msl. The helicopter then entered two more circles to the left at 1252:12, at which time its speed varied between 30 to 40 knots. At 1254:26, the helicopter was re-established on a northeast heading along the utility line at an altitude of 3,162 feet msl and a groundspeed of 39 knots; by 1255:00, the helicopter's groundspeed had decayed to 30 knots. At 1255:02, the helicopter began to yaw to the right as its speed further decayed to 22.6 knots at 1255:04. The helicopter completed a 360-degree spin by 1255:06 and continued to spin to the right. The GPS track continued to deviate for the remainder of the recording, and the groundspeed fluctuated below 22.6 knots until the recorded data terminated. Just before impact, the pilot's feet are shown and the left pedal is deflected forward. The helicopter struck trees about 1255:13, then the recording ended. - An autopsy of the pilot was performed at the Montana Division of Forensic Science, Missoula, Montana, on July 29, 2013. The cause of death was listed as \"blunt force injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing on the pilot was performed by the FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute's (CAMI) Forensic Toxicology and Accident Research Center at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The toxicological tests were negative for alcohol and drugs. - An NTSB Meteorological Specialist reported that a review of the available weather in the area of where the accident occurred, included the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Weather Surface (NWS) Surface Analysis Chart for 1200 MDT depicted that a low pressure center was located at the central portion of Montana's border with Canada. A stationary front extended south-southeastward from the low pressure center into north-central Colorado. Another low pressure center was identified along the eastern portion of the Washington/Oregon border.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMany station models in the accident region depicted clear skies, with winds across the region generally 10 knots or less, with direction variable. Temperatures near the accident site were from the mid-70 degrees F to the mid-80 degrees F, with dew points ranging from about 30 degrees F to 60 degrees F.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA composite radar imagery mosaic at 1300 MDT of the accident region from the National Severe Storms Laboratory's National Mosaic and Q2 System did not identify any areas of reflectivity near the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn Automated Surface Observing System station (ASOS) named KMLP, was located near the Mullan Pass VOR in Mullan Pass, Idaho, about 8 nautical miles (nm) to the southwest of the accident site at an elevation of about 6,000 feet mean sea level (msl). At 1253 MDT, KMLP reported wind variable at 4 knots, visibility of 10 miles or greater, clear skies, temperature 19 degrees C, dew point 2 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.17 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nU.S. Bureau of Land Management/USDA Forest Service Remote Automated Weather System (RAWS) station THAM8, was located about 10 miles to the east-northeast of the accident site at an elevation of about 2,426 feet msl. At 1302, THAM8 reported a temperature of 88 degrees F, a dew point temperature of 47.9 degrees F, relative humidity of 17 percent, and wind from 317 degrees at 7.8 knots with gusts to 17.4 knots. Feedback from the NWS Office in Missoula, Montana, regarding the THAM8 revealed that there was no reason to question wind speeds reported at 1302, and that they appeared to be consistent with the increasing westerly winds reported on the day of the accident at similarly sited (valley) stations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NTSB Specialist reported that a Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) simulation was run to estimate wind conditions in the area of the accident site at 1300. WRF simulations of the wind identified sustained wind magnitudes of generally between 2-16 knots through the region, with the wind being from nearly the southwest at the accident site. Wind gust simulations yielded a maximum gust magnitude of close to 20 knots near the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn Area Forecast Discussion was issued at 0930 MDT by the NWS Forecast Office in Missoula for an area that included the accident location. In part, the discussion revealed that a trough moving through British Columbia would flatten the ridge in Idaho and western Montana, with an increase in winds expected during the afternoon as a westerly pressure gradient developed, with afternoon winds approaching 25 knots at times.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Red Flag Warning was issued at 0402 by the NWS Forecast Office in Missoula for an area east of the accident location effective at 1200. The warning message advised of west winds of 15 to 20 miles-per-hour (mph) with gusts to 30 mph. The warning indicated that winds would begin to increase around mid-day, and peak in the late afternoon/early evening.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident pilot did not receive a DUAT, DUATS or Lockheed Martin Flight Services telephone weather briefing prior to the accident flight. It is not known if the pilot received preflight weather information from another source.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n(Refer to the NTSB Group Chairman's Factual Meteorology Report, which is located in the docket for this report.) - The pilot, age 35, possessed a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter. He also held a certified flight instructor certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter. Additionally, the pilot held private pilot privileges for airplane single-engine land.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the pilot's personal logbook, together with records provided by the Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Part 135 aeromedical company that he was employed by, revealed that about 1 month prior to the accident the pilot had accumulated a total flying time of 3,299.5 hours, of which 376.9 hours were in the same make and model as the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecords also revealed that the pilot had completed his most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight review in accordance with FAR 61.56 on July 24, 2013. The pilot's most recent second-class FAA airman medical certificate was issued on February 13, 2013, with no limitations noted. - Examination of Fuel Tanks&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn August 29, 2013, under the supervision of an NTSB accident investigator, both the main and auxiliary fuel tanks, along with the instrument cluster, underwent functional testing at the facilities of Robinson Helicopter Company, Torrance, California. The results of the examination revealed the following:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain Fuel Tank&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main fuel tank, which held a total of 30.5 US gallons, was visually examined. The aluminum skins were dented and/or creased, and the mounting holes were torn away at the edges. Portions of the mounting brackets remained attached to the tank. The tank was temporarily fitted to an exemplar airframe, ensuring proper angles. The instrument cluster was wired to the fuel quantity sending unit, and a warning light was wired to the Low Fuel Warning (LFW) sending unit. With power applied, the Main Fuel Tank Operating Indicator (MFI) read EMPTY, and the LFW light illuminated. Subsequent to 30 gallons of water poured into the tank, the MFI read FULL. When 9.5 gallons was drained, the MFI continued to read FULL. A light tap on the tank resulted in the MFI dropping to just below the 3/4 mark. When the MFI was observed at the 1/2 mark, 14.34 gallons of fuel had been drained, 14.55 gallons remained. When the MFI was at the 1/4 mark, 21.28 gallons had been drained, leaving 7.61 gallons remaining. After draining 24.46 gallons, the LFW light illuminated; 4.43 gallons of fuel remained. When the MFI was at the EMPTY mark and the flow of water stopped, 28.89 gallons had been drained, leaving about 1.11 gallons of unusable liquid in the tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAuxiliary Fuel Tank&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA visual inspection of the tank, which had a capacity of 17.2 US gallons, revealed that the aluminum skins were dented, which reduced the capacity of the tank, and the mounting holes were torn away at the edges. The tank was temporarily fitted to an exemplar airframe, which insured proper angles. The instrument cluster was wired to a power source and the sending unit. When power was applied, the Auxiliary Fuel Tank Operating Indicator (AFI) read empty. Approximately 17 gallons of water was poured into the tank; the AFI needle read FULL. When the AFI was at the 1/2 mark, 8.80 gallons had been drained, with 8.2 gallons remaining. When the AFI was at the 1/4 mark, 12.91 gallons had been drained, with 4.09 gallons remaining. When the AFI was observed at the EMPTY mark and the flow of water halted, 17 gallons had been drained.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth fuel quantity sending units, the Low Fuel Sending unit, and both indicators were observed to have functioned within factory specifications. - On July 28, 2013, representatives from the NTSB, the FAA, Robinson Helicopters, and Lycoming Motors examined the helicopter at the site of the accident. The examination revealed that the helicopter had impacted heavily forested terrain in a steep nose low, right bank attitude, at an elevation of 2,915 feet msl, and subsequently came to rest on its right side, on a measured magnetic heading of 178 degrees. The impact heading could not be determined. All components necessary for flight were accounted for at the accident site. The helicopter was recovered to a secured location for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 30, 2013, under the supervision of the IIC, an examination of the engine and airframe was conducted at the facilities of a local salvage company located in Belgrade, Montana. The results of the examination failed to reveal any anomalies, which would have precluded normal operation with the helicopter.

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The purpose of the flight was to rescue a stranded hiker from the side of the mountain in dark night conditions. Once on scene, the pilot, copilot, hoist operator, and two rescue crewmembers briefed that one of the rescue crewmembers would be lowered down to the hiker and that he would then help the hiker into the strop harness. The rescuer was to remain attached to the hoist hook that was attached to his sit harness via a carbineer throughout the rescue operation, which was planned to take about 30 seconds. The hoist hook had three attachment points: a main hook, a secondary hook, and a utility eye; it is likely that the rescuer's sit harness was attached to the main hook and that the strop harness was attached to the utility eye.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hoist operator reported that, after the rescuer was lowered down to the hiker, he observed the rescuer helping the hiker into the strop harness. The hoist operator then told the pilot that he would be cleared to move the helicopter to the left and aft to clear the rock face as soon as he \"had the load.\" The hoist operator added that he saw the rescuer signal to begin the hoisting operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hiker reported that the rescuer put him into the harness while remaining attached to the hoist hook. He stated that the rescuer was moving purposefully and that his actions appeared very deliberate. The rescuer then told him to stand up, and he heard what he thought was the sound of a carabineer unclipping. It is likely that the rescuer's carabineer inadvertently became disengaged or partly disengaged from the hoist hook at this point. As the cable started moving upward, the hiker then noticed that the rescuer began rushing his actions, likely indicating that the hoist operation had begun before the rescuer was ready. As the hook was ascending, the rescuer grabbed both of the hiker's hands and placed them on the harness just below the hoist hook, which was at the hiker's eye level, and told to the hiker to hold on. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a rescue using a strop harness, the rescuer is supposed to leave the ground first. However, the hiker reported that his feet left the ground first while the rescuer remained on the ledge. The hiker then started to rotate and move away from the rock face. While moving away from the rock face, the hiker felt the rescuer grab him around his waist and then slide down his body until the rescuer fell, which resulted in his death. The hiker was hoisted into the helicopter and was uninjured. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the harness and hoist hook revealed no damage that would have precluded normal operation. The hoist's main and secondary hooks did not have self-locking safety mechanisms; this design could allow a carabineer to travel upward against the hoist hook's nonlocking safety latch and inadvertently disengage the hook. Given the hiker's statement about hearing a carbineer unclipping and the rescuer's subsequent fall, it is likely that the hoist hook inadvertently disengaged from the rescuer's harness.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  The helicopter was not equipped to allow direct intercommunications between the hoist operator and the rescuer. Therefore, once the rescuer departed the helicopter, the only effective communication between the hoist operator and the rescuer was hand signals. Although the hoist operator was using night vision goggles during the flight, the dark night conditions likely limited his detail vision and made it difficult to see the rescuer's hand signals. The lack of direct audio communications between the hoist operator and the rescuer prevented the rescuer from being able to report a problem after the hoist operation began and might have contributed to the hoist activation occurring before the rescuer was ready.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 22, 2013, about 2220 Pacific daylight time (PDT), a rescue officer was fatally injured during a rescue hoist operation from a Bell HH-1H helicopter, N233JP, near Mount Charleston, Nevada.  Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) was operating the helicopter as a public-use aircraft flight.  The flight crew consisted of two commercial pilots and three crewmen: a crew chief/hoist operator; and two rescue officers. The helicopter sustained no damage.  The local flight departed North Las Vegas, Nevada, about 2150.  Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the mission was to rescue a stranded hiker from the side of a mountain. During the hoist back to the helicopter, the rescue officer fell and was fatally injured. The civilian hiker was recovered to the helicopter via the hoist without injury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hiker reported that while hiking in the area of Mount Charleston, he became trapped on a rock outcropping. He contacted the 911 operator using his cell phone, and was told that LVMPD would send help and to remain where he was.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hiker reported that once the rescue helicopter arrived, he watched as the rescuer was lowered. After the rescuer landed on the outcropping, the hiker was directed to remain in a crouched position as the rescuer put him into the harness. The hiker stated that the rescuer was moving very purposefully and his actions appeared very deliberate. He noted that the rescuer remained attached to the hoist hook while the hiker was put into the harness. The rescuer then told him to stand up. As the hiker stood up, he heard what he thought was the sound of a carabineer unclipping. The hiker stated that he was looking up at the helicopter, and the cable started to move. He never saw the rescuer make any indications to the helicopter that they were ready to be hoisted, but he did not know what those hand signals would have been. As the hoist cable was coming up, the movements of the rescuer changed cadence. The rescuer appeared to be rushing his actions. The hiker stated that as the rescue hook was at about his eye level, the rescuer grabbed both of his hands and placed them onto the harness below the hook. With a determined look on his face, the rescuer indicated everything was going to be okay, and directed him to hold on tight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hiker stated that as his feet left the ground, he started to rotate and move away from the rock face. The rescuer was still on the ledge behind him as he was lifted off the ground. As they moved away from the rock face, he felt the rescuer grab him around the waist. The hiker felt the rescuer sliding down his body until the rescuer fell away. The lift continued, and the hiker was hoisted into the helicopter. Subsequently they landed, and he was taken off the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPILOT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 45-year-old pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, rotorcraft, and instrument airplane and rotorcraft.  The pilot held a certified flight instructor (CFI) certificate with ratings for helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a second-class medical certificate issued on July 31, 2012. It had no limitations or waivers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had a total flight time of 2,754 hours, with 100 hours in the last 90 days, and 35 in the last 30 days.  He had 90 hours in the accident helicopter make and model.  He completed a biennial flight review on January 10, 2012.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that he had 145 hours of rescue flight time, which included training time. He had completed 38 rescues in his 2 years as a rescue pilot for LVMPD.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was interviewed following the accident and related that he was assigned as the pilot-in-command of Rescue Air-6. He was dispatched with a co-pilot and three rescue crew members to the area of Mount Charleston to rescue a hiker who was trapped on a ledge.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, co-pilot, left-side rescue crew member, and the hoist operator were all utilizing Night Vision Goggles (NVG) during the rescue operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnce on scene, the crews briefed that they would lower the rescuer down to the hiker, and use the strop harness to recover the hiker. The rescuer briefed that he would remain attached to the hoist during the operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter the rescuer had been lowered to the hiker, and before being hoisted up, the hoist operator advised the pilot that as soon as they had the load he would be cleared to move to the left away from the mountain face.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nShortly after the rescuer signaled to begin the hoist, as the helicopter was moving to the left, the hoist operator stated on the intercom that the rescuer had fallen. The pilot related that the hoist operation continued as the hiker was recovered into the helicopter. After a few minutes of trying to locate the fallen rescuer, the pilot landed the helicopter at the staging area, which had been set up for the rescue, and off loaded the hiker.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot and crew made one more attempt to locate the rescuer before another flight crew arrived and took over the search and ultimately the recovery operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCREW CHIEF/HOIST OPERATOR-(HOIST)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe crew chief/hoist operator's assignment was to operate the hoist from the right side of the helicopter and to assist the pilot in maintaining proper clearance from the mountainside.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hoist operator related that once they arrived on scene, an assessment was done after they saw where the hiker was located. The rescuer suggested that they use the strop harness, and the rescuer stated he would remain attached to the hoist hook during the rescue, which was estimated to take about 30 seconds. After configuring the rescuer with the strop harness, which was attached to the hoist hook, the rescuer was lowered down to the hiker.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hoist operator could not directly see what the rescuer did as his back was to the hoist operator, but the rescuer's movements were consistent with the rescuer putting the strop harness onto the hiker. The hoist operator was verbalizing to the flight crew what he was observing using the helicopter intercom. During this time, the hoist operator informed the pilot that as soon as the pilot \"had the load,\" he was cleared to move left and aft to clear the rock face.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hoist operator stated he saw the rescuer signal to begin the hoisting operation. The hoist operator watched the hiker, who was facing the helicopter, and the rescuer, who had his back to the helicopter. The hiker was observed holding onto the strop harness and looking up at the helicopter. The rescuer was relaxed and looking up at the hoist operator, just like a typical rescue. As the hiker and the rescuer lifted off, they started to rotate, which is normal as the hook can free spin. The hoist operator saw the rescuer was positioned a little bit higher on the hook and was above and behind the hiker's left shoulder. As they came off the ground, the hoist operator cleared the helicopter away from the mountainside. The hiker was closest to the mountainside, and the rescuer was closest to the drop off. As he was operating the hoist, the hoist operator felt the weight on the cable change, and he watched as the rescuer fell.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSEARCH AND RESCUE OFFICER-(SAR Officer)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe SAR officer's assignment was as the left side crew member. As such, he helped with whatever was needed inside the helicopter and monitored clearance on the left side of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe SAR officer related that most hoist rescue operations would be accomplished using a standard body harness, which is a pre-sewn harness with quick-attach buckles. Generally the rescuer would be lowered to the victim, detach from the hoist hook, and signal for the hook to be recovered. The helicopter would then move away to allow the rescuer to communicate and harness the victim. The rescuer, when ready, would signal to the crew, and the helicopter would return and lower the hook to the rescuer. The rescuer would attach the hook to the victim who would then be hoisted to the helicopter. Then the hook would be returned to the rescuer, and he would be hoisted to the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBecause of the location of the hiker, the rescue crew decided it would be better if the rescuer remained attached to the hoist hook and used the strop harness. The strop harness is like a horse collar with a crotch strap. The strop harness is normally used for water rescues, but they felt it would allow for a rapid recovery. The pilot agreed that he could hoist two people since they had the left side SAR officer to counterbalance the load.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe SAR officer did not take notice of how the rescuer and the strop were attached to the hoist hook. However, he stated that the normal configuration that was used by LVMPD was that the rescuer was attached to the large hook and the strop harness was attached to the small eyelet at the base of the hoist hook with a locking carabineer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe SAR officer could not see the hoist operation from his side of the helicopter. He stated everything appeared normal until the hoist operator reported that the rescuer had fallen. At that time, the SAR officer looked under the helicopter from the left side and saw the rescuer tumbling down the mountainside.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was a Bell HH1H, serial number 70-2478. The operator reported that the helicopter had a total airframe time of 6,630 hours at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was being operated by LVMPD under the public-use exemption. The helicopter was equipped with night vision lighting as LVMPD received it from the military. The helicopter was not certified for night vision goggle operations. Nor was it required to be certified per Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with the Lucas Aerospace Cargo System, Part number (PN)-527KES; the boom assembly - Goodrich Corporation, PN-82402ASSY42305-300 and the winch assembly - Goodrich Corporation, PN -00462ASSY42305-103. The hoist hook, PN 42305-283, was the original hook that was supplied with the hoist system when purchased and installed by LVMPD.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPost-accident examination of the hoist, winch, and harness connections revealed no abnormalities.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hoist hook, PN 42305-283, when originally installed with the hook kit was identified as PN 42315-785, and has the following ratings per UTC Aerospace Systems, the distributor for the hoist system: The main hook was rated for 3,000 pounds; the secondary hook was rated for 1,000 pounds; and the eyelet was rated for 1,500 pounds. The hoist was rated for 600 pounds, and had been designed for a 1,800 pound limit and a 2,700 pound ultimate load.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident hoist hook had gates to prevent disengagement of the load from either the main hook or the smaller hook. The gates were not locking gates, which would prevent a dynamic rollout occurrence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest official weather observation station was North Las Vegas Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada (VGT), which was 22 nautical miles (nm) east of the accident site.  The elevation of the weather observation station was 2,205 feet mean sea level (msl). An aviation routine weather report (METAR) for VGT was issued at 2153 PDT.  It stated: Wind from 110 degrees at 6 knots; visibility 10 miles; skies clear; temperature 33/91 degrees Celsius/Fahrenheit; dew point 14/57 degrees Celsius/Fahrenheit; and altimeter 29.93 inches of Mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCOMMUNICATIONS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter was not equipped to allow direct intercommunications between the hoist operator and the rescuer. The only direct communication available was by hand signals.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration regulation Part 133.45(e)-(2) requires direct radio intercommunications among required crewmembers. However, LVMPD, being a public-use agency, was exempt from this regulation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Clark County Coroner completed an autopsy of the rescuer on July 23, 2013, and determined the cause of death to be a result of multiple blunt force injuries due to a fall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators examined the helicopter and the hoist system at the hangar facilities of the LVMPD, on August 8, 2013. The examination revealed no mechanical anomalies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rescuer's harness and the hoist hook were sent to the NTSB materials laboratory for analysis. A copy of the report is attached to the accident docket. No anomalies were noted in the report.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National SAR Academy Training Manual, dated 10-23-2013, Page 46 Described UNINTENTIONAL DISENGAGEMENT (Dynamic Rollout) as follows:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe inadvertent release of a load or \"rollout\" from a hoist hook can occur when a carabineer or attachment D-ring travels upward, through possible load relief, and rides up against the safety latch of the hoist hook. This reversal up over the point of the hook puts pressure on a non-locking safety latch, which can self-release the load. A fatal accident occurred in December 1995, when a rescue strop separated from the hoist hook of an Australian Navy S-70B-2 helicopter. The hoist hook was relieved of the weight of the load, when it touched the ground before being hoisted up, thereby permitting the connection point to become dangerously oriented across the non-locking gate of the hoist hook. This dangerous phenomenon can be prevented through the use of attachment rings, which do not permit reversing over the point of the hook, and the use of auto-locking hoist hooks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nQUICK STROP&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Lifesaving Systems Corp. Quick Strop Model 214 is placed under the arms, around the back, or over the head of a subject. It can be deployed quickly around a subject. The quick strop has a friction slide that can snug the strop around the subject. There is a length-adjustable strap that is folded into a pocket on the back of the quick strop. The strap terminates in a snap hook. This strap is routed between the survivor's legs and then clipped into the friction slide when the survivor is unconscious.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNote: The United States Coast Guard required the use of the crotch strap when an unconscious, unresponsive, or incapacitated subject while being hoisted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCaution: Deploying a rescue strop to a subject without the aid of a rescuer was not recommended. Rescue strop recovery without proper application had resulted in subjects falling out of the device during extraction with fatal consequences.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen a rescuer has deployed a rescue strop on a subject and is beginning to be extracted, the rescuer will be elevated above the subject. This would mean the rescuer would leave the ground first and the subject would be a few feet below, depending on the length of the rescue strop.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs a result of this accident and the subsequent investigation, the LVMPD has modified their aviation program and a copy of the current changes as of June 30, 2014, and are included in the accident docket. Some of the changes made were as follows:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident rescue hook was replaced with a rescue hook with a self-locking safety mechanism, which requires the rescue personnel to manually disengage the locking safety before the hook gate can open. The locking rescue hook will prevent an unintentional disengagement event.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe implementation of standardized hand signals between rescue personnel and air crew members and the use of new two-way communication equipment between the hoist operator and the rescue personnel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTo improve visibility all SAR personnel are now wearing high visibility clothing, and the use of reflective tape on helmets, and to utilize chemical light sticks and helmet lights during night operations. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter pilot flew inbound to a seismic survey location hoisting a basket load with a long-line rope. The pilot overshot the intended drop site, and the basket load and long-line impacted the ground after the pilot likely initiated a load release. The helicopter then entered a right bank, followed by a steep left bank, and subsequently impacted the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter revealed evidence consistent with a loss of hydraulic fluid from the flight control system due to a hydraulic leak of a check valve fitting near the tail rotor servo. As the pilot approached the survey location, the loss of hydraulic pressure most likely resulted in very-high collective control forces and pilot-induced oscillations. The director of maintenance stated that the pilot and a mechanic were aware of the hydraulic fluid leak and had ordered replacement parts; however, they had not yet been installed. He stated that they did not expect the leak to cause a significant issue. Thus, it is likely that they did not foresee the leak causing a significant flight hazard.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 16, 2013, about 0955 mountain daylight time, a Tamarack UH-1H helicopter, N775AR, was substantially damaged after a loss of control and ground impact near Dove Creek, Colorado. The pilot, the sole occupant, was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to BVDS Incorporated and operated by Billings Flying Service under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 during a seismic survey operation. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight, which departed without a flight plan from a staging area near Dove Creek, Colorado, about 0953.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to ground witnesses at the survey location, the pilot flew inbound to their location from the left seat, hoisting a basket load with a long line rope. The pilot overshot the intended drop site and the basket load impacted the ground, followed immediately by the 150 foot long line falling straight down onto the basket load. At about the same time, the helicopter entered into a right bank, followed by a left bank. The helicopter subsequently impacted the ground in a steep left bank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 27, held a commercial pilot certificate with airplane single and multiengine land, airplane instrument, and rotorcraft-helicopter ratings. The pilot also held a flight instructor certificate, with airplane single and multi-engine and rotorcraft-helicopter ratings, as well as a mechanic airframe and power plant certificate. On June 24, 2013, the pilot was issued a Class 2 medical certificate, with no restrictions. A review of the pilot's flight records indicated that he had logged over 5,000 hours total flight time, with over 1,800 hours in the make and model of the accident helicopter. During the seven days prior to the accident, the pilot had flown the accident helicopter about 15 flight hours. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter, originally manufactured in 1965 by Bell Helicopter, Inc., was equipped with a Lycoming T53-L-13B engine, composite main rotor blades and BLR Aerodynamic Solutions Tailboom Strakes and Fast Fin System. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified the helicopter to be flown from the left seat and issued a restricted type certificate (TC) to Tamarack Helicopters, Inc., which authorized agricultural, forest/wildlife, and external load operations. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing extensive maintenance and refurbishment by Billings Flying Service, the helicopter was released for maintenance test flights on June 5, 2013. At the time of the accident, the helicopter had flown a total of 14,798 hours, which included 41 flight hours after completion of the refurbishment. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was operating about 700 pounds (lbs.) below performance limit capability for a 50 foot out of ground (OGE) hover as the pilot approached the survey location. The basic helicopter weight, as documented in the Form B aircraft weighing record, was 5,240 lbs. Total helicopter weight was about 8,000 lbs., based on an estimated 2,000 lbs. basket load, 500 lbs. fuel load, 180 lbs. pilot weight, and 80 lbs. of miscellaneous tools/personal gear. As calculated with the FAA-approved operator manual supplement hover chart, the maximum weight for a 50 foot OGE hover was about 8,700 lbs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe weather observation station at Cortez Municipal Airport (KCEZ), Cortez, Colorado, located about 21 miles to the south of the accident site, reported the following conditions at 0953: wind 300 degrees at 4 knots, visibility 10 miles, overcast clouds at 8,500 feet, temperature 21 degrees Celsius (C), dew point 12 C, altimeter setting 30.25. Density altitude (DA) conditions at the accident site location were about 9,500 feet, based on an accident site elevation of 7,630 feet and a standard temperature lapse rate from the KCEZ observation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted into relatively flat, bush covered terrain and was found resting on its left side. The main fuselage had significant crushing to the nose section and left side. The skids exhibited bending to the left forward crosstube consistent with a left bank nose down attitude at ground impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth composite main rotor blades were attached to the main rotor hub through blade bolts and drag braces. Each blade exhibited damage consistent with ground contact while rotating. The main rotor hub was intact except that the pitch horn from one main rotor blade had separated from its main rotor grip consistent with ground impact forces. The mast remained attached to the main rotor hub assembly and to the transmission. The main transmission chip detector was removed and exhibited no debris or chips. No pre-impact anomalies were observed with the main rotor hub, composite blades, or mast. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight controls and hydraulics system exhibited extensive damage from impact. The helicopter was equipped with dual flight controls. The pilot was flying from the left seat, with instrumentation on the left pilot door for external load operations. The pilot's cyclic stick and collective stick exhibited fractures consistent with overload near their mounting locations. The rotating controls exhibited continuity to the stabilizer bar and to each pitch change link and pitch horn. The hydraulic pump was removed from the hydraulic drive quill on the sump case and the splined driveshaft was intact. The splined driveshaft was rotated with pliers and minimal resistance occurred. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine examination revealed compressor shroud metal spray on the aft side of the 2nd stage power turbine, consistent with operation at the time of impact. Evidence of engine rotation at the time of impact included rotational scoring and tearing on the inner diameter of the particle separator housing assembly, as well as first stage axial compressor blades either broken from the drive hub or exhibiting rotational scoring/leading edge damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA follow on airframe examination was conducted at the salvage location. The left and right hydraulic servos were intact and the frame mounts exhibited multiple fractures consistent with overload. Due to the airframe structure damage, many hydraulic lines were fractured due to overload forces. No chafed hydraulic lines were observed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic switch was observed in the ON position. This hydraulic switch, located on the far right side of center pedestal, is out of immediate reach for a pilot flying from the left seat.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLight bulb filaments from the cockpit main annunciator panel, instrument panel annunciators, and pilot's auxiliary annunciator were examined for filament stretch with a USB connected microscope. Both of the bulb filaments for the hydraulic pressure annunciator light, as well as the single bulb filament for the auxiliary master caution light, appeared to be stretched. The remainder of the annunciator system bulb filaments did not appear to be stretched. Filament stretch of the hydraulic pressure annunciator and auxiliary master caution light bulbs was confirmed by the Bell Helicopter engineering laboratory.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral hydraulic fluid drips were observed on hydraulic lines. A hydraulic check valve near the tail rotor control actuator servo could be rotated by hand between solid hydraulic lines and fittings. The hydraulic check valve and proximate hydraulic pressure line were intact and connected to undistorted walls in the aft belly compartment. In this same compartment, several rags were found soaked with hydraulic oil. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe external cargo hook was tested and responded accordingly when commanded to release both electrically and mechanically. The cargo hook electrical switch and manual cargo hook release could not be tested, due to damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 27, 2013, an autopsy was performed on the pilot by a forensics pathologist at the Ertel Mortuary, Cortez, Colorado, as authorized by the Dolores County Coroner. The cause of death was attributed to blunt force injuries. The FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology tests on the pilot. No carbon monoxide, ethanol, or drugs were detected during testing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was wearing a headset, vice a helmet, during the accident sequence. The left seat, which the pilot was flying from, was equipped with a seat belt and shoulder harness. The seat belt right side attachment fitting was fractured. The shoulder harness was not connected to the seat belt and the straps were not restrained within the guide at the top of the seat.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHydraulic system components were examined and tested at the Bell Helicopter engineering laboratory, with oversight by FAA and NTSB personnel. Hydraulic bench testing revealed that the right cyclic, left cyclic, and collective hydraulic servos operated normally and did not exhibit evidence that would preclude normal operation prior to the accident. Testing of the hydraulic control panel, filter, and pump revealed no anomalies or leakage. Of the various hydraulic fixed lines and flexible hoses that were in a condition that allowed for testing, none exhibited evidence of leakages with the exception of two components: a leak was observed with one hydraulic return line near the transmission, as well as a leak to the hydraulic check valve/pressure line to the tail rotor control actuator servo near bulkhead station 211.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic return line located near the transmission had 45 degree shear laps in the flareless fitting due to removed tubing material that allowed the sleeve to lap over itself during tightening. It could not be determined if ground impact opened one of the sleeve laps, or if a noticeable 10 degree bend in the tube adjacent to the leak was impact-related.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic check valve exhibited longitudinal cracks at both threaded ends. The cracks were a result of stress corrosion cracking, as evidenced by intergranular features, crack branching and corrosion. No material discrepancies were noted. Evidence of Teflon tape was present at the outlet end of the threads. Teflon tape is commonly used in plumbing applications to seal threads from leaking, but is not an approved material to be used with the hydraulic system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic line containing the hydraulic check valve near the tail rotor servo was pressure tested. The check valve exhibited a leak at a rate of about 100 cubic centimeters (cc) per minute at both 850 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) and 1,000 psig. At 1,000 psig, when the line was slightly cocked, the valve exhibited a leakage rate of about 300 cc in 45 seconds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic system has a total capacity of about 8 pints, including fluid within the reservoir, servos, and lines. The hydraulic reservoir has a capacity of about 5.3 pints. One pint is equivalent to about 473 cc.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEST FLIGHT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn July 1988, US Army Aviation Engineering Flight Activity completed an airworthiness and flight characteristics evaluation report for the UH-1H with composite main rotor blades (CMRB) installed. Included in the report were the following conclusions:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n \"Hydraulic system failure characteristics were qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated … during approaches to running landings. A slight nose-down pitching moment upon failure was controlled by an approximate 15 pound aft longitudinal force. Increased right lateral control forces coupled with the onset of some control feedback required moderate pilot compensation to prevent pilot-induced oscillation (PIO) tendencies, causing an increase in control activity.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"The hydraulic system failure characteristics of the UH-1H helicopter with the hub spring and CMRB installed are acceptable; however, high altitude operations could be compromised due to the high collective control force encountered without hydraulics assist, thereby restricting control travel.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the accident, without FAA or NTSB awareness, two pilots from Billings Flying Service conducted an informal UH-1H flight test at high altitude. The flying pilot notified the NTSB of his findings during an interview. During a simulated long line profile with the hydraulics system turned off, the flying pilot observed a high amount of force was required to apply collective. While making his \"hard pull\" of the collective with his left arm, the pilot observed that he had a tendency to \"brace\" himself and push the cyclic to the right, causing a right bank. This tendency to bank right was not immediately recognized, since he was leaning left to simulate sighting for a long line operation. As he attempted to return to a level attitude (with the hydraulics system turned off) he overcorrected and entered into nearly 90 degrees of left bank. The pilot was very startled by the dramatic left bank and immediately directed the other pilot in the right seat to restore hydraulics system pressure to assist with recovery of the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMAINTENANCE INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter mechanic stated that hydraulic leaks had been a long-term challenge with the accident helicopter and that most of the hydraulic lines had been replaced as the helicopter was rebuilt and brought up to certification standards. While deployed to the Dove Creek location, a hydraulic line had been replaced six days prior to the accident, due to a leak near the transmission filter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanic, director of maintenance at home station, and accident pilot were aware of a slow, \"weeping\" hydraulic leak in the aft belly of the fuselage, but did not foresee the leak causing a significant issue. Replacement components for the hydraulic system near the leak, to include hydraulic lines, fittings, and a check valve, had been requested from home station, and were expected to arrive to the Dove Creek location within days of the accident. Information concerning a weeping hydraulic leak was not entered into the maintenance records.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the day prior to the accident, the pilot told the mechanic that the cyclic appeared \"notchy\", as if it would \"bump\" a little during movement. The pilot thought the cyclic issue may have been associated with winds. Based on the pilot's comment about cyclic, the mechanic inspected for loose hardware, the main rotor hub, main rotor dampeners, and pitch change linkages on the controls in the vicinity of the swashplate. He did not observe any anomalies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanic stated that he added one or two cups of hydraulic fluid to the reservoir within a day or two of the accident. On the morning of the accident, the mechanic noticed the check valve fitting was not tight. He tightened several fittings in the surrounding area, utilized Teflon tape in an attempt to help the check valve fittings 'grab' more effectively, and used rags to soak up hydraulic fluid in the aft belly of the main fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBillings Flying Service personnel described the operating environment at the Dove Creek survey location as 'tense'. About three days prior to the accident, an owner of Billings Flying Service terminated a contract pilot after the accident pilot informed the owner of this pilot's aggressive flying at the Dove Creek location. Following the termination, the accident pilot informed the owner that survey personnel were dissatisfied with losing the other pilot and blamed the accident pilot for the termination. According to the owner and the mechanic, survey personnel had 'timed' how long the accident pilot was taking to perform long line operations. A survey supervisor had informed the owner that the accident pilot was taking \"50% longer\" than the terminated pilot in performing these operations. The owner stated that the accident pilot was very concerned with losing the survey contract and told him that the work environment felt hostile. The mechanic stated that he also felt pressure to ensure flights were completed. The director of maintenance stated that the accident pilot and mechanic were concerned that any \"maintenance down time\" on the helicopter would result in a contract penalty. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn June 19, 2013, at 0812 central daylight time, a Bell 47G-3B-1 single-engine helicopter, N5024N, impacted a residential garage while maneuvering near Maplewood, Minnesota. The commercial pilot, who was the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries. The helicopter was destroyed by impact and post-crash fire. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Scott's Helicopter Services, Inc., Le Sueur, Minnesota, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 137 as an aerial application flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated without a flight plan. The flight originated from a remote staging area at 0755.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator and global positioning system data, the helicopter departed Flying Cloud Airport, Minneapolis, Minnesota, at 0716, and flew to a remote staging area near Maplewood to be loaded with a mosquito control dry chemical. The helicopter was loaded with 640 pounds of dry chemical and departed the staging area. Based on a map provided by the operator, the pilot was planning to apply chemical to four designated areas. The GPS data showed the helicopter maneuvered around two of the designated areas, consistent with chemical application, and was then transitioning to the north-northeast. While flying north-northeast, the helicopter maintained a level altitude of approximately 200-300 feet above ground level. For the last 30 seconds of the flight, the GPS data showed the groundspeed gradually increased from 49 knots to 67 knots. The last recorded GPS position showed the helicopter at 300 feet above ground level, a groundspeed of 67 knots, on a heading of 15 degrees, and located approximately 400 feet south of the accident location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness observed the helicopter applying the chemical at one of the designated areas, which was located just south of the staging area. The helicopter was then observed to depart that location. Additional witnesses, who were located near the accident location, observed the helicopter traveling south to north near the accident. Prior to the accident, the helicopter was observed to lose altitude, turn or roll to the left, and descend. Witnesses then lost sight of the helicopter behind some residential houses. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with rototcraft-helicopter and instrument helicopter ratings. The pilot's most recent second class medical certificate was issued on December 11, 2012, with no restrictions or limitations. The pilot's most recent flight review was completed by Scott's Helicopter Services, Inc., on April 23, 2013.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator and pilot records, the pilot had accumulated approximately 2,794 flight hours, of which 2,778 hours were in helicopters, and 332 hours in the make and model of the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had previously worked for Scott's Helicopter Services, Inc., from April to October in 2009 conducting mosquito control, pipeline patrol, and electronic news gathering (ENG) operations. From December 2009 until April 2013, the pilot was employed in the helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) industry. The pilot returned to Scott's Helicopter Services, Inc., in April 2013, and since returning, the pilot had flown approximately 100 flight hours in the make and model accident helicopter performing mosquito control operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to members of the pilot's family, the pilot was in excellent health and physical condition. In the days preceding the accident, the pilot was well rested and had no medical or health issues.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to another company pilot, who interacted with the accident pilot on the morning of the accident, the accident pilot arrived at the Flying Cloud hangar approximately 0620. The accident pilot made some coffee, checked the weather, and both pilots preflighted their helicopters. After departure from the Flying Cloud airport, the other company pilot had no further communication with the accident pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter was a Bell 47G-3B-1 helicopter, serial number 6601, and equipped with a Rolls Royce 250-C10D turboshaft engine per a supplemental type certificate. The helicopter was issued a special airworthiness certificate in the restricted category for the purpose of Agricultural and Pest Control on April 19, 1991, and registered to the owner on June 10, 1994.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the aircraft records and information obtained from the operator, the most recent annual and 100-hour inspections were completed on December 14, 2012, at a total airframe time of 5,340.3 hours and a total engine time of 2,948.8 hours. In addition, the 200-, 300-, and 400-hour airframe inspections and 200-, 300- engine inspections were completed at that date.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0753, the Saint Paul Downtown Airport, Saint Paul, Minnesota, automated surface observing system, located 4 miles southwest of the accident site, reported the wind from 140 degrees at 8 knots, visibility 10 miles, sky clear, temperature 18 degrees Celsius, dew point 13 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter of 30.07 inches of Mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRADAR AND COMMUNICATIONS INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no recorded radar or communications information regarding the accident helicopter or pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted a residential garage, came to rest on its left side on a measured magnetic heading of 275 degree, and the cockpit and fuselage were consumed by post-impact fire. Helicopter debris, which consisted of windscreen and miscellaneous fiberglass sections, was distributed in an area surrounding the helicopter approximately 100 feet in diameter. Ground scars were noted under the helicopter and other impact marks, consistent with the main rotor blades were noted on the residential concrete driveway and garage roof. The residential garage was partially consumed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth main rotor blades remained attached to the hub and displayed leading edge crush damage, bending, twisting, and blade fragmentation. Mechanical continuity was confirmed from the engine, through the transmission and main rotor blades. The tail rotor drive shaft was disconnected from the engine. The main rotor pitch links were intact; however, continuity could not be established from the cockpit controls as multiple control tubes and linkage were consumed by fire. The main rotor clutch assembly was intact, and engaged and disengaged with no anomalies noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom remained partially attached to the fuselage. The tail rotor drive system was bent and distorted, and continuity could not be established due to separated drive system components. The damage to the tail rotor system was consistent with impact damage. The tail rotor blades remained attached to the hub and gearbox. One tail rotor blade was bent span-wise approximately 45 degrees near the blade grip and one blade was bent 90 degrees at the grip. Mechanical continuity was confirmed to the tail rotor blades through the gearbox and pitch control assembly. The tail rotor pitch control cables were found separated, and the separations displayed broomstraw features consistent with tensile overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained partially attached to the fuselage and displayed thermal damage. The left engine mounts were both fractured, and the right engine mounts were bent and fractured. The engine exhibited damage to the left side. The exhaust collector and associated ductwork were crushed. The engine fuel spray nozzle was removed to facilitate borescope examination of the gas-generator turbine. Inspection revealed no evidence of turbine distress, erosion, or failure. Metal splatter was noted on the 1st stage turbine nozzle shield. The fuel spray nozzle was disassembled and the internal screen was clear of debris. The upper magnetic chip detector was removed and inspected. The chip detector was clear of debris. The lower magnetic chip detector was removed and inspected. The chip detector showed a small amount of metallic paste and carbonized oil, and was free of metallic debris. The engine oil filter was removed. The filter contained some carbonized oil and was free of metallic debris. The engine was removed for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel tanks remained partially attached to the fuselage and displayed thermal damage. The helicopter landing skids were bent, deformed, and fragmented. The chemical hopper assemblies were separated, fragmented, and partially consumed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter flight and engine instruments were consumed by fire and no recognizable information was able to be determined. Annunciator panel light bulbs were removed and examined. The bulbs displayed no filament stretch. The collective throttle was found in the open position. The cockpit seats and restraints were consumed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA portable global positioning system (GPS) and AG-NAV GPS unit were located in the wreckage and sent to the NTSB Vehicle Recorders Laboratory, Washington, DC, for examination and data extraction. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn June 19, 2013, at the Ramsey County Office of the Medical Examiner, St. Paul, Minnesota, an autopsy was performed on the pilot. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological analysis of specimens of the pilot was performed at the FAA Toxicology and Accident Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Samples were tested for cyanide, ethanol, volatiles, and drugs. None were found to be present. Carbon monoxide test could not be performed due to insufficient specimen for analysis.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEST AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAG-NAV GPS Unit&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AG-NAV GPS unit was examined by the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory. The unit is a GPS navigation system designed for aerial applications. The unit contains a 6.5 inch LCD display with data logging features. The system is designed to interface with other GPS engines and AG-NAV products, such as, Automatic Flow Controller and Variable Rate Application for aerial applications. The device can also interface with FAA tower obstacle data to show the pilot nearby obstacles on its moving map and will provide the pilot with warnings of incoming obstacles with messages and aural alerts. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn exterior examination revealed the AG-NAV unit sustained major fire damage. An interior examination revealed the CF card that contained the flight log data was melted to the unit and could not be recovered.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGarmin GPSMAP 296 Unit&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Garmin GPSMAP 296 is a hand-portable GPS unit equipped with a detachable antenna, a 256 color display, built-in base map, and an internal Jeppesen aviation database. The unit is capable of storing date, route of flight, and flight time information for up to 50 individual flights in the form of a flight log. A detailed track log, including latitude, longitude, date, time, and GPS altitude information for an unspecified number of points, is stored within the unit whenever the receiver has a lock on the GPS navigation signal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn exterior examination revealed the unit sustained minor impact damage to the casing. The unit powered on normally, and the data was extracted using the manufacturer's recommended procedures. The data extracted from the unit included 3 sessions all from the accident day, and consisted of 279 total data points. The accident flight was recorded starting at 0755:24 and ending at 0812:01, which consisted of 179 data points. The flight from Flying Cloud Airport to the remote staging field was recorded starting at 0716:28 and ending at 0744:51.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn November 5, 2013, at the facilities of Rolls Royce, the engine was examined and disassembled under the supervision of the NTSB. Representatives from the Federal Aviation Administration, Scott's Helicopter Service, Inc., and Rolls Royce were also present during the examination. Examination of the 1st stage compressor blades showed foreign object damage with tearing and bending noted in the direction opposite of normal compressor rotation. The compressor could not be rotated due to the melting and deformation of the polymer lining within the compressor case halves. Due to damage to the pneumatic tubing, an air pressure check of the engine control systems could not completed. The fuel control unit's mounting lugs and drive shaft were fractured. The stub remnant of the drive shaft could be rotated by hand. A microscope examination of the fractured drive shaft showed the drive shaft fractured in linear overload. The engine-driven fuel pump was removed and inspected. The fuel pump drive shaft was rotated by hand. Metal splatters were noted on the 1st stage turbine nozzle shield, which was consistent with impact damage to the compressor. The gas generator turbine was rotated by hand, with no evidence of binding or drag from either the bearings or blade tip rub. The power turbine shaft to pinion gear coupling exhibited a 2-3 mm bulge at its midpoint, consistent with rotational contact and frictional heating between the coupling and inner shaft. The contact was consistent with the bending movement of the turbine during impact. Rotational witness marks were noted within the 4th stage turbine air seal. The turbine-to-compressor coupling exhibited circumferential scoring on the outer surface. The compressor diffuser scroll was removed and the front diffuser was examined. The front diffuser exhibited rotational scoring consistent with being contacted by the centrifugal compressor rotor during engine operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeight and Balance&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the helicopter's most recent weight and balance form revealed it had a useful load of 1,061 lbs. The pilot weighed approximately 163 lbs. The estimated fuel on board was 35 gallons, and estimated chemical was 600 lbs. The weight of the pilot, fuel, and chemical would result in the helicopter being about 54 lbs less than the maximum gross weight of 2,950 lbs. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The emergency medical service helicopter had been parked for more than an hour on a paved road next to a hospital. Immediately before takeoff during the predeparture safety briefing, the pilot discussed with the medical crew the 20-ft-tall metal lamp post to the helicopter's immediate left front. However, the pilot did not mention the 40-ft-tall metal lamp post that was 175 ft ahead of the helicopter and on the left side of the roadway. During takeoff, while traveling forward and following the center of the 25-ft-wide paved road, the helicopter's rotating main rotor blades impacted the 40-ft-tall lamp post about 24 ft above its base. The pilot was unable to maintain control of the helicopter, and the helicopter impacted the ground and came to rest on its right side about 230 ft from the takeoff point. The pilot reported that during the takeoff and before impact, he never saw the 40-ft-tall lamp post.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn June 11, 2013, at 1830 central daylight time, N935EM, a Eurocopter AS350B2 helicopter, operating as EagleMed 35, was substantially damaged after impacting terrain during takeoff at Choctaw Indian Hospital Heliport (OK35), Talihina, Oklahoma. The medical patient was fatally injured, the flight nurse was seriously injured, and the pilot and flight paramedic sustained minor injuries. The helicopter was registered to JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., Columbus, Ohio, and was operated by EagleMed, LLC, Wichita, Kansas. Day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident and a company visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan had been filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) flight. The helicopter was destined for St. Francis Hospital Heliport (4OK3), Tulsa, Oklahoma.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen EagleMed 35 arrived at OK35 another helicopter, Life Flight 4, had just landed and was occupying the single space helipad surface. EagleMed 35 landed and shut down on the asphalt surface of a road adjacent to the helipad, and about 103 feet northwest from the helipad. Life Flight 4 departed at 1728 and EagleMed 35 remained parked on the road for the next hour.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe patient was loaded onto a stretcher on the left side of the cabin and the medical crewmembers were seated in their forward facing seats behind the pilot and behind the stretcher patient. According to the pilot, he began a normal takeoff from a hover, and he intended to follow the center of the road in a westbound direction. During takeoff the left side of the rotating main rotor blades (MRB) impacted a metal light pole on the left side of the road about 175 feet west from the takeoff position. Control of the helicopter was lost and the helicopter came to rest on its right side about 230 feet from the takeoff position. A small postimpact fire ensued. The fire was finally extinguished by several persons using handheld fire extinguishers. Police officers on-duty at the helipad and numerous other first responders from the hospital immediately came to the scene and aided in the recovery efforts of the patient and the flight nurse. The engine, which had continued to run, was shut down with assistance from the first responders.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot reported that during the time he was parked on the road he had three times conducted a walk around inspection of the helicopter. During his pre-departure safety briefing with the medical crew the pilot had discussed the 20 foot tall lamp post to their immediate left front, but he was not then aware of the 40 foot tall light pole. The pilot reported that during the take-off and before impact he never saw the 40 foot tall light pole.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 32, held a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) commercial pilot certificate with ratings for rotorcraft - helicopter, and instrument helicopter. The pilot also held an unrestricted FAA second-class medical certificate, issued on August 14, 2012, and an FAA flight instructor certificate with a rating in only rotorcraft – helicopter. The flight instructor certificate had expired on July 31, 2007.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the operator's records, statements from the pilot, and FAA aeromedical certification records, showed that the pilot had an estimated total pilot experience in helicopters of about 3,560 hours, with a total of about 88 hours in AS-350 helicopters. He was working a 12 hour daytime schedule that began about 0700 and he had flown two previous flights that day for a total of 1.9 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the operator's pilot training records showed that the pilot completed the operator's FAA approved training program and his initial pilot competency check on August 9, 2012. He was then assigned as a pilot-in-command for AS-350 helicopters. On April 27, 2013, the pilot completed night vision goggle (NVG) ground and flight training, and a satisfactory NVG competency flight check.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe single-engine helicopter, N935EM, serial number 7427, was manufactured in 2012. It was powered by a 712-shaft horsepower Turbomeca Arriel 1D1 engine, serial number 19487. Review of the maintenance documents revealed that the last inspection was a continuous airworthiness inspection that occurred on May 21, 2013 at a total airframe time and total engine time of 470.0 hours. According to company maintenance records, and the cockpit mounted Hobbs meter reading, at the time of the accident, the helicopter had accrued an additional 52.5 hours for a total of 552.5 airframe hours and engine hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an Appareo Vision 1000 recorder which was originally installed on August, 21, 2012. It was mounted on the cockpit ceiling and was designed to record a cockpit video image and included provisions for recording 2-tracks of audio and an internal GPS receiver designed to record the GPS flight track.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nManufacturer's records noted that the Appareo unit was returned for repair on March 4, 2013, with the following note: \"Replaced broken P1 connector\". (power connector) \"Backup kernel corrupt. Reflashed kernel\". The manufacturer's records indicated that the unit was functioning after being repaired.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the operator's weight and balance calculations and the patient's weight showed that the helicopter had begun the take-off from OK35 at an estimated weight of about 4,840 pounds. FAA data shows the helicopter's maximum allowable operating weight is 4,961 pounds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest official weather reporting station was at Robert S. Kerr Airport (KRKR), Poteau, Oklahoma, located 28 miles northeast from the accident location, At 1835 the Automated Surface Observation System at KRKR, reported wind from 180 degrees at 10 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear skies, temperature minus 33 degrees Celsius (C), dew point 23 degrees C, with an altimeter setting of 29.93 inches of Mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPhotographs of the accident scene taken immediately after impact showed smoke from the postimpact fire was being blown to the west by wind from the east.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nData from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed that, at the accident location, at 1830, the altitude of the sun was about 23 degrees above the horizon and the azimuth of the sun was about 283 degrees. Apparent sunset occurred at 2036.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRPORT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA records indicated that the OK35 heliport had a field elevation of 890 feet msl. There were no published radio frequencies for airport communications. The heliport had a single concrete helipad that measured 50 feet by 48 feet. There was surface mounted perimeter lighting around the helipad, a lighted windsock was located about 100 feet east of the helipad, and all lamp posts within 200 feet from the helipad had red obstruction lights.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe concrete helipad was located about 125 feet northeast from the emergency room entrance on the north side of the Choctaw Indian Hospital. About 50 feet north of the helipad was a 25 foot wide paved road which was oriented east-west. A metal lamp post about 20 feet tall was positioned on the south side of the paved road about 125 feet to the northeast from the helipad. Another lamp post about 20 feet tall was positioned about 125 feet to the northwest from the helipad. Other lamp posts on metal posts further to the west from the helipad were on the south side of the paved road and were about 40 feet tall.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was a line of trees about 40 feet tall along the north edge of the paved road. A large open flat grassy area was located on the north side of the line of trees. The closest edge of the grassy area was about 300 feet northwest from the emergency room entrance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVIDEO RECORDER&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn impact damaged Appareo Vision 1000 recorder, its separated SD memory card, wiring harness, and other components were recovered from the wreckage and examined at the NTSB Recorders Laboratory. The initial examination showed the Appareo device had sustained minor damage to the unit's P1 port and to the memory card door. Data was downloaded which showed a total of 26 files had been recorded during the period from December 19, 2012, through December 21, 2012. An additional 4 undated files, without any flight data, were recovered which were determined to be from the manufacturer's facility or from power-up events at the NTSB Recorders Laboratory.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe last recording of flight data or video and flight data was on December 20, 2012, when the helicopter was on the ground at the McAlester Regional Hospital.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident flight was not recorded on the Appareo device. At the time of the accident the operator did not have a flight data monitoring (FDM) or safety management system (SMS) program that would routinely monitor the Appareo Vision 1000 recordings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aircraft wreckage debris was located on the paved road adjacent to the hospital. The fuselage came to rest on its side, about 80 degrees to the right, and was oriented on a heading of about 330 degrees. Most wreckage debris remained within about 50 feet from the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA metal post of a 40 foot tall lamp post had been impact separated about 24 feet above the mounting flange. The damaged bottom half of the metal post was resting on the ground and remained partially attached to its mounting flange. The top portion of the separated metal post and the lamp fixture had completely separated and were located on the north side of the paved road.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe transmission and attached main rotor system was partially separated from the transmission deck but remained attached by cables and mounts. All of the transmission support arms were broken. The 'Starflex' remained in the center of the rotor hub with two of the star arms broken mid-span; one arm was separated from its thrust bearing. All three MRBs showed damage on their leading edges from about mid-span out to the tips. There were \"broom-straw\" separations, delaminating skins, and splaying signatures from the impacts. The impact scars on the MRBs. corresponded to the impact damage on the separated 40 foot tall light pole.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's seat and the medical crewmember's seats remained attached and their 4-point lap belt and shoulder harness systems remained intact. The medical stretcher base remained attached to the floor mountings, and the removable medical stretcher remained attached to the base unit. The patient restraint straps remained intact. The pilot's seat did not indicate any stroke attenuation. The upper portion of the main cabin structure was opened up by impact forces. The rear cabin bulkhead and the rear of the cabin ceiling were deformed and pushed forward. The door posts were impact separated from the roof and cabin ceiling. The windscreen and all Plexiglas windows were broken.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument panel remained mostly intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe belly structure and landing gear skids did not show significant impact damage. The tail boom was separated at the aft bulkhead, and remained partially connected by electrical wires and control cables. The separated tail boom showed impact damage, but remained intact. The tail-rotor gear box remained securely attached, and the tail-rotor and drive shaft rotated freely when the blades were moved through by hand. The left horizontal stabilizer was bent down mid-span from the impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nControl continuity was confirmed from the pilot's cyclic and collective input controls to the top of the transmission deck where the push-pull rods connect to the rotor system, and from the pilot's anti-torque pedals to the aft bulkhead to tail boom junction of the flex cable. The collective lever was found full up. The fuel flow control lever was positioned nearest to the flight gate. The emergency fuel shut off was observed in the off position; however the flex rod at the valve was broken. The fuel tank remained intact and was secure within the fuselage. Prior to wreckage recovery, about 50 gallons of fuel was removed by Hazmat personnel. The fuel was examined and no evidence of fuel contamination was noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was thermal damage near the engine exhaust where the postimpact fire had been extinguished by emergency responders; however there did not appear to be significant thermal damage to the fuselage structure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine as found was still attached to the helicopter by the front mount. The rear mount was separated during the impact sequence. All fuel, oil, and air lines were still connected and properly safety wired. The throttle and anticipator cables were still connected and pinned to the fuel control unit. The axial compressor showed signs of foreign object damage (FOD) and two of the compressor blades had the leading edge tips bent forward. The engine nose cone showed rotational scarring. The gas generator could not be rotated by hand. The free turbine blades were shed and the containment shield was bent in an oblong shape. There were small escape punctures in the exhaust pipe and a few of the liberated free turbine blades were found on the ground directly behind the exhaust pipe where the engine came to rest.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was removed from the wreckage and placed on a pallet for a partial disassembly examination. The engine Module 5 reduction gearbox was removed for inspection of the input pinion torque alignment marks. The marks were found to be misaligned approximately 2 millimeters in the tightening direction which is consistent with engine power being delivered to the drive train during the main rotor blade impact sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was performed on the passenger by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Eastern Division; Tulsa, Oklahoma.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the accident, the pilot and flight paramedic were tested for evidence of 11 drugs and alcohol in accordance with the operator's FAA approved Drug and Alcohol Testing Program. The tests were negative.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe seriously injured Flight Nurse had been transported to a hospital in another city and was not tested.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was again examined after the initial data download from the Appareo Vision 1000 device. The two-wire wiring harness was found separated at the Appareo unit connection in the ceiling of the aircraft. Initial examination at the accident scene showed the unit had remained attached to the cabin overhead, and the wiring remained attached to the aircraft near the windshield center post. At the separated end of the wiring nearest to the Appareo unit, one of the electrical wire leads was separated at the end of the wire insulation, and the other lead had remained attached to its gold colored connection pin. However, both pins were separated from the black plastic wiring plug which was not found in the wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe GPS antenna wire connection to the Appareo unit was found unplugged from the unit at the cabin overhead. The antenna wiring from the Appareo unit connection was traced down the center post and to the top of the right side instrument panel, glare shield. It was noted that the antenna RF connector was also found unplugged and laying loose near the connection. A small amount of brushing/burnishing marks was observed on the top of an instrument case neared to where the antenna connection was found lying. Little to no impact damage was noted to that part of the glare shield.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPositive electrical continuity was confirmed for the electrical circuit from the cockpit circuit breaker to the separated wire and pin at other end of the wiring harness that would attach to the Appareo Vision 1000 unit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wiring harness and circuit breaker associated with the Appareo Vision 1000 installation was removed from the wreckage and examined at the NTSB Recorders Laboratory. The wiring harness was checked for continuity and circuit breaker was tested for proper operation. The wiring harness showed continuity when checked with a multi-meter. The circuit breaker was also found to be operating normally when checked with a multi-meter and a power supply.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nORGANIZATIONAL AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEagleMed, LLC, holds an FAA air carrier certificate number 7EMA575M, and is authorized to conduct on-demand common carriage, including HEMS operations in Eurocopter AS-350-B2; AS-350-B3; and AS-355-N helicopters. They also hold authorization to conduct air ambulance operations – airplane in Beech BE-200 and BE-90 series turboprop airplanes. Their principal base of operations is in Wichita, Kansas, and they describe themselves as a leading community-based provider of air ambulance programs across the central United States. They operate 16 different community-based locations, utilizing a fleet of over 28 helicopters and turboprop airplanes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that they have begun routinely monitoring the Appareo&#x0D;\nVision 1000 system recordings as part of their SMS program. The operator also submitted a recommendation on how this accident could have been prevented and noted that the pilot \"could have used a different departure path, or followed company procedure to identify and climb above the highest obstacle before transitioning to forward flight\".&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInterviews with two other, more experienced HEMS pilots, showed that they thought that the preferred and accepted procedure for most pilots when operating from other than an established airport with clear and open arrival and departure paths was to, whenever possible, make a vertical HOGE liftoff until clear of all obstacles and then proceed forward into translational lift. They said that almost without exception this is the standard procedure for HEMS helicopter operations at an accident scene. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The air ambulance repositioning flight was en route to base following a patient transfer. Weather information forecast about 3 hours before the accident indicated a moist environment; however, visual conditions were anticipated around the time of the accident. An updated forecast was published about 10 minutes before the accident, and it indicated that fog or low stratus cloud development was possible and that visibility could decrease to near or below airport weather minimums in the early morning hours. Witness statements and the reported weather conditions indicated that patchy fog had developed near the helipad at the time of the accident and that visibility at the accident site was 1/4 mile; however, the specific visibility conditions encountered by the helicopter during its approach could not be determined. A witness reported seeing the helicopter \"flying lower than normal\" and then spinning before impact. Another witness reported seeing the helicopter in a nose-down attitude and then impact the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was located in a school parking lot, which was about 750 feet from the landing pad and at an elevation of about 900 feet mean sea level (msl). The wreckage distribution was consistent with an in-flight separation of the main rotor and tailboom. An examination of the helicopter airframe, engine, and related systems revealed no preimpact anomalies that would have precluded normal operation. Both the main rotor assembly and tailboom separated in overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of GPS data showed the accident helicopter descending in three right circuits near the landing pad just before the accident. The final recorded data were in the immediate vicinity of the accident location and indicated an altitude of 1,437 feet msl. The maneuvering flightpath of the helicopter before the accident was consistent with an attempt to avoid fog followed by a loss of control. Although the pilot was instrument rated, he had not logged recent instrument time. Further, although the pilot had recent training in night vision goggle usage and had night vision goggles available during the flight, it could not be determined if he was using them at the time of the accident. Given the reports of fog in the area and the accident circumstances, it is likely that the pilot entered instrument meteorological conditions during the approach to the helipad, which resulted in spatial disorientation and loss of control.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn June 6, 2013, about 2315 eastern daylight time, a Bell 206 L-1, N114AE, was destroyed when it impacted the ground in an elementary school parking lot while on approach to the company's helicopter landing zone near Manchester, Kentucky. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed; however, reports of patchy fog were reported by numerous eyewitnesses and a company visual flight rules flight plan was filed. The airline transport pilot and two medical personnel were fatally injured. The helicopter was owned and operated by Air Evac EMS Inc. and was operated under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a repositioning flight to the company-owned helipad. The flight originated from the St. Joseph-London Heliport (5KY9), London, Kentucky about 2259.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNumerous eye and auditory witness statements were recorded by the Kentucky State Police and reported to the NTSB for reference. Several eyewitnesses reported to the State Police that the helicopter was observed \"flying lower than normal\" and \"spinning\" prior to impact. Some of the eyewitnesses reported that there was no fog in the area and the sky was clear at the time of the accident. Other eyewitnesses reported that while driving down the road that ran in front of, and parallel to, the elementary school, and located between the accident site and the intended landing location, they observed the helicopter in a nose down attitude, impact the ground, and subsequently engulfed in a fireball; however, they also stated the visibility at the time was around 1/4 mile. The eye and auditory witnesses that reported the clear skies were at their residence about 1/2 mile from the accident site on the opposite side of the creek that ran along the back side of the school. One of the eyewitnesses observed the helicopter in a tail low attitude, then in a more level attitude prior to the engine noise ceasing, which took place prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and company records, the pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with a rating for airplane multiengine land and a held a type rating in CE-500 airplanes, a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, helicopter, and instrument helicopter, and a control tower operator certificate with limitations for Simmons Army Airfield, NC GCA only. He also had a flight instructor certificate for airplane single-engine, multiengine, and instrument airplane. He held a second-class medical certificate, which was issued on January 4, 2013, and had one restriction of \"must have available glasses for near vision.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to company records, the pilot was hired on February 16, 2013. At that time the pilot reported that he had 4,877 total hours of flight experience and 1,902 flight hours in helicopters, of which, 1,600 total flight hours were in Bell 206/OH 58 Helicopters. Since the start of his employment, the company had recorded 54.4 total flight hours for the pilot, not including the flights on the day of the accident. The pilot had completed ground training on February 16, 2013, and flight training on March 3, 2013, in the handling and use of the ITT Model F4949 night vision goggles. The operator reported that the pilot had no previous recorded night vision goggle flight time, and that since employment, he had logged 13.2 total hours of night vision goggle experience. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to records provided by the operator, in the 3 days preceding that accident, the pilot had worked 3 shifts with a total of 36.6 hours of duty and 2.5 hours of total flight time. According to the company records, during that period of time the pilot had 53.2 total hours of \"Hours Off\" time. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA and company records, the helicopter was issued an airworthiness certificate on September 26, 1980 and was registered to Air Evac EMS, Inc on October 31, 2002. It was equipped with an Allison 250-C30P engine, with 650 shaft horsepower. The helicopter was modified with enhanced power and increased payload, which gave it a further designation of an \"L-1 Plus.\" The helicopter was on an Approved Airworthiness Inspection Program (AAIP) and its most recent event 1 inspection was completed on June 6, 2013. The helicopter was equipped with a SkyTrac system, which recorded data in 5 second intervals and some of the data was transmitted to the operator's enhanced operation control center (OCC) once every minute. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCOMMUNICATIONS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCommunication recordings obtained from the operator, indicated that at 2312:24, the pilot announced that \"one oh nine roger show us arriving at the base\" followed by the Operators Central Communication (CENCOM) responding at 2312:30, with \"air evac one oh nine got you on final for base.\" At 2315:02, a recording of a male voice was captured and stated \"no.\" No other recordings were captured for the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 2339 recorded weather observation at London-Corbin Airport-Magee Field (LOZ), London, Kentucky, included calm wind, 2 1/2 miles visibility due to mist, scattered clouds at 8,000 feet above ground level (agl), temperature 19 degrees C, dew point 19 degrees C, and a barometric altimeter of 29.80 inches of mercury&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 2253 record weather at LOZ included calm wind, 6 miles visibility due to mist, scattered clouds at 5,500 feet agl, temperature 20 degrees C, dew point 19 degrees C and a barometric altimeter of 29.81 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NWS Surface Analysis Chart for 2300 EDT depicted a low-pressure center very near the accident location, with a cold front extending southwest, and a warm front extending east from the low-pressure center. A separate cold front was advancing from the north through the northern portion of Kentucky. Surface temperatures in eastern Kentucky and eastern Tennessee were generally in the high 60's° F. Dew point temperatures were in the mid- to high 60's°F. Station models depicted the wind as calm or light, with one station near the accident site reporting mist.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA NWS Weather Depiction Chart for 0000 EDT on June 7, 2013, depicted fronts in a similar fashion to the Surface Analysis Chart. In addition, the Weather Depiction Chart, which provides contours for areas of IFR and MVFR conditions, indicated the accident location was in an area of VFR conditions with ceilings greater than 3,000 feet agl and a visibility greater than 5 miles.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn Area Forecast Discussion (AFD) was issued at 2053 EDT by the NWS Weather Forecast Office in Jackson, Kentucky (KJKL). The aviation portion of the AFD, which was originally issued at 2005 EDT in a previous AFD, was:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFXUS63 KJKL 070253 AAB AFDJKL&#x0D;\nAREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE JACKSON KY&#x0D;\n1053 PM EDT THU JUN 6 2013&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n.AVIATION...(FOR THE 00Z TAFS THROUGH 00Z FRIDAY EVENING) ISSUED AT 805 PM EDT THU JUN 6 2013&#x0D;\nISOLATED CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE UNTIL AN HOUR OR TWO PAST&#x0D;\nSUNSET AT THE TAF SITES AND WELL INTO THE NIGHT OVER THE FAR SOUTHEAST.

The helipad was 40 feet by 40 feet and was located approximately 750 feet northwest of the accident site. The helipad was 895 feet above mean sea level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted an elementary school parking lot on its right side and in a partially inverted attitude. According to surveillance video, the helicopter exploded on impact and a fireball ensued. The accident flight path was oriented on a 268 degree heading. The debris path began approximately 300 feet prior to the main wreckage and terminated approximately 90 feet past. The main rotor blades and upper deck of the helicopter came to rest approximately 300 feet prior and to the east of the impact site. The tailboom aft of the aft bulkhead and tailrotor with the gear box still attached came to rest about 300 feet to the northeast of the impact location. Both items came to rest in a tree line that ran perpendicular to the flight path and the main rotor and upper deck assembly came to rest immediately below a 3 phase power line. According to local authorities, the power line was not severed; however, a cross member located on a pole near the accident site had given way resulting in a power outage in the area. A tree, approximately 80 feet in height, located near the main rotor blade, exhibited limb damage towards the top, which was consistent with damage produced by rotor blades although due to the height it could not be confirmed. A fluid splatter, similar in appearance as an oil splatter, was located from about 100 feet prior to the wreckage up to the wreckage and was about 30 feet in width. The left side patient/crew door was located along the debris path and to the north of the path. The inside of the door exhibited hydraulic oil splatter through the entire interior.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCockpit/Cabin Section&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit/cabin section was thermally damaged and according to local authorities came to rest inverted. The engine was co-located with the cabin section. The left side instrument panel remained intact and exhibited thermal damage. The pilot's instrument panel and overhead panel were thermally damaged and did not yield any pertinent information. Examination of the pilot seat revealed extensive thermal damage; however, the seat belt mechanism was located, and was latched with the shoulder harness also secured to the latching mechanism. The anti-torque pedals were impact separated and one pedal exhibited overstress factures. Due to the extensive thermal and impact damage neither the cyclic nor collective remained attached. However, control continuity was confirmed from the aft bulkhead to the tail rotor through the tailboom fracture points. Examination of the remaining seatbelts indicated that two sets of shoulder harness latches associated with the flight nurse and paramedic seats were unsecured, The patient transport stretcher was located in the vicinity of the cockpit; however, exhibited extensive thermal damage. The seat belt latches associated with the stretcher appeared to be latched. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing skid assembly was located about 35 feet forward and to the left of the main wreckage as viewed from the debris path and was separated from the fuselage of the helicopter. The rear attach area exhibited some thermal damage but no other thermal damage was noted on the landing skid assembly. The right side of the skid gear, as viewed from the tail of the helicopter, had crush damage on the aft portion of the gear and was impact separated at the aft cross tube. The forward portion of the skid exhibited crush damage on the side wall of the skid tube, as well as numerous scraping and gouge marks along the tube. The right hand step was also impact separated at the forward attach point. The left hand tube and step exhibited slight inward bowing about midspan of the tube; it remained attached to the gear assembly. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom fractured just aft of the intercostal support and forward of the horizontal stabilizer. The forward portion of the tailboom skin exhibited fracture marks consistent with compressive forces. The right side of the fuselage exhibited impact and crush damage consistent with a right side low at impact. The main and tail rotor flight controls exhibited impact and thermal damage. The fractures and position of the wreckage were consistent with an inflight breakup prior to ground impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was co-located with the main wreckage and was found inverted. The engine remained attached through one engine mount and several steel braided hoses, the other engine mounts exhibited impact and thermal damage and were impact fractured. The compressor impeller blades rotated by hand with some resistance noted; however, several blades exhibited extensive damage to the blade tips. The upper and lower chip detectors were removed, examined, and did not display any debris. The engine was removed from the helicopter and shipped to the engine manufacturer for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain Rotor Assembly and Transmission&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor assembly and transmission (upperdeck) was located to the south side of the debris path about 300 feet prior to the main wreckage. The upperdeck came to rest at the edge of a ditch immediately below 3-phase power lines. The power lines exhibited marks similar to impact marks created by a falling object from above. The blades exhibited a braided pattern along the bottom side similar to the braided wire pattern of the 3-phase wires. Approximately 3 feet of the tip of one blade was impact separated. The fracture marks exhibited overstress signatures consistent with an overstress fracture. The mast exhibited a slight S-bend along the length. The transmission was rotated utilizing the connecting rod and continuity was confirmed through the main rotor system. The K-Flex main drive shaft was located in the parking lot approximately 75 feet from the main wreckage and exhibited rotation scoring on the engine end outer diameter consistent with contact during rotation with the forward engine firewall. No evidence was located along the leading edge of the blades that would be consistent with striking a stationary object; however, 65 inches from the center of the mast and 11.5 inches in length was faint paint transfer marks consistent with the paint color of the helicopter. Examination of the right side engine cowling exhibited a main rotor blade impact mark. Both chip detectors were removed, examined, and noted as unremarkable. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTail Section&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor assembly remained attached to the tailboom. The tail rotor blades exhibited minimal leading edge damage and the vertical tail assembly had been impact separated from the tail boom; however, the vertical tail assembly was located in a tree in the immediate vicinity of the tail boom. Continuity was confirmed from the fracture point to the rotor blades as well as to the horizontal stabilizer. The tail rotor drive assembly shroud was removed and the assembly was examined. The drive assembly hangers aft of the fracture point exhibited aft movement and rotational scoring on the hanger assembly. The assembly hangers forward of the fracture point exhibited forward movement and rotational scoring on the hanger assembly. The tail rotor driveshaft remained connected to the end of the freewheeling unit and the splined shaft coupling was disconnected from the oil cooler. The driveshaft exhibited a fracture adjacent to the tailboom fracture. The chip detector was removed and examined and was unremarkable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe report for the postaccident airframe examination is included in the public docket for this accident investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nORGANIZATIONAL AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA issued Air Evac EMS, Inc., an operating certificate in February of 1986 to conduct on demand emergency medical service transports. At the time of the accident, Air Evac conducted air ambulance operations in 15 states with 114 bases. The accident crew was based at Manchester, Kentucky. The corporate headquarters, including training, the Director of Operations, Chief Pilot, and Director of Safety were located in O'Fallon, Missouri. The FAA Flight Standards District Office in St. Louis, Missouri managed the operating certificate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe company operated 2 different make and models of helicopters, and employed about 450 pilots. Prior to employment, each pilot was required to have a minimum of 2,000 hours total time; 500 hours turbine time, 100 hours of night flying, and an instrument rating.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEST AND RESARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was disassembled and examined at the Rolls-Royce facility at Indianapolis, Indiana on July 9, 2013. During the engine examination nothing was discovered that would prevent normal engine operation. Rotation scoring signatures were noted throughout the different blade sections and were consistent with engine operation at impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine examination report is included in the public docket for this accident investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of Bird Remains&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral samples of potential bird matter were taken from an area around the pitch change links, located on the main rotor assembly and sent to the Smithsonian Institution's Feather Identification Laboratory in Washington, D.C. The samples were microscopically examined by personnel at the laboratory for evidence of feather remains, no remains were found. DNA testing was conducted and two of samples contained DNA. One sample contained a 94 percent match to the order of birds that includes perching birds. The other sample contained a 99.6 percent match to an Empidonax minimus also known as a Least Flycatcher. For the Laboratory to consider the sample test reliable a 98 percent or better is required. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPre Flight Risk Assessment&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAir Evac pilots were required to use a Risk Assessment Worksheet prior to all air medical and air&#x0D;\nmedical reposition flights. There were two versions of the worksheet, the short form, and the long form.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe short form had 17 areas of review. Each area was assigned a numerical point, or points, by the pilot. The area's point(s) were added into a final tally of points, which was considered the flight's risk assessment. The short form areas included pilot experience with the company, pilot experience in the make and model of the helicopter, and weather and terrain for the flight. The 10 areas under weather and terrain were further broken down into a point assignment for day operations and a higher point assignment for night operations. If the total point value of the short form was less than 35 points, pilots were advised that the flight is at their \"discretion.\" If the total of the short form was 35 points or greater, the pilot was required to complete the long form and consult with the operational control center.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe long form had 31 areas to be reviewed and scored the same way as the short form. A score of 35 points or less was low risk with the conduct of the flight being pilot's choice. A score of 35 points to 60 points was low to moderate risk, advising the pilot to exercise caution. A score of 61 points to 99 points was moderate to high risk, advising the pilot to exercise extreme caution. A score of 100 points and above was high risk, and the flight was not permitted. Use of the long form and consultation with the operational control center was required for all risk levels above 34 points.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe risk score for the accident flight was 30 points, as reported by the pilot prior to the flight, which did not require the use of the long form, and did not require a consultation with the operational control center.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOperations Specifications&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator's weather minimums, criteria for flying at night in mountainous conditions varied depending on if the helicopter was equipped with Night Vision Imaging System (NVIA) or Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS). Furthermore, weather minimum criteria were based on if the flight was a \"local\" or \"cross country\" flight. The General Operations Manual Section 5.20, defined the \"local flying area\" during daylight hours as 25 nautical miles (NM) from the base and the \"night local area\" was 5 NM from the base, all other flights were considered \"cross country.\" Since the accident helicopter was equipped with the proper equipment, as specified in the General Operations Manual, and the flight was considered \"cross country,\" the weather minimums for the accident flight were 1000 foot ceilings and the visibility minimum was 5 statute miles. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAir Evac Pilot Training&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, Air Evac conducted ground and simulator-based training with their pilots. The pilots received ground training on an annual basis, which included situational awareness, human factors, patient interaction and awareness, critical incident task saturation, workload management, risk assessment, loss of tail rotor effectiveness, weather, and weather preparedness for the day to enhance launch decision making. Additional training included all required aspects of Parts 91 and 135 as well as night operations, the FAA approved night vision goggle (NVG) curriculum, and recovery from inadvertent instrument meteorological conditions (IIMC) conditions. The pilots received simulator training every six months. The simulator training included unusual attitudes and recovery from IIMC, a PAR/ASR approach, a GPS approach, simulated white out and brown out conditions, and several emergency procedures. The emergency procedures included engine failures, hydraulic failures, and component failures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilots also received NVG flight and ground training. Flight training was conducted at night flying various maneuvers, experienced different emergency procedures, system failures, and flight into various lighting conditions. In addition, IMC conditions were simulated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOperational Control Center&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAir Evac operated one main Operational Control Center (OCC) located in O'Fallon, Missouri. The OCC was manned by multiple dispatchers performing the functions of call taking and&#x0D;\nflight following. These dispatchers were not FAA certificated aircraft dispatchers; however, they were trained in emergency response. Each dispatcher worked a 12-hour shift and EMS operations at Air Evac were conducted 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In addition to flight followers, the OCC was staffed 24/7 with \"Operational Controllers.\" Air Evac Operations Specifications - A008 OPERATIONAL CONTROL lists Tier 1 Operational Control: \"The&#x0D;\nOperational Control Center (OCC), through the authority of the Director of Operations, and through the Chief Pilot, exercises Operational Control of company aircraft. The OCC has the authority to decline a flight request, or terminate a flight, in the interest of safety.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Operational Controllers did not perform the duties of Flight Followers, rather their purpose was to serve as a resource, available by radio, to assist the pilot with weather, publications, and&#x0D;\nemergency information, if requested.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEach dispatch and operation controller station was equipped with a computer, several monitors, a&#x0D;\ntelephone, and a radio. Each computer was equipped with software to provide updated weather&#x0D;\ninformation, satellite tracking of all active operations, flight details, and flight timers. Each conversation was recorded.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll calls for dispatch were made to the OCC. The dispatcher would determine which aircraft was best positioned for the mission, track base status, and would notify the crew by either a page, radio call, or telephone call. Base status was determined at crew change and as the shift progressed, with changes in weather/crews.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSkyTrac&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSkyTrac provided satellite-tracking capabilities and could provide GPS coordinates, ground speed, a pictorial depiction of aircraft location, and text communications between the aircraft and dispatch. Immediately after the aircraft's power was applied the system tracking became active. SkyTrac recorded the aircraft latitude and longitude position every 5 seconds and every 60 seconds it would send the OCC a position update. Once the flight had landed uneventfully, the dispatcher closed out the flight record. Review of global positioning system data depicted the accident helicopter descending in three right circuits in the vicinity of the landing pad, just prior to the accident. The final recorded data was at 2314:44 and indicated an altitude of 1437 feet above mean sea level on a heading of 315 degrees and an groundspeed of 6 knots in the immediate vicinity of the accident location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNight Vision Goggles&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operations specifications, the helicopter was equipped with two ITT model F4949 NVGs. One goggle was designated for the pilot and the other was for either the flight medic or flight nurse to be worn, when the pilot was landing utilizing NVG's. These goggles are equipped with a rear-mounted, low-profile battery pack, which utilizes four AA alkaline batteries. The power was provided by a cable extending from the battery pack, over the helmet, and into a connector in the mount. The NVG consisted of two components, the mount assembly and the binocular assembly. The mount assembly was designed to be secured to the helmet and hold the binocular assembly in position. The binocular assembly consisted of a pair of monocular assemblies which incorporate the optical elements as well as numerous adjustment controls. The goggles included flip-up/flip-down capability.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUnited States Army Field Manual (FM) 3-04.203, Fundamental of Flight, May 2007&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe United States Army has incorporated NVGs into their flying programs, several decades prior to the accident. While not required reading for civilian pilots, FM 3-04.203 was developed to educate pilots on the principles surrounding aviation and to better prepare the pilot to react to unexpected conditions. In Chapter 4, \"Rotary-Wing Night Flight,\" several passages describe the hazards and risks of night flight with night vision systems. Section 4-89 \"Weather\" states in part \"When using NVGs, aviators may fail to detect entry into or presence of IMC. NVGs enable crewmembers to see through obscurations, such as fog, rain, haze, dust and smoke, depending on density. As density increases, aircrews can detect a gradual reduction in visual acuity as less light is available. Certain visual cues are evident when restriction to visibility occurs. The apparent increase in size and density of halos during bad weather is an illusion. The halos are due to the electron spread for bright light sources, size remains the same. Any reduction in visibility decreases light intensity and reduces density of the halo. While contrast decreases, video noise may increase. There may be a loss of celestial lights, while the moon and stars may fade or disappear due to overcast conditions. When these conditions are present severity of the condition is evaluated and appropriate action taken. Actions include reducing airspeed, increasing altitude, reversing course, aborting the mission, or landing. If visual flight cannot be maintained the crew must execute appropriate IMC recovery procedures.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSpatial Disorientation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3), \"Night flying is very different from day flying and demands more attention of the pilot. The most noticeable difference is the limited availability of outside visual references. Therefore, flight instruments should be used to a greater degree.… Generally, at night it is difficult to see clouds and restrictions to visibility, particularly on dark nights or under overcast. The pilot flying under VFR must exercise caution to avoid flying into clouds or a layer of fog.\" The handbook described some hazards associated with flying in airplanes under VFR when visual references, such as the ground or horizon, are obscured. \"The vestibular sense (motion sensing by the inner ear) in particular tends to confuse the pilot. Because of inertia, the sensory areas of the inner ear cannot detect slight changes in the attitude of the airplane, nor can they accurately sense attitude changes that occur at a uniform rate over a period of time. On the other hand, false sensations are often generated; leading the pilot to believe the attitude of the airplane has changed when in fact, it has not. These false sensations result in the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Instrument Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-15), a rapid acceleration \"...stimulates the otolith organs in the same way as tilting the head backwards. This action creates the somatogravic illusion of being in a nose-up attitude, especially in situations without good visual references. The disoriented pilot may push the aircraft into a nose-low&#x0D;\nor dive attitude.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA publication Medical Facts for Pilots (AM-400-03/1), described several vestibular illusions associated with the operation of aircraft in low visibility conditions. Somatogyral illusions, those involving the semicircular canals of the vestibular system, were generally placed into one of four categories, one of which was the \"graveyard spiral.\" According to the text, the graveyard spiral, \"…is associated with a return to level flight following an intentional or unintentional prolonged bank turn. For example, a pilot who enters a banking turn to the left will initially have a sensation of a turn in the same direction. If the left turn continues (~20 seconds or more), the pilot will experience the sensation that the airplane is no longer turning to the left. At this point, if the pilot attempts to level the wings this action will produce a sensation that the airplane is turning and banking in the opposite direction (to the right). If the pilot believes the illusion of a right turn (which can be very compelling), he/she will reenter the original left turn in an attempt to counteract the sensation of a right turn. Unfortunately, while this is happening, the airplane is still turning to the left and losing latitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPulling the control yoke/stick and applying power while turning would not be a good idea–because it would only make the left turn tighter. If the pilot fails to recognize the illusion and does not level the wings, the airplane will continue turning left and losing altitude until it impacts the ground.\" -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter pilot was conducting an aerial tour. After the helicopter did not return when it was expected, a search was conducted. The wreckage was located the following day in a sparsely populated and densely wooded area. Signs of impact damage were found on nearby trees. A postimpact fire had consumed the fuselage and most of the empennage. A postaccident examination of the airframe revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. A power line was found wrapped around the main rotor drive shaft, and a section of the power line was found resting on the ground leading from the power line pole toward the main wreckage. Before impact, the power line was perpendicular to the helicopter flightpath and suspended about 65 feet above the ground. It is likely that the pilot did not see and avoid the power line and that the helicopter impacted the power line and, subsequently, trees and terrain.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The four-seat, single main rotor, single-engine helicopter, serial number 11349, was constructed primarily of metal, and manufactured in 2006. The helicopter was powered by a 260-horsepower Lycoming IO-540-AE1A5 engine, serial number L-31379-48A, and with a maximum continuous rating of 245-horsepower.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was maintained on an annual inspection plan as well as a 100-hour inspection plan. A review of the helicopter's maintenance logbooks revealed that a 100-hour inspection was completed on the airframe and engine on March 13, 2013, at a total time of 1,219.6 hours. - On May 24, 2013, about 1800 central daylight time, a Robinson R44 II helicopter, N569BC, collided with a powerline near Cross Timbers, Missouri. The commercial pilot and passenger were fatally injured and the helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Lucas Oil Products, Inc. under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a corporate flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight and no flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Lucas Oil Speedway, Wheatland, Missouri, about 1730.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to information provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the pilot's landing zone marshal, the helicopter took off from the speedway to provide an aerial tour for the passenger and did not return when it was expected. A local search was conducted about 2100 to locate the helicopter. The wreckage was discovered from the air about 0130 on the following day in a densely wooded area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a witness near the accident scene, he observed the helicopter flying overhead and then appeared to land in a field nearby. He stated that as the helicopter was flying overhead, the engine did not sounds normal. However, he is not familiar with helicopter engines and their sounds. Moments later, the helicopter appeared to have lifted off from the ground and then level off. He did not notice anything out of the ordinary at that time. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot on May 28, 2013, by Southwest Missouri Forensics, Springfield, Missouri. The autopsy reported the cause of death as cerebral anoxia secondary to hypoxemia due to aspiration of blood induced by blunt force trauma to the head and chest.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute prepared a Final Forensic Toxicology Fatal Accident Report. The results were negative for all screened substances. - The automated weather report from Camdenton Memorial Airport (KH21), which was about 30 miles east of the accident site, reported at 1755: wind 110 degrees at 7 knots, 10 miles visibility, clear skies, temperature 72 degrees Fahrenheit (F), dewpoint 41 degrees F, and a barometric pressure of 30.24 inches of Mercury. - The pilot, age 32, held a commercial pilot certificate for airplane single engine land, airplane multi engine land, rotorcraft helicopter, and airplane instrument. He also held a flight instructor certificate for helicopter and flight instructor for instrument helicopter. He was issued a second class medical certificate issued on June 5, 2012.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the pilot's logbooks revealed that as of May 19, 2013, he accumulated 1,983.5 total flight hours. Of the 1,983.5 hours, 1,054.5 hours were in the make and model of the accident helicopter, 1,041.4 of which he served as pilot in command. He accumulated 918.8 flight hours in the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's ground marshal, when asked about the pilot's flying habits, he reported the pilot liked to be at least 500 feet above any clouds and no lower than 300 feet above ground level when the clouds were not a factor. The pilot would fly at cruise speeds so the passengers could take pictures. - A postaccident on-scene examination of the helicopter was conducted on May 26, 2013, by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Investigator-in-Charge (IIC), inspectors from the FAA, and a technical representative from the airframe manufacturer. The helicopter came to rest in a sparsely populated and densely wooded area of rolling terrain about 7 miles northeast of the Lucas Oil Speedway. A postimpact fire consumed the fuselage and most of the tail boom. The main rotor, tail rotor, and tail rotor gear box separated from the helicopter during the accident sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest in an upright position on a northerly heading. There were signs of impact damage on the nearby trees and the rotor blades, windscreen, and metal fragments were scattered across the wreckage path. The main wreckage and surrounding area received thermal damage. The forward cabin was positioned where the second tree was located; it was mostly consumed by fire and impact damage was evident. The aft cabin area was positioned just behind the tree and was mostly consumed by fire. The area from the vertical firewall to halfway through the tail boom was also consumed by fire. The second half of the tail boom, which contained the registration number decal, received impact and thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA powerline, which exhibited impact damage, was found wrapped around the main rotor and a section of the powerline was found on the ground leading from the powerline pole to the main wreckage. The origin of the powerline was traced back to a powerline pole which would have suspended the line about 65 feet above the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity could not be established due to impact and thermal damage, but flight control fractures were consistent with overload and thermal damage. All of the associated hardware and rod ends remained attached respectively. All flight control connections were accounted for and secure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotational scoring was evident between the fixed and rotating swash plate. The main rotor blades were fractured in multiple places and were labeled A and B for identification purposes only. The spar of blade A was separated about 18\" from the hub assembly. The spar from blade B was separated about 24\" from the hub assembly. Beyond the initial points of separation, the remaining portion of each spar was intact and sustained impact damage. The leading edges of the blades exhibited chord-wise striations in a chatter pattern that was consistent with contacting the metal powerline.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor blades were both separated at the root fittings and received impact damage. The tail rotor blades were labeled A and B for identification purposes only. Blade A was fractured the root fitting and blade B was fractured in multiple places. Both blades exhibited leading edge impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was no evidence of abnormal wear or damage on either the upper or lower sheave grooves. The upper sheave exhibited rotational scoring around the entire aft face. The sprag clutch assembly in the upper sheave still operated as designed. Continuity was confirmed from the clutch shaft to the forward flex coupling assembly which was still connected to the main rotor transmission input. The main rotor gear box was fractured in overload just above the case connecting point. The mast and the upper half of the case came to rest beside the main wreckage. The remaining main rotor transmission case was melted. Continuity was confirmed from the main rotor ring gear to the main rotor drive shaft. The hub assembly remained attached and continuity was confirmed at the connection point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe entire instrument panel was detached from the cockpit and was found near the main wreckage. The panel sustained impact damage. The ignition switch was found in the left magneto position. The flight instruments provided no useful information. The filaments for each warning light were examined and none of them exhibited stretching that would have indicated they were illuminated at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine received impact and thermal damage. The bottom of the case melted and the crankshaft was clearly visible. The accessories were melted away from the case. Cylinders 1-3-5 were separated from the case. Cylinders 2-4-6 remained attached to the case.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was retro-fitted with main and auxiliary bladder fuel tanks. Fuel quantity stickers specific to the bladder tanks were placed on the instrument panel. The bladder tanks received thermal damage and only the caps were recovered. Bladder material was evident around the aluminum fitting on the underside of the tank. The smell of aviation gas was evident underneath the area where the tanks were located. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was maneuvering at low altitude during cattle herding operations. The helicopter collided with power lines and subsequently impacted terrain. Power lines were found wrapped around the main rotor mast about 25 times. Postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA small amount of acute blood was found in the left ventricle of the pilot's brain, but no significant traumatic injuries were found; thus, it is likely the hemorrhage occurred during an acute premortem event. Given the autopsy findings and that the pilot knew the flying area well and would have likely known where the power lines were located, it is likely that he was impaired or incapacitated by an acute neurologic event in the seconds before impact with the power lines.",
    "FactualNarrative": "During an in person interview with the pilot's son, he recalled that his father complained of chest pain the week prior to the accident. He further stated that his father completed a computed axial tomography (CAT scan) on April 25, 2013. The result of the CAT scan revealed no abnormalities. - The five-seat, 2-bladed, Bell 206B helicopter, serial number (S/N) 2216, was manufactured in 1977, and was powered by an Allison 250-C20B engine, rated at 420 shaft horsepower. The helicopter was maintained under a manufacturer's approved inspection program. Its most recent required maintenance inspection was completed on August 8, 2012. At that time, the airframe and engine had accrued 10,417 total hours of operation. - On April 27, 2013, about 0830 mountain daylight time, a Bell 206B helicopter, N150SP, impacted power lines and terrain while maneuvering north of Shepherd, Montana. The helicopter was registered to Tongue Canyon Aviation, LLC, Worden, Montana, and operated by the pilot under provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The private pilot, the sole occupant of the helicopter, was fatally injured. The helicopter received substantial damage to the fuselage and rotor system. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The local flight originated from the helicopter's home base in Worden, Montana at about 0730 to help with the herding of cattle on a field north of Shepherd.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who was a ranch hand, stated that the helicopter was maneuvering about 100-200 feet above the ground. The witness reported that the helicopter was north bound and flying in the direction of high tension power transmission lines. Shortly after losing sight of the helicopter, he heard two \"whoosh\" sounds, and about 5 seconds later, he heard a \"boom\" sound. He then saw black smoke in the direction of the sounds.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to local law enforcement personnel, the helicopter impacted two single phase overhead power lines near the accident site. - The NTSB's chief medical officer reviewed the pilot's autopsy, toxicology report, the FAA blue ribbon medical file, and the NTSB IIC's reports.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the medical officer's review of the pilot's medical records on file with the FAA's airman branch, it was revealed that the pilot suffered a blood clot (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) in 1994 and began anticoagulation therapy with Warfarin (a blood thinner). In 1997 he had thyroid surgery and in 2008 he reported paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and hypothyroidism to the FAA. Over the years, he reported multiple orthopedic surgeries and in 2008 reported cataract surgery and carotid artery surgery. After providing supplemental information, the pilot routinely received special issuance, time-limited medical certificates. He was medically certified at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForensic Medicine and Pathology, PLLC, in Billings Montana, conducted an autopsy on the pilot on May 1, 2013. The autopsy report revealed no significant traumatic injuries and determined that smoke inhalation was the cause of death, secondary to fire following a helicopter accident. Other significant conditions identified included hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. During the examination of the head, 3cc of acute hemorrhage was found in the left lateral ventricle. In conclusion, the medical examiner reported, \"the small area of hemorrhage in to the ventricles is in an area not usually associated with trauma, but rather could be associated with hypertensive cardiovascular disease, which may also have been a factor contributing to his death and even the crash.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology tests on the pilot. According to CAMI's report, 16 percent of carbon monoxide was detected in the blood, and Warfarin was detected in the blood and Urine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA copy of the NTSB chief medical officer's factual report is included in the public docket for this accident. - A review of recorded data from the Billings International Airport, Billings, Montana, automated weather observation station, about 24 nautical miles southwest of the accident site, revealed that at 0653 conditions were; wind 230 degrees at 11 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, few clouds at 12,000 feet, temperature 13° Celsius, dew point minus 2° Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.07 inches of Mercury. Using the reported weather conditions and field elevation, the calculated density altitude was about 3,805 feet. - The pilot, age 81, held a private pilot certificate with an airplane single-engine land, multi-engine land, and instrument airplane rating. He also held a private pilot certificate for rotorcraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had been involved in a prior accident on March 5, 2007, (NTSB ID No. SEA07CA069), in which he failed to maintain clearance from a piece of farm equipment that had been parked near his landing location. The probable cause of that accident was \"The pilot's failure to maintain clearance between the tail rotor of his helicopter and a piece of farm equipment during the landing sequence.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA third-class airman medical certificate was issued on June 23, 2011, with limitations that he must wear corrective lenses for near and distant vision. The pilot reported on his most recent medical certificate application that he had accumulated about 7,500 total flight hours and 50 hours in the last six months. - Examination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter impacted a low level power line and terrain about 10 statute miles north-northeast of Shepherd, Montana. The wreckage debris was contained within an area of about 70 feet in diameter and was mostly consumed by post-impact fire. The two power lines that were severed by the helicopter had been repaired prior to the examination, and ran directly above the main wreckage. The two supporting power poles were not damaged. The left rear entry door was found near the main wreckage and had thermal damage on its lower exterior surface. A main rotor blade tip section and one tail rotor blade section was found about 100 feet from the main wreckage. The fuselage came to rest on a heading of about 217-degrees and the tail boom was oriented on a heading of about 312-degrees magnetic. All major structural components of the helicopter were located throughout the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was found in the upright position with impact damage to the left induction tube and crush damage to the exhaust pipes and freewheeling unit cover assembly. The induction inlet had impact damage to the trailing edge of all stator blades and the first stage of compressor blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor transmission was lying on its side with the intact main rotor mast pointing aft and downhill, and exhibited thermal damage. The transmission was located forward of the engine in the wreckage debris. Power cable was wrapped around the mast about 25 times. The swashplate assembly was manipulated by hand and appeared to be functionally operational.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blades remained attached to the mast and were able to be manipulated by hand in the pitch axis. Both main rotor blade grips were fractured and the fractures were consistent with mechanical overload. The rotor blade laying downhill, was mostly deformed by a post-impact fire and had remnants of power line cable lying next to its mid-section. A 2-foot section of the blade tip had separated and was found about 100 feet from the main wreckage. The rotor blade lying uphill, exhibited significant impact damage about one-third of the way outboard of the blade root. The blade's afterbody was not evident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom assembly was lying on its right side and was grossly deformed due to extreme thermal damage. The outline of the tailboom, horizontal stabilizer, and vertical fin assembly were clearly visible in the ash. The segmented tail rotor driveshaft was thermally damaged and not clearly defined; however, the Thomas couplings and related adapters were observed in their relative positions in the tailboom debris. The tail rotor gearbox and tail rotor blade assembly was located in its appropriate position in the tailboom debris. The tail rotor gearbox exhibited thermal damage, and was unable to be rotated by hand. One tail rotor blade was fractured near the tail rotor blade grip and the remainder of that blade was located within inches of the tail rotor assembly. The other tail rotor blade was fractured in a similar location; however, the remainder of that blade was located about 100 feet from the tailboom assembly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe high-skid landing gear was fractured in multiple locations. The right-hand skid tube was fractured on both sides of the forward cross tube attach point and forward of the aft cross tube attach point. The forward cross tube was fractured outboard of the fuselage attach point. The left-hand skid tube was fractured forward of the aft cross tube attach point. The aft end of both skids remained attached to the aft cross tube; the aft end of the right-hand skid tube was bent upward about 45 degrees. Both skid tubes forward of the forward cross tube attach points were unremarkable. The remaining part of each skid tube exhibited thermal damage. The right-hand skid, right-hand step, and forward cross tube were located inverted with the skid toe and forward end of the step pointing upward at about a 45 degree angle. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot, who also owned the helicopter company, hired a mechanic to change the main rotor blades on the helicopter. The main rotor blade change also required several adjustments to the pitch change rods on the rotor system followed by test flights. The accident flight was the second maintenance flight of the day and occurred about 1 hour of operation after the main rotor blade replacement.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses observed the helicopter flying and heard a loud \"pop\" sound followed by components separating from the helicopter. They then observed the tail section separate from the helicopter and the helicopter crash to the ground. Witness statements and wreckage documentation were consistent with a main rotor blade rotating upward during the accident flight, which was followed by a tail strike and the helicopter rolling inverted. Subsequently, the mast bumped and the helicopter descended uncontrolled to the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who had flown the helicopter numerous times, stated that he observed the mechanic make adjustments to the pitch change rods on the rotor system during the maintenance procedure. He also stated that the mechanic told him that the owner of the helicopter was upset and that the helicopter manufacturer installed refurbished spindles onto the new blades. The owner's frustration likely distracted the mechanic and/or applied pressure for the mechanic to return the helicopter to service and revenue operations as soon as possible. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn-scene examination of the wreckage revealed that the pitch-link-to-swash-plate connection for one of the main rotor blades was missing. The pitch link and horn were found about 90 feet away. Metallurgical examination of the main rotor system revealed that the attaching hardware for the pitch-link-to-swash-plate connection was most likely not secured properly and separated after about 1 hour of flight following the maintenance. All other failures were consistent with overstress and no preexisting cracking was noted. No other anomalies with the helicopter structure, systems, or engine were found.",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to a pilot-rated witness, who was at the hangar during the maintenance procedure, the pilot was upset during the course of the day. The pilot had conducted conversations with the helicopter manufacturer over the installation of the refurbished spindles that were installed on the new blades and that it was costing him $10,000 a month in lost revenues due to the helicopter not being in service. The pilot witness, who had flown the helicopter numerous times, stated that he observed the mechanic make adjustments to the pitch change rods on the rotor system during the maintenance procedure. He also stated that the mechanic told him that the owner of the helicopter was upset that the helicopter manufacturer installed refurbished spindles onto the new blades. - The four-seat, skid-type landing gear helicopter, serial number 1610, was manufactured in 2006. The helicopter was powered by a Lycoming O-540-F1B5, 225 horsepower engine, serial number L-26556-40A. Review of the aircraft and engine logbooks revealed the last annual inspection was conducted on December 04, 2012 at an hour meter time of 749.4 total hours of operation. The hour meter was located at the crash site and read 760.2 hours. According to FAA records, the helicopter was issued a standard airworthiness certificate on October 21, 2011.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter logbook, the manufacturer's order form indicated that both spindle bearings were replaced, refurbished, and installed on the new rotor blades. When this was completed, the new rotor blades automatically incurred a reduced service life when installing used spindles. The remaining time on the new rotor blades was reduced from 2,200 hours or 12 years, whichever comes first, to match the used spindles which had about 1,439 hours or 5 years remaining, whichever came first. The rotor blades and spindles expire as a pair.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanic was hired to conduct the re-installation of the main rotor blades on the helicopter on April 3, 2013. The course of the day was spent installing the blades, making adjustments to the pitch change links, and performing a track and balance procedure that adjusts the rotor blades for the smoothest operation on the rotor system. An approximate, uneventful 1 hour test flight was conducted prior to the accident flight. - On April 3, 2013 about 1600 eastern daylight time, Robinson R44, N3101H, had components separate in flight and the helicopter impacted the ground shortly after takeoff from Kendall Tamiami Executive airport (TMB), Miami, Florida. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Bravo Helicopters, LLC, of Miami, Florida. The commercial pilot and pilot-rated mechanic incurred fatal injuries. The maintenance test flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local flight that departed a few minutes before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMultiple witnesses in the vicinity of the crash site reported hearing a loud \"pop\" noise and seeing parts separate from the helicopter as the helicopter flew overhead. Witnesses were also consistent in reporting that the empennage section of the helicopter then departed the aircraft before impact with the ground. One witness, standing about 20 feet from the impact, stated that the helicopter was inverted over the industrial buildings before it impacted two palm trees about 25 feet above ground level, a pickup truck, and then the ground. Another witness stated that the postcrash fire started after the pilot and passenger were extracted from the helicopter or about 5 minutes after the initial impact. He also stated that the helicopter was inverted over the industrial buildings. - Postmortem examinations were performed on the pilot and pilot-rated mechanic by the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner's office. The cause of death for each was reported as blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute performed forensic toxicology on specimens from the pilot and pilot-rated mechanic. The tests were negative for carbon monoxide, cyanide, drugs, and ethanol. - The TMB 1553 weather observation, located 1.5 miles west of the accident site, reported wind from 120 degrees at 12 knots, gusting to 18 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, scattered clouds at 3,000 feet above ground level, temperature 29 degrees Celsius, dew point 20 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.00 inches of mercury. - According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for helicopter and airplane single-engine land, issued on October 23, 2003. The pilot was issued a mechanic certificate on October 23, 2003, with ratings for airframe and power plant. The pilot was issued a first-class medical certificate on February 25, 2013, with the medical restriction \"must wear corrective lenses for distant and possess glasses for near vision.\" FAA records also indicated that in February of 2013, the pilot reported 6,840 total flight hours and 76 flight hours in the previous 6 months. The pilot's logbooks were not retrieved. - Several components from the rotor head system were harvested from the wreckage and sent to the NTSB Materials Laboratory in Washington, D. C. for further examination. The examination revealed that all fractures were consisted with overstress and no preexisting cracking was noted. The examination also revealed that the pitch change link attachment hole for the red blade appeared intact, free of damage, and was covered with black sooty deposits. The pitch link attachment hardware was missing from the attachment to the red blade side of the swash plate. A detailed report of the examination is contained in the NTSB public docket. - The helicopter was located upright in a parking lot on the corner of southwest 128th street and southwest 122nd avenue in Miami, Florida, and came to rest on a heading of 105 degrees magnetic (M). The debris field was 110 degrees at a distance of about 500 feet. A postcrash fire had consumed a majority of the wreckage. Several helicopter components were located on the roofs of several industrial buildings.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe red main rotor blade exhibited thermal damage about 7 feet from the hub outward towards the rotor tip, and the entire blade was upside down. The red main rotor blade data plate was missing and the alternate number was found on the inside of the tip cap as blade 3043. There was a paint scuff on the top surface of the spindle adjacent to the hub. There were impact marks on the hub from the pitch horn boot and impact marks from the pitch horn to the hub leading edge face with the leading edge, 60 degrees upward from normal orientation. The spindle was torn and there was deformation of the leading edge of the spindle bolt hole. There was a fracture from the leading edge aft, to 2.7 inches with the aft face having a journal impression. The pitch horn was fractured and deformed with impact marks immediately adjacent to the fracture surface. The pitch change link assembly remained attached to the pitch horn by the appropriate hardware. There was a torque stripe on one side of the pal nut. The rod end at the opposite end of the link assembly was unremarkable. The blade was cut 13 feet 7 inches inboard of the rotor tip for recovery. The spindle was connected and rotated roughly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe blue main rotor blade exhibited thermal damage from the hub outward about 8 feet towards the rotor tip and the entire blade was bowed down. The data plate was found installed on the blade as number 3034. Blade delamination was consistent with thermal damage. There was impact damage 4 feet 6 inches, 6 feet 6 inches, and 10 feet 10 inches from the blade tip. The blade was cut 13 feet inboard of the rotor tip for recovery. The blade tip cover and weight was in place with no chord wise scoring noted from the tip inboard on the lower surface. There was compression wrinkles on the lower surface 1 foot 7 inches inboard from the rotor tip. The blade was displaced aft about the mid span and was bowed up 3 feet inboard from the tip. There was a compression wrinkle on the upper surface 6 feet 8 inches inboard from the rotor tip. The leading edge of the upper surface exhibited chord wise scratches from the tip inboard to 7 feet that corresponded to a ground scar in the asphalt at the crash site. The upper skin was delaminated from the root of the rotor to 9 feet outboard. Upward bending started 14 feet inboard of the blade tip. The spindle was connected and rotated roughly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe upper swash plate fork remained connected to the swash plate. The yolk remained connected to the fork by the dog bone. The yolk was connected to the dog bone on both sides. The yolk was fractured on the weighted sides and was recovered from the roof top of a building. The weights were in place but damaged due to impact with the gravel roof of the industrial park building.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom exhibited a vertical scuff with white paint transfer 25.25 inches forward of the aft bulkhead, adjacent to the tail rotor blade tip arch. The intermediate flex coupling was deformed slightly, but still connected. There was rotational contact by the flex coupling with the upper frame. The tail cone was severed by the main rotor system between bays five and six during flight and came to rest 275 M about 300 feet from the initial impact point. The empennage remained attached to a 32-inch section of the tail boom, and exhibited damage to the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer. The tail rotor blades remained attached to the tail rotor gear box with one blade partially severed 9 inches outboard from the attachment point. The tail rotor rotated freely. There was fragmentation of bays five, six, and seven, at the left side where the danger sticker was adhered. This was consistent with a leading edge strike from a main rotor blade.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor driveshaft was cut 8 inches aft of the flex coupling. The tail rotor gearbox rotated freely with no abnormal noise. Tail rotor flight control continuity was examined from the pedals to the tail rotor. Several separations were noted due to overload and fire damage with no connections compromised. Main rotor flight control continuity was examined from the cyclic and collective to the main rotor blades. Several separations were noted due to overload and fire damage with no connections compromised, with the exception of the pitch link to swash plate connection for blade number 3043. The pitch link/horn departed the helicopter and was found 260 degrees M and 90 feet from the initial impact point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument panel showed crushing damage and was ripped out of the helicopter during rescue operations. All canopy screens were destroyed and fragments were found at the beginning of the debris path, on the roof of four buildings, and at the initial impact point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor mixture knob was full rich and the carburetor heat was unlocked and on. All crew and passenger seats were destroyed by postcrash fire. The pilot and passenger restraints were cut to recover the victims and were intact before the postcrash fire ensued. All restraint system harnesses were destroyed due to postcrash fire with the buckles fire damaged&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe alternator was attached to the engine and fire damaged. The alternator belt was consumed by fire. The starter was fire and impact damaged and remained attached to the engine. No vacuum pump was installed on the engine. The magnetos and ignition harness were fire damaged. The top and bottom spark plugs were removed and exhibited light gray combustion deposits and a normal wear condition with one covered in oil. The engine was rotated by hand and compression and suction was noted on all cylinders. Crankshaft and valve train continuity were confirmed to the rear gears. All cylinders were examined using a lighted bore scope and no anomalies were noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor was destroyed by impact and fire. The carburetor fuel inlet screen was removed, fire damaged, and absent of debris. All fuel lines were fire damaged. The fuel line between the fuel valve and gascolator was compromised due to impact as was the fuel inlet fitting to the carburetor. The gascolator bowl and screen were clear of debris. No fuel was observed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lower swash plate interrupter was attached to the swash plate. The slider tube was sheared from the mount and was ripped around to the top. The swash plate rotated roughly by hand.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe swash plate assembly for the blue blade exhibited a pitch link that was bent in the center section and at the lower rod end. The upper rod end fractured in a bending overload at the threaded area and remained safety wired.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe swash plate assembly for the red blade exhibited a disconnected lower rod end from the swash plate and the upper rod end remained attached to the pitch horn, which was fractured and the attached bolt was bent. The attaching hardware for the lower rod end was not recovered. There was no visible deformation damage to the pitch link mounting hole.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA detailed report of the airframe, systems, and power plant examination is contained in the NTSB public docket. -",

An examination of the helicopter and its systems revealed no malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operations. The pilot was able to egress from the helicopter; however, the passenger was not. The passenger sustained a head injury during the impact sequence. It is possible that he was unconscious and, therefore, unable to get out of the helicopter.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 26, 2013, about 1245 central daylight time, a Hughes OH-6A helicopter, N910WC, was substantially damaged when it impacted a stock pond at the Walking Cane Ranch, near Caddo, Texas. The private pilot sustained minor injuries and the passenger was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to SMR Venture, LLC., and was operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated without a flight plan. The local flight originated from Walking Cane Ranch approximately 1215. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a witness located to the east of the accident location, the helicopter flew over him and continued west. The helicopter reversed course back to the east, and approached a stock pond as if preparing to land in the adjacent field. The witness stated that the helicopter began to slow down, at which time he felt a strong gust of wind from the north, northwest. The helicopter started to descend quickly, facing west, in a 45 degree or greater bank angle. The witness glanced away and when he looked back, the helicopter continued to descend and started to spin very quickly. It appeared that the main rotor was not moving or was standing still as the helicopter spun quickly. The bank angle increased to nearly 90 degrees. The witness lost sight of the helicopter and did not see it impact the water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, he approached an open field, adjacent to the stock pond, where he had landed earlier in the day. The pilot stated that he looked for smoke or dust in order to establish the velocity and direction of the wind prior to landing but did not observe any. As he established a hover, approximately 3 to 4 feet above the ground, the pilot “sensed” a need to turn towards the east- southeast. Subsequently, the helicopter started to spin and control of the helicopter was lost despite flight control inputs. The pilot stated that the helicopter impacted the stock pond on the passenger side and immediately became submerged. The pilot was able to egress from the helicopter; however, the passenger was not.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 75, held a private pilot certificate with a helicopter and instrument rating. He was issued a third class airman medical certificate on April 9, 2012. The certificate contained the limitation must wear corrective lenses. The pilot reported that he had logged 571 hours total time; 210.3 hours were in the make and model of the accident helicopter. The pilot had successfully completed the requirements of a flight review on November 1, 2012, in the accident helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter, a Hughes OH-6A (serial number 67-16372), was registered with the Federal Aviation Administration on a standard airworthiness certificate for normal operations. An Allison 250-C20C engine rated at 375 horsepower powered the helicopter.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was maintained under an annual inspection program. The pilot reported that an annual inspection had been completed on September 5, 2012. The helicopter had 4,756.2 hours at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest official weather observation station was Stephens County Airport (KBKD), Breckenridge, Texas, located 14 nautical miles (nm) west of the accident site. The elevation of the weather observation station was 1,284 feet mean sea level (msl). The routine aviation weather report (METAR) for KBKD, issued at 1335, reported, wind 200 degrees at 6 knots, visibility 10 miles, sky condition clear, temperature 15 degrees Celsius (C), dew point temperature minus 8 degrees C, altimeter 30.38 inches.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located in in the middle of the stock pond at a GPS elevation of 1,348 feet. The helicopter came to rest on its left side and was later pulled to the shore of the pond by first responders. As it was recovered, to the shore, additional damage was incurred to the landing skids and the fuselage of the helicopter. There were no apparent ground scars associated with the accident sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage of the helicopter was on its right side, on the south shore of the stock pond when investigators arrived on scene. The wreckage included the fuselage, cabin, instrument panel, tail boom, engine, and main rotor assembly. The skin and structure of the fuselage was crushed and wrinkled in multiple locations. The left door was separated and found on top of the main wreckage. The forward bubble and windscreen were fragmented and had separated from the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cabin included both forward seats, the instrument panel and the flight controls. The left side of the fuselage structure was crushed and bent aft and to the right. The left side anti-torque pedals were separated from the mounting points. The upper frame of the left seat was bent and the left collective separate partially from the airframe. The flight controls for the cyclic, collective, and anti-torque pedals were continuous from the flight controls in the cabin aft to the main rotor, engine, and empennage. All separation points and damage were consistent with impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth forward seatbelts remained attached at their design locations. The webbing was unremarkable. The inertia real on the right side (pilots) functioned as designed. The inertia real on the left side was impact damage, preventing a functional test; however, further examination revealed no anomalies. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom remained partially attached to the helicopter, through the electrical wiring conduit, and was submerged in the water. The tail boom included the horizontal and vertical stabilizer, the tail rotor assembly, the tail rotor driveshaft, and the tail rotor gearbox. The upper and lower vertical stabilizer, and the horizontal stabilizer were unremarkable. Both tail rotor blades were covered in mud but were otherwise unremarkable. The soft stop on the tail rotor assembly separated and was not located. The tail rotor driveshaft was continuous from the point of separation aft to the tail rotor and rotated correctly without binding or issues when manually actuated. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain rotor blades 1, 2, and 3 remained attached to the helicopter at the hub/mast. All three blades were bent and wrinkled. The number 3 blade was bowed up slightly. The number 4 blade separated from the main rotor assembly and was located on the east shore of the pond. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of the engine and transmission assembly revealed that the driveshaft between the main rotor and transmission had separated, consistent with impact damage and overload at a design shear point. The compressor rotated freely when actuated by hand. Rotation was observed at the starter/generator and the first stage of the gas producer turbine. The power turbine was rotated by hand with rotation noted at the engine to transmission drive shaft and the tail rotor drive shaft. The chip detectors, engine oil screen, and engine fuel screen were free of contamination. The fuel control lever indicated 90 degrees corresponding to a “flight” throttle setting. Examination of the engine and transmission assembly revealed no anomalies that would have prevented the engine from developing designed power. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSURVIVAL ASPECTS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe autopsy on the passenger was performed by the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, Tarrant County Texas, on March 27, 2013, as authorized by the Justice of the Peace, Stephens County Texas. The autopsy concluded that the cause of death was drowning due to the helicopter accident. The report noted abrasion, bruising, and lacerations on his right forehead and right temple.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot, the accident flight was the first time that the passenger had flown with the pilot in the helicopter. Prior to the flight, the pilot helped the passenger adjust the seatbelt and shoulder harnesses. In addition, the pilot showed the passenger how to buckle and unbuckle the seatbelt. Subsequently the passenger continued to operate the seatbelt and did not appear to have any issues or difficulties doing so. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot and two mechanics were conducting a post-maintenance check flight of the helicopter's avionics system. After testing the avionics, the pilot allowed the mechanic to fly the helicopter at 1,000 feet above ground level. The mechanic maneuvered the helicopter for about 1 minute and then stated that he was transferring control of the helicopter back to the pilot. Two seconds later, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) cut off. About 1 minute after the CVR cut off, the pilot made a routine radio call to the tower controller that he was returning to land. Two minutes after this call, the pilot radioed the tower controller and his company's dispatcher, stating that he had a problem and would be landing off-airport immediately. Several ground witnesses noticed the helicopter as it flew toward the accident site, and it was making an unusual noise, described as grinding, screeching, or whistling. The helicopter impacted with a high vertical descent rate and a postcrash fire ensued.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter revealed that the main rotor and tail rotor systems had low rotational energy at the time of ground impact. Two of the tail rotor blades (yellow and red) were fractured adjacent to the tail rotor hub. The fracture signatures on the red/yellow tail rotor spar assembly were consistent with the red tail rotor blade spar initially fracturing and the red tail rotor blade departing from the tail rotor. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe resultant imbalance of the tail rotor fractured the tail gearbox (TGB) output housing studs and most likely tripped the CVR g-switch, which cut off the CVR. The yellow tail rotor blade spar fractured due to high centrifugal forces as a result of the imbalance, and the yellow blade departed from the tail rotor; the tail rotor was then rebalanced. The two remaining tail rotor blades continued to provide partial tail rotor anti-torque, and tail rotor drive remained continuous through the TGB. The entirety of the red and yellow blade separation event likely occurred very quickly, with only a momentary bump or vibration at the time of blade separation.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs the TGB output housing began to separate from the center housing, the gears likely began going out of mesh, allowing the output bevel gear to eventually contact the TGB center housing. This condition likely resulted in the loud, unusual noise reported by witnesses, as well as a drag force on the tail rotor drive system. As the pilot attempted to land, he likely shut the engines down in conjunction with an autorotative landing. Because the tail rotor drive system and main transmission remained mechanically linked, when the engines were shut down, it is likely that main rotor speed (Nr) degraded due to the compromised TGB. As a result, the helicopter developed a high vertical descent rate until ground impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe red blade spar fracture signatures were consistent with a fast-growth failure mode. Plausible fast-growth failure modes that were examined included a discrete impact event (e.g. object strike), anomalous operation of the pivot bearing, and a fracture of the pitch horn box (the structure which attaches the pitch horn to the blade and to which the pivot bearings and bumper attaches). With the lack of available evidence because the red blade was  not recovered, the specific failure mode could not be determined during the investigation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 15, 2013, about 1147 central daylight time, a Sikorsky S-76A++ helicopter, N574EH, was destroyed after ground impact near Grand Lake, Louisiana. All three occupants onboard, the pilot and two maintenance personnel, were fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to Era Helicopters LLC and was operating under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a post-maintenance check flight of avionics systems. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the local flight, which departed from Lake Charles Regional Airport (LCH), Lake Charles, Louisiana at 1119.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1120, LCH tower controller instructed the pilot to report inbound to LCH at the completion of the maintenance flight. The pilot acknowledged and advised he would remain on the LCH air traffic control (ATC) frequency. At 1145, the pilot advised LCH ATC that he was about 10 miles to the south of LCH and would be returning for landing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1146:57, the pilot called LCH tower controller and advised he had an emergency and would be immediately landing off the airport. At 11:47:02, the pilot called the Era Helicopters company dispatcher and advised that he had a problem and would be landing immediately. The wreckage of the helicopter was found about 5 miles southeast of the threshold for Runway 33 at LCH. The majority of the helicopter was consumed by a post-crash fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses noticed the accident helicopter as it flew toward the accident site. The first witness, a helicopter pilot, stated that he observed the accident helicopter in a shallow descent as it passed just east of his house about 600 feet above ground level. He stated that the helicopter was producing an unusual, grinding noise as it passed over his house. After watching the helicopter pass by his house, he walked inside his house to avoid directly viewing a possible crash. As he walked back outside, he noticed smoke plumes to the north of his house.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA second witness, a previous Navy helicopter mechanic, recorded a cell phone video of the helicopter as it passed by his position. He stated the helicopter's rotor system sounded abnormal as it flew by, making a loud, screeching noise. He stated the helicopter appeared to slow down, then the helicopter's tail rose up and it started to spin. He heard a loud boom and saw a plume of smoke. &#x0D;\nA third witness stated the helicopter was making a whistling type of noise as it flew toward LCH. At about 100 to 150 feet above the ground, he noticed the helicopter pitch down and then spin for about five revolutions. He stated that he did not hear any noise from the helicopter as it was spinning. After the helicopter impacted the ground, he noticed flames and smoke.&#x0D;\nA map of witness locations and the helicopter's flight path is located in the docket for this investigation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 69, held an airline transport pilot certificate with airplane single-engine land, rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument helicopter ratings. According to records provided by Era Helicopters, the pilot had accumulated 22,564 hours of total flight experience, with 54 hours in the last ninety days. The pilot had accumulated 850 hours of flight experience in the make and model of the accident helicopter. On February 8-9, 2013, the pilot completed recurrent training in a SK-76 simulator, which included 8 hours of flight time. Dual engine failure/autorotation and tail rotor malfunctions were accomplished during this recurrent training. &#x0D;\nOn April 2, 2012, the pilot was issued a Class 1 time limited special issuance medical certificate, which required corrective lenses be worn for near vision. During the last examination, the pilot was evaluated for his history of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and coronary artery disease requiring percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, hypothyroidism, and the use of medication. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Sikorsky S-76A++ helicopter has a four-bladed, fully articulated main rotor that provides helicopter lift and thrust, and a four-bladed flexible beam tail rotor (spar) that provides main rotor anti-torque and directional control. The helicopter is equipped with two Turbomeca Arriel 1S1 turboshaft engines that are positioned side-by-side behind the main transmission assembly. &#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter, serial number (S/N) 760369, was manufactured in 1990. Records show the helicopter had accumulated an aircraft total time (ATT) of 6,765.7 hours as of March 15, 2013. The No. 1 engine, S/N 3016, had a time since new (TSN) of 8361.10 hours and a time since overhaul (TSO) of 1475.11 hours as of March 15, 2013. The No. 2 engine, S/N 3508TEC, had a TSN of 6696.80 hours and a TSO of 1287.50 hours as of March 15, 2013.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe weather observing station at LCH reported the following conditions at 1153: wind 180 degrees at 13 knots with gusts to 19 knots, visibility 10 miles, clear skies, temperature 23 degrees Celsius, dew point 14 degrees Celsius, altimeter setting 30.05. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFLIGHT RECORDERS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA solid-state cockpit voice recorder (CVR), model L3/Fairchild FA2100-1020, was recovered at the accident site and sent to the NTSB Audio Laboratory for readout. Timing of the accident flight CVR recording was aligned with timing information provided by a time-encoded ATC recording. Other transmissions in the CVR recording were used to validate the alignment of the two recordings. &#x0D;\nA summary of the CVR is as follows:&#x0D;\n1113: The accident flight recording began, with a sound similar to an engine starting.&#x0D;\n1115: The pilot and a mechanic noted that the automatic flight control system (AFCS) test passed with no faults.&#x0D;\n1120: The mechanic noted that they needed to do a power check when they returned. The pilot agreed.&#x0D;\n1127: The mechanic asked if he could fly after the maintenance checks.&#x0D;\n1127-1142: The pilot performed a series of turns, climbs, and descents to check the avionics, flight directors, and autopilot systems. The pilot and mechanic agreed one of the two flight directors may have had a remaining problem.&#x0D;\n1142: The pilot asked the mechanic if he wanted to fly the helicopter. The mechanic agreed, and the pilot said he would set the helicopter up for the mechanic on a heading of 150 degrees at an altitude of 1,000 feet. The mechanic noted the helicopter was not like the Cessna 172 he had flown.&#x0D;\n1143:00: The pilot said to the mechanic, \"it is all yours…do anything you want with it.\"&#x0D;\n1143:06: The mechanic asked if he needed to use the pedals. The pilot said only during power changes.&#x0D;\n1143:17: Two high pitched tones, similar to an altitude alert, were recorded.&#x0D;\n1143:42: The mechanic said \"not quite as touchy as I thought it would be.\"&#x0D;\n1143:45: The pilot said, \"oh that's because I've got everything turn on.\"&#x0D;\n1143:55: The pilot said, \"What we'll do, we'll take these autopilots off. Take our forced trim off.\"&#x0D;\n1144:04: The mechanic said, \"oh yea, there we go; now I'm flying something. Okay.\" &#x0D;\n1144:10: The mechanic said, \"Okay, you got her.\"&#x0D;\n1144:12: Two or three snapping sounds were recorded on the intercom. At the same time, the cockpit area microphone recorded a sound similar to the rotor or engine RPM increasing. The two or three snapping sounds, about 0.25 seconds in length, may have been a virtual artifact of the power removal from the CVR and not a physical sound that existed in the helicopter. &#x0D;\n1144:13: The CVR recording ended.&#x0D;\nFor additional information on the CVR, see the Sound Spectrum Study and full transcript of the CVR in the docket for this investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRepresentatives from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (SAC), and Era Helicopters were present for the documentation and investigation of the helicopter accident site. Of the four tail rotor blades, two of the tail rotor blades ('yellow' and 'red') were fractured adjacent to the tail rotor hub; at the time of this report, these two tail rotor blades have not been located and recovered. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest upright on a southerly heading. The majority of the airframe, including the cockpit, main cabin, and forward portion of the tailboom, was either consumed or heavily heat distressed by the post-crash fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree of the four main rotor blades remained connected to the main rotor hub and the main rotor blade spindles were oriented at about 11 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 5 o'clock, and 8 o'clock positions when viewed from above. The 11 o'clock blade had fractured chordwise outboard of its pitch horn but was found adjacent to the main wreckage about 6 feet away. All four main rotor blades exhibited evidence consistent with low rotational energy at ground impact. The 5 o'clock and 11 o'clock blades exhibited severe chordwise deformation of the spar consistent with exposure to extreme heat. The tip cap for the 5 o'clock blade was found separated from the blade and was found about 12 feet to the east of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe majority of the main transmission case was consumed by post-crash fire, exposing its internal gears which exhibited evidence of exposure to extreme heat. The main rotor controls were continuous from the three main rotor hydraulic actuators' lower attachment fittings through the swashplate and up to the pitch control rods' connection to the pitch horns. The main rotor controls forward of the hydraulic actuators were consumed by post-crash fire, thus its continuity could not be confirmed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe two engines were found behind the main transmission and were still covered by the engine cowling. Both engines exhibited evidence of exposure to the post-crash fire. Neither engine's axial compressor showed evidence of foreign object debris ingestion. Additionally, neither engine's free turbine exhibited evidence of blade shedding. The fuel control unit throttle block remained attached to the cable and the pointer was consistent with the shutdown position, but the throttle scale had been consumed by post-crash fire. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe empennage, consisting of the vertical stabilizer and the left and right horizontal stabilizers, was found immediately aft of the main wreckage, and generally aligned with longitudinal axis of the main wreckage. The empennage was found resting on its left side (i.e. the right horizontal stabilizer was pointed almost vertically upward) with the left horizontal stabilizer fractured chordwise adjacent to the vertical stabilizer. The empennage did not exhibit evidence of heat damage apart from the forward end which connected it to the heat-distressed tailboom. The surfaces of the empennage which were not heat damaged did not exhibit evidence of soot deposits. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnly two of the four tail rotor blades (the 'black' and 'blue' blades) were recovered at the accident site. The 'black' blade had fractured from the 'black'/'blue' tail rotor spar while the 'blue' blade remained attached to the spar. The 'blue' and 'black' blade surfaces were mostly intact and did not exhibit signatures of damage associated with high rotational energy. The 'black' and 'blue' pitch change links (PCL) remained attached on both ends to the pitch beam and their respective blade pitch horns. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 'red' PCL had fractured at the pitch beam-side threads and the remainder of the 'red' PCL was not recovered. The remnant 'red' PCL remained attached to the pitch beam. The 'yellow' PCL remained whole and attached on its outboard end to the pitch beam, but the inboard rod end was observed to be free. The bolt and nut connecting the 'yellow' PCL to its respective blade pitch horn were not recovered. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDisassembly of the pitch beam and outboard retention plate revealed the 'red'/'yellow' tail rotor spar had shifted toward the 'yellow' blade side by evidence of the shifted spar nylon wraps. The elliptical plug of the 'red'/'yellow' spar exhibited crushing damage on the 'red' blade side, with the direction of crushing going toward the 'yellow' blade side.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe intermediate gearbox, tail gearbox (TGB), tail rotor head components, tail rotor blades, rotor brake, and the Nos. 3, 4, and 5 tail rotor drive shafts were retained for further examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor additional information on the wreckage, see the Airworthiness Group Chairman's Factual Report in the docket for this investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 16, 2013, an autopsy was performed on the pilot at the Calcasieu Parish Coroner's Office and Forensic Facility. The cause of death was due to blunt force injuries. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Civil Aeromedical Institute in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology tests on the pilot, which was limited by specimens suitable for testing. No ethanol was detected in the muscle or brain. Atorvastatin (Lipitor), a lipid lowering agent used to treat lipid disorders and elevated cholesterol, was detected in the liver. Carvediliol (Coreg), a prescription nonselective ß-adrenergic blocking agent used to treat heart failure and hypertension (high blood pressure), was detected in the muscle and liver. Diltiazem (Cardizem), a prescription calcium ion cellular influx inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure and angina, was detected in the liver. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of available FAA medical certificates and supporting documentation indicated the pilot had a remote heart attack treated with angioplasty (opening of coronary arteries with a balloon) and ongoing treatment with medication. On January 25, 2012, a radionuclide stress test was conducted on the pilot and read normal. On March 6, 2013, an exercise stress test/stress echocardiogram was conducted on the pilot and read normal, with normal wall motion and no evidence of ischemia. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFrom April 9-11, 2013, the Airworthiness Group, consisting of participants from the NTSB, FAA, SAC, and Era Helicopters, convened to further examine the retained components. The examination revealed signatures consistent with the 'red' tail rotor blade initially separating from the tail rotor assembly, followed by the 'yellow' tail rotor blade separating from the tail rotor assembly due to forces caused by the shift in the center of mass along the span of the 'red'/'yellow' tail rotor blade spar.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe spar fracture located near the root end of the 'red' tail rotor spar was adjacent to the 'red' blade's bumper plate. The area of the 'red' side bumper plate exhibited a slight bowing in the outboard direction (when looking outboard from the pylon-side of the spar). The remnant adhesive layout for the 'red' blade's pivot bearing retainer was observed on the spar fracture. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the remnant adhesive layout under a scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed no definitive direction that the layout fibers were pulled. The fracture had a broomstraw appearance, with the broomstraw appearance more prevalent near the central width of the spar. Examination of the fracture under a SEM revealed no evidence consistent with composite matrix rubbing due to delamination. &#x0D;\nThe opposing spar fracture on the 'yellow' side was located near the edge of the retention plate. The 'red'/'yellow' spar had S/N \"A-116-01207\" stenciled on the surface of the spar. The spar fracture had an overall blunt and flat appearance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nX-ray examination of the remnant 'red'/'yellow' spar and the 'black'/'blue' spar showed no evidence of \"waviness\" of the composite filaments in the undamaged areas. The 'black' and the 'blue' tail rotor blades exhibited no evidence of damage consistent with high rotational energy at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe TGB was examined and contained only traces of oil. No oil sample was submitted with the TGB. The TGB was not drained of oil when it was recovered at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe output housing of the TGB, containing the output bevel gear, was separated from the center housing; the mounting hardware for the tail rotor quadrant, spring capsules, and pulleys were holding the output housing to the center housing. Rotation of the input pinion by hand did not engage the output bevel gear. There was no evidence of binding when the input pinion was rotated. Rotation of the output bevel gear by hand revealed no evidence of binding. The pitch change shaft rotated in unison with the output bevel gear. The TGB exhibited no signatures of damage to its internal bearings. Additionally, the TGB housing exhibited no discoloration of its external paint or internal coatings consistent with heat distress. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe output bevel gear and output housing were removed from the TGB center housing as a single assembly. The splines and threads on the outboard end of the bevel gear exhibited no signatures of damage. The lock washer, large nut, and tapered split cone exhibited no signatures of damage. The top land of the output bevel gear teeth exhibited damage from the tooth heel to about 1/3 of the length of the top land. One of the twelve bolts securing the output bevel gear to the output gear shaft was fractured; the fracture surface exhibited signatures of overload. Small metallic flakes were found throughout the output bevel gear surfaces and the inner diameter of the output gear shaft. The flanges of the output housing that attaches to the center housing were fractured. The flanges remained attached to the center housing with their respective attaching nuts. All observed fracture surfaces of the output housing exhibited signatures consistent with overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe nuts securing the input pinion and housing assembly to the center housing remained installed and intact. The input pinion and input housing were removed from the TGB center housing as a single assembly. The top land surface of the input pinion gear teeth exhibited damage from the tooth heel to about one half of the length of the top land. The driving and coasting surfaces of the input pinion gear teeth did not exhibit signatures of abnormal operation or of foreign object damage (FOD) ingestion through the gear mesh. Small metallic flakes were found throughout the surfaces of the input pinion.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe exterior of the center housing exhibited no signatures of cracks or fractures aside from those associated with the fracture of the output housing. Small metallic flakes were found throughout the interior surfaces of the center housing and a trace amount of oil was found inside the housing. On the center housing, impressions of output bevel gear teeth impacting the sealing surface (the inner diameter mating surface) to the output housing were seen from about the 3 o'clock to the 8 o'clock position; the impressions were consistent with impact from a non-rotating output bevel gear. Damage to the center housing with an appearance similar to machining was found adjacent to the sealing surface from about the 7 o'clock to the 12 o'clock position; this damage was consistent with impact from a rotating output bevel gear. Additional static gear tooth impressions were found on the damaged area with the machined appearance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 5, 2013, the 'blue' and 'black' tail rotor blades were brought to the Feather Identification Lab in Washington, District of Columbia (DC), part of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, to determine if there was evidence of snarge (bird remains) on the blades. Additionally, on September 24, 2013, a specialist from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Wildlife Services in Louisiana examined the tail rotor area of the helicopter wreckage for evidence of snarge. No evidence of bird remains consistent with a bird strike were found on the components.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBecause of the relatively low time in service from the 'red'/'yellow' blade assembly's last 1,500 hour spar inspection (5.9 flight hours), the Airworthiness Group examined the S-76 tail rotor 1,500-hour inspection procedures for deficiencies and maintenance actions that could either damage the spar or affect the stresses on the spar. One particular action that was examined concerning the spar inspection is removal of the pivot bearing. Pivot bearing compression screws are used to compress the pivot bearings in order to remove them from the tail rotor blade assembly. Within the pivot bearing replacement procedures, found in Sikorsky S-76 Maintenance Manual No. SA 4047-76AA-2, exists a caution during the installation of the pivot bearings that states: \"Ground support compression screw is not flight hardware. Make sure compression screw is removed before completing maintenance.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 23, 2014, the Airworthiness Group, consisting of representatives from the NTSB, FAA, SAC, Bell Helicopter, and Era Helicopters, convened at Bell Helicopter Broussard to perform testing on a scrap tail rotor blade set to determine whether a tail rotor blade could be fully assembled with the compression screw still installed in the pivot bearing and the likelihood of detecting the compression screw. The Airworthiness Group determined that a tail rotor blade could be assembled with the compression screw installed. Additionally, a tail rotor blade assembled with a compression screw left installed in the pivot bearing was visually no different than one without a compression screw left installed in the pivot bearing. However, a tactile inspection of the tail rotor blade revealed a noticeable increase in the force required to pitch and flap a blade with a compression screw still installed in the pivot bearing versus a blade without the compression screw installed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Airworthiness Group also performed a tail rotor blade spar \"flex check\" on a known cracked blade spar and determined that the audible sound made by a cracked spar was relatively quiet. The Airworthiness Group determined that a compression screw within the pivot bearing would increase the stiffness of the pivot bearing and could affect the bending stresses on the spar during blade flapping, though no testing was done to determine what affect this stiffness would have on the pivot bearing in operation.&#x0D;\nFor additional information on tests and research, see the Airworthiness Group Chairman's Factual Report in the docket for this investigation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMAINTENANCE HISTORY OF TAIL ROTOR BLADE ASSEMBLY &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 'red'/'yellow' blade assembly, S/N A137-00708X, was manufactured by SAC on June 14, 1984. The spar, part number (P/N) 76101-05017-045 and S/N A116-01207, was manufactured on May 16, 1984. According to maintenance records, all life limited components to blade assembly S/N A137-00708X were original since blade assembly manufacture with the exception of both pitch horns, which were replaced on October 25, 2007 due to the original pitch horns exceeding their life limit of 12,000 hours. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBlade assembly S/N A137-00708X was last removed from a different helicopter (N578EH) on January 7, 2012, with the cause for removal listed as paint erosion and a 1500 hour inspection that was due. Blade assembly S/N A137-00708X was subsequently sent to a Bell Helicopter Broussard, formerly Rotor Blades Inc. (RBI), in Broussard, Louisiana. Work performed on the blade assembly by Bell Helicopter Broussard, under work order no. S76T-137-00708, included replacement of the polyurethane strips, rubber boots, and compliance with the 500-hour and 1500-hour inspections. The airworthiness approval tag (FAA form 8130-3) for blade assembly S/NA137-00708X, signed on March 22, 2012, stated the blade was also refinished and balanced. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Era Helicopters, blade assembly S/N A137-00708X was kept in storage at Era Helicopters' facilities in Lake Charles, Louisiana until January 29, 2013, when the blade assembly was installed on the accident helicopter. On January 29, 2013, the ATT was 6,759.8 flight hours and blade assembly S/N A137-00708X had a time since new (TSN) of 14,800.5 flight hours. The accident helicopter accumulated about 5.9 flight hours from the 'red'/'yellow' blade installation onto N574EH until the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter blade assembly S/N A137-00708X was installed on the accident helicopter, maintenance records showed that an airworthiness check was performed on March 3, 2013 using the criteria required by the Era S-76 helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) approved airworthiness inspection program (AAIP). The airworthiness check was directed by an Era Helicopters Fleet Campaign Directive (FCD) No. FCD-000119-2012, which required a maintenance supervisor or lead to perform an airworthiness check of the aircraft with the technician. The S-76 HEMS AAIP airworthiness check requires inspection of the tail rotor blades for cracks, security, and condition, including a tail rotor spar flex check and force-deflection check. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 7, 2013, maintenance records showed that an Era technician performed a tail rotor balance 'light on wheels' inspection on the accident helicopter. This tail rotor balance inspection was approved by an Era supervisor on March 9, 2013. On March 10, 2013, a S-76 HEMS AAIP airworthiness check was accomplished as a final maintenance action to approve the helicopter for flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHISTORICAL S-76 TAIL ROTOR SPAR FAILURE INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn August 19, 1991, a Sikorsky S-76A+ helicopter, S/N 760223, performed a precautionary landing on an offshore platform after the crew experienced a heavy vibration that lasted about 4 seconds. The precautionary landing took place about 15 minutes after the crew experienced the heavy vibrations. Upon landing, two opposing tail rotor blades were found to have departed the tail rotor. The missing tail rotor blades were never recovered. A small central section of the affected spar was found between the retention plates. The affected components were sent to SAC's materials engineering lab for investigation. Lab examination revealed evidence consistent with one of the tail rotor blades fracturing first, and the resultant shift in the center of gravity and imbalance in centrifugal forces led to the opposing blade to eventually fracture as well. The remnant spar did not show evidence of ply waviness consistent with a manufacturing anomaly, rubbing of the plies consistent with spar delamination, or a material defect. The tail gearbox housing exhibited a partially circumferential overload fracture across three of the flanges used to attach the output housing to the center housing. Maintenance records revealed the tail rotor spar had a TSN of 1,571 hours, with 1,507 hours accumulated on the incident helicopter. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The emergency medical services helicopter departed a hospital helipad in dark night visual flight rules conditions and proceeded on its mission. Satellite data showed that, after takeoff, the helicopter began a gradual climb toward its planned destination. The data stopped about 3 minutes and 30 seconds into the flight. No distress calls were heard from the pilot. Fixed video surveillance cameras located near the accident site showed the last few seconds of the helicopter descending toward the ground. The helicopter impacted a parking lot, and a postimpact fire occurred. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  Examination of the wreckage revealed that three of the engine's first-stage axial compressor blades exhibited deformation consistent with soft body foreign object damage. The remainder of the engine and airframe exhibited no evidence of malfunction that would have contributed to an in-flight loss of engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  The helicopter's air intake design, which had been modified to accommodate a different engine than that originally supplied by the helicopter's manufacturer, incorporated a blanking plate attached to the top side of the engine cowling that covered a portion of the air inlet screen. A gap in the area where the blanking plate and the screen overlapped made it possible, in certain meteorological conditions, for water or snow to pass through the screen, accumulate on the blanking plate, and freeze into ice. Ice accumulation in this area, if left undetected, could result in the ice detaching from the blanking plate and entering the engine during operation, causing soft body foreign object damage and a loss of engine power. Precipitation and outside temperatures ranging from 35 to 19 degrees F occurred during the 12-hour period preceding the accident. The combination of these meteorological conditions was conducive to the formation and accumulation of ice in the area between the air inlet screen and the blanking plate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  Although the helicopter's flight manual supplement for cold weather operations recommended installation of an air inlet cover after the last flight of the day, during the day and night before the flight, the helicopter was parked outside on the helipad without an air inlet cover installed. According to the helicopter's mechanic, he inspected the helicopter on the afternoon before the flight and noted that some snow had accumulated on it. It is likely that the lack of an engine air inlet cover allowed precipitation to accumulate in the vicinity of the engine air intake.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  The helicopter's flight manual cold weather operations supplement also contained instructions for the pilot to perform a visual and manual (tactile) inspection of the air intake duct up to the first-stage compressor for evidence of snow and ice. Furthermore, the manufacturer and the Federal Aviation Administration had previously released information notices regarding inflight loss of engine power due to snow or ice ingestion caused by inadequate inspection or removal of snow or ice from the engine air inlet. These notices recommended a thorough inspection in and around the engine inlet area in order to detect and remove any snow or ice accumulation before flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  The initial on-scene examination found no remnants of ice or snow on these components because exposure to the postcrash fire would have melted such evidence. Surveillance video of the helipad showed that most of the helipad lights were off at the time of the pilot's preflight inspection immediately before the flight, making it difficult for him to detect any ice or snow accumulation in the area of the engine air intake. Thus, the ice accumulation between the air inlet screen and the blanking plate remained undetected, and shortly after takeoff, the ice detached from the blanking plate, slid into the air inlet, and was subsequently ingested by the engine, resulting in an in-flight loss of engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  .",
    "FactualNarrative": "Notices Related to Operating in Cold Weather Conditions&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEurocopter released Information Notice No. 2302-I-00 (Revision 0 dated April 5, 2011) regarding engine flameout or damage when the aircraft had previously been subjected to cold weather in snowy or rainy conditions and parked in the open. The Information Notice states that \"a turbine engine is susceptible to a 'sudden quantity' of water, snow, or ice, because this quantity (even limited) corresponds to a very high instantaneous concentration exceeding its absorption capacities.\" The Information Notice contains recommendations for the prevention of this issue and precautions to be taken in cold weather when temperatures are close to or below freezing (32 Degrees° F or 0 Degrees C).  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA released Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB) No. SW-08-03R3, dated January 17, 2013, regarding in-flight loss of engine power due to snow or ice ingestion. The FAA released SAIB No. SW-08-03R3 in response to the NTSB's findings of an accident on January 2, 2013 involving a Eurocopter EC130 B4 which experienced an in-flight loss of engine power. The SAIB describes that snow or ice can accumulate in the engine intakes and plenums while the aircraft is on the ground with the engine(s) not operating or at a low power setting for an extended period of time. When the pilot increases the engine power during takeoff, the accumulated snow and ice can separate from the engine air inlet and be ingested by the engine, resulting in a decrease in power or a complete loss of engine power. The SAIB also contains recommendations for the prevention of this issue. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPost Accident Safety Actions &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to the findings from this investigation, EagleMed has painted the blanking plate adjacent to the air intake screen a matte black color to enhance detection of moisture, including ice formation, which may accumulate on the flat plate. The inspection of the engine air intake was modified such that any signature of moisture on the flat plate would result in additional inspections to the air intake area, including opening the engine cowling to ensure a thorough inspection of the air inlet scrolls.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEagleMed has also begun to carry engine air intake covers at all times. This is an effort to reduce the accumulation of moisture and ice in the area of the air inlet and air inlet scrolls in case the helicopter is forced to park outside during rainy or snowy weather conditions. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHoneywell released Pilot Advisory Letter No. PAL TS-01 (dated October 8, 2013) recommending all pilots, chief pilots, and flight operations managers review FAA SAIB No. SW-08-03R3. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEurocopter has released Safety Information Notice No. 2645-S-30 (Revision 0 dated October 31, 2013) regarding ice and rain protection recommendations. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Rotorcraft Directorate released SAIB No. SW-08-03R4 (dated November 26, 2013) for continued emphasis on precautions to take for rotorcraft operations during icing and snowy conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNote: The type certificate holder for the Eurocopter AS350B2 was changed to Airbus Helicopters Inc., on January 1, 2014. - The Eurocopter AS350 B2 helicopter, also known as the \"AStar\", was originally equipped with a single Turbomeca Arriel 1D1 turboshaft engine, mounted behind the main transmission, which provides power to the main and tail rotor systems. On the accident helicopter, the operator had replaced the Turbomeca engine with a Honeywell (formerly Lycoming) LTS101-700D-2 turboshaft engine under Soloy Aviation Solutions supplemental type certificate (STC) No. SR01647SE on July 30, 2008.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe-supplied engine air intake system was modified to accommodate the Honeywell LTS101 engine under the same STC. An optional inlet air filter kit, manufactured by Aerospace Filtration Systems (AFS), was offered as part of STC No. SR01647SE if installed at the time of the LTS101 engine conversion, or under STC No. SR02393CH if installed after the LTS101 engine conversion was performed; the inlet air filter kits under both STCs are identical in design. Neither of the inlet air filter kits was installed on the accident helicopter. According to soloy, the design of the air intake system for STC SR01647SE is virtually identical to the design of the Airbus Helicopters  AS350D equipped with a LTS 101-600A2 engine. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe LTS101-700D-2 engine installed on the helicopter at the time of the accident was serial number (S/N) LE-46036C, which was installed on the accident helicopter on June 8, 2012. According to the engine data plate, the date of manufacture for engine S/N LE-46036C was September 1983. Prior to the accident flight, the engine had accumulated a total time of 8,568.1 hours since new (TSN) and the helicopter accumulated a total (Hobbs) time of 6,473.6 hours. Refer to the Maintenance Group Chairman's Factual Report for more information on the maintenance history of engine S/N LE-46036C.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Honeywell LTS101-700D-2 engine is a dual-spool turboshaft that features a single-stage axial compressor and a single-stage centrifugal compressor, a reverse flow annular combustor, a single stage turbine rotor that drives the compressor, an accessory gearbox, and a power turbine rotor that drives the helicopter's main and tail rotors. The LTS101-700D-2 engine's maximum takeoff power rating is 732 shaft horsepower (shp) and a maximum continuous power rating of 650 shp, both of which are flat-rated to 72 Degrees F.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNOTE: The Maintenance Group Chairman's Report is available in this Report's Public Docket. - On February 22, 2013, approximately 0542 central standard time, an Eurocopter AS350B2 emergency medical service (EMS) configured helicopter, N917EM, registered to Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc., care of EagleMed LLC, of Wichita Kansas, impacted in the parking lot of St. Ann's Retirement Home located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The flight was being conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91 as a repositioning flight. The intent of the flight was a prescribed inter-hospital transfer of a cardiac patient from the Watonga Municipal Hospital to the University of Oklahoma Medical Center. Of the three crewmembers onboard, the commercial pilot and flight nurse sustained fatal injuries and the paramedic sustained serious injuries. Dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed in the vicinity along the route of flight and accident site and a company flight plan was filed with EagleMed flight dispatch control. The flight originated from the Integris Baptist Hospital (OK19) helipad at 0538 and its intended destination was Watonga, Oklahoma.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSkyConnect satellite data showed that the helicopter departed OK19 and began a gradual climb on a northwest bearing toward Watonga. The data stopped approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds into the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFixed video surveillance cameras located on a building adjacent to the parking lot showed the last few seconds of the helicopter descending toward the ground. The video showed that the helicopter burst into flames upon impact. From the initial impact point, the debris path was approximately 75 feet in length, on a heading of 065 degrees magnetic. All of the impact signatures were consistent with a right side low (approximate 40 degree) attitude, with a high rate of descent. Using the geometry of impact signatures and adjacent structures clearance, the helicopter's angle of descent was approximately 25 degrees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitness Statement Summaries &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitness 1 was a person who was driving in the vicinity of the accident site reported that he distinctly observed a \"flash\" in the sky in front of him. After the flash, he saw the helicopter in an increasingly rapid descent before it disappeared behind buildings. He then drove toward an area where smoke was emanating and saw that the helicopter was on fire in the parking lot of St. Ann's. He immediately assisted others (St. Ann's employees) in pulling the surviving paramedic away from the burning aircraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitness 2 was a resident of St. Ann's and her apartment was on the third floor. The window from which she observed the helicopter impact area faced in an approximate south-easterly direction. She was awake in her bedroom when she heard the helicopter come over, followed by the sound of the crash-impact. She said it sounded like the helicopter came over her building from the north and that it sounded like a very loud motor-type sound. It was a constant sound, not cutting in and out up to the time of the impact. When she heard the impact, she ran to her window and saw the helicopter on fire and people running out to assist. She said after the initial impact, there were two more explosions. One of the two explosions blew out her next door neighbor's window. It was dark outside at the time.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitness 3 arrived at St. Ann's for work about 0540.  She was parking her car and saw the helicopter flying nose down but appeared to be normal.  The helicopter seemed to hover as if looking for a place to land.  I thought it was a normal landing, then, the helicopter started to angle down as if trying to land.  Then the helicopter touched down and the impact wasn't violent but a fire started. She went inside, pulled the alarm and announced \"fire\" and grabbed an extinguisher and ran back out. She made eye contact with one of the persons in the wreckage and tried to pull him out, then, another St. Ann's employee came and pulled him out.  Another man came up and helped and there was another explosion as the St. Ann's employees were trying to pull persons from the wreckage. The Fire Department showed up and took over.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitness 4 was sitting in her car when she saw the helicopter \"fall.\" The helicopter was heading toward her car when it hit the ground and skidded into an embankment. All of this happened in a few seconds. There was a fire immediately upon impact.  She heard a \"screech\" sound that lasted a few seconds prior to impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitness 5 was in his home preparing to go on duty with the Oklahoma County Sheriff's Office. He heard what sounded like the EagleMed helicopter approaching from the southeast. He stated that this indicated a recent lift off from Integris Baptist or possibly one of the other Oklahoma City hospitals located in that general direction. He said that the particular type of aircraft used by EagleMed makes a very distinct sound and it is not hard to distinguish from other helicopters. As the helicopter flew over his house, the engine of the helicopter very suddenly powered down so quickly that the engine noise became silent. He was not certain as to what altitude the aircraft was at, but before the engine went silent, it sounded as though it was maybe 500 to 600 feet above the house. This estimation was made from having lived in the Wiley Post Airport (PWA) flight path for several years and observing different aircraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHe stated that he was inside his home at the time and did not physically see the helicopter. When he heard the engine go silent, he glanced at the clock and noted that it showed 0542. In the ensuing few moments after glancing at the clock, he wondered what was going on. It was then that an explosion shook the walls and windows of every home in the area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNOTE: Additional and Complete Witness Statements are Included in the Docket&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSummary of Interview with EagleMed Integris Hospital Base Pilot (Prior Shift)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe prior shift pilot stated that she had spoken with the EagleMed base mechanic at the Integris Hospital crew quarters on the afternoon of February 21st. They talked about the weather and the mechanic told her that he was concerned about precipitation melting in the tail area and re-freezing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nShe stated that the accident pilot arrived for his night shift on the evening of the 21st between 1840 and 1845, which was about 20 minutes later than he normally arrived, due to traffic.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n She stated that when inclement weather was coming in, they would normally fly the helicopter to a nearby company hangar. About 2200, several hours after she went off shift, she sent a message to the accident pilot to warn him that it was icing over outside due to the cold weather and asked him not to fly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSummary of Interview with EagleMed Base Mechanic&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe base mechanic last saw the accident helicopter parked on the Integris Hospital helipad on February 21st, about 1430. The helicopter had been out of service due to inclement weather. He knew that there was a hard freeze coming and went to check on the helipad to clear off any snow/ice that had accumulated on and around the helicopter.  He took a shovel with him and cleared slush and snow off the sidewalk, the area around the helicopter, and the drain nearby.  At that time he also generally inspected the condition of the helicopter. During this general inspection, he looked up on the top of main rotor, the engine inlet, canopy, exhaust duct, and horizontal stabilizer for snow/ice accumulation. He noted that engine inlet plugs, pitot plugs, or covers were not installed. Early in the interview, he stated that there was a little bit of residual accumulation in the engine inlet, and there was some accumulation in the exhaust duct which he cleaned out.  Later in the interview, he stated there was no accumulation in the engine inlet. He said there was some snow/slush on the horizontal stabilizer which he removed with a brush. He also checked fluid levels, pitch links, and the tail rotor, which seemed fine. He looked around the pad for leaking fluids and noted none. At that time, it was drizzling and wet outside. The temperature was above freezing, and the accumulation was melting.  He stated that he was generally concerned about removing any moisture because of the freeze warning.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the mechanic went inside to visit with the crew, he talked with the pilot (prior shift pilot) about the weather. They walked outside under a covered area and discussed that it wasn't clear enough to fly at that time. He said the pilot said she had been checking the weather every hour and that it wasn't looking good.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanic further commented that when he was out on the helipad with the helicopter he did not open the cabin doors, but he noticed that the aircraft cabin heater was plugged in.  He also added that the windows were polished recently to help prevent moisture accumulation. When asked whether any plugs or covers were normally installed over the engine inlet or pitot tube when it was parked, he said no.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen the mechanic was asked whether he or the crew perceived any pressure from the hospital when the aircraft was out of service due to weather, he said no.  When asked whether he perceived that the aircraft would remain out of service for the foreseeable future due to weather, he said yes.  When asked when he expected that the daily inspection would be accomplished, he said he expected that the pilot on duty (the accident pilot) would perform the daily inspection later that evening.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNOTE: Complete Statements of the Prior Shift Pilot and Base Mechanic are Included in the Docket - On February 25, 2013, an autopsy on the pilot was completed by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. No evidence of any medical conditions were found that could have contributed to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological analysis revealed no evidence of drugs, ethyl alcohol (ethanol), or carbon monoxide. - On the morning of the accident, at 0453, an automated weather reporting facility at the Wiley Post Airport (PWA), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, reported wind from 340 degrees at 10 knots, visibility 10 statute miles, temperature 19 degrees Fahrenheit (F), dew point 12 degrees F, and a barometric pressure of 30.02 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe day prior to the accident, on February 21, 2013, METAR data from PWA reported 0.07 inches of precipitation in the last 6 hours at 1153 while METAR data from Will Rogers World Airport (OKC) reported 0.14 inches of precipitation in the last 6 hours at 1152 CST. METAR data from WPA and OKC reported trace precipitation from 1553 CST to 1752 CST with temperatures around 35°F. The Integris Hospital Helipad (OK19) is about 3 miles east of PWA and about 8 miles north of OKC. METAR data from PWA reported that temperatures fell consistently from a high of 35°F (recorded at 1753 on February 21, 2013) to a low of 19°F (recorded at 0753 on February 22, 2013).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION  (On Site)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe majority of the helicopter structure was thermally damaged consistent with a post-impact fire, and fragmented from impact forces localized in the area of its final resting location. The majority of the burned structure debris indicated the aircraft came to rest in the upright position. The energy debris path was approximately 75 feet in length and on a heading of 065 degrees. All the impact signatures were consistent with a right side low (approximately 40 degrees) attitude, with a forward movement from a high rate of descent. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuselage was broken open (both doors were separated from the fuselage and found near the main wreckage and damaged from the impact and post-impact fire), the medical litter, the pilot's seat and rear seats remained inside the aircraft. The pilot's seat was a conventional bucket type seat; the seat was burned away from the floor and leaning forward.  A 4-point seat restraint buckle was found clasped together in the ash of the wreckage.  The 4 steel frames of the aft medical service seats remained mounted to the aft bulkhead. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 'Starflex' remained in the center of the rotor hub; however, all of the star arms and sleeves were thermally damaged. All three of the main rotor blades remained attached to the rotor head and mast. The leading edges of each blade exhibited light impact damage; the tips of each blade were bent up. One of the MRB tips was missing its tracking finger and static and dynamic balance weights. Ground scars consistent to low rotor RPM from the main rotor blades were found near the final wreckage resting place.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail section (which includes the tail-boom, tail-rotor gear box, rotor blades, drive shaft and pitch change system) was separated from the main fuselage at the forward tail cone attach point from thermal distress. The right horizontal stabilizer was damaged from impact forces, bending up approximately 50 degrees. Almost no damage was observed to the left horizontal stabilizer. The tail ventral fin and stinger were bent up and aft, consistent with a forward flight path at impact. The tail rotor blades were damaged at the hub consistent with lateral impact forces. Both blade tips had dirt debris consistent with rotation at ground contact, and ground scars were present matching the tail rotor blade tips. The ventral fin and tail skid had correlated ground impact signatures in the same area as the tail rotor, consistent with a 40-degree angle, right side low. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTail rotor drive continuity was confirmed when the tail rotor drive was manually turned by hand. Tail rotor pitch change continuity was confirmed to each blade by the manual actuation of the pitch change tube. The forward tail rotor drive shaft was found still connected to the engine, and the tail rotor drive shaft flex coupling to the aft drive shaft exhibited minor distortion.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main transmission was found attached to the helicopter structure, relatively intact and attached to the engine and the rotor mast assembly. The transmission drive shaft was still connected to the engine and the forward flex coupling to the main transmission input. The main rotor to transmission continuity could not be confirmed due to the impact and thermal damage to the main rotor drive system. A slight bend was observed in the rotor mast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel tank was not recognizable in the wreckage. Only small pieces of the composite fuel tank structure were found lying around the accident site. The odor and visual evidence of a fuel splash, post-crash fire was observed at the accident site. A Michigan Dynamic supplemental airframe fuel filter system was found loose among the wreckage. No fuel was observed in the fuel filter bowl, and a trace amount of debris was in the bottom of the filter bowl. All fuel lines were consumed by the post-impact fire. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument panel was fragmented, thermally damaged and separated from the airframe. Most of the instruments were not readable due to the thermal damage and burned loose lengths of wiring were found in the area of the forward cabin. The caution warning panel and the avionics panel where thermally damaged and unable to provide switch or light conditions.  According to EagleMed, the instrument panel was configured for the Night Vision Goggle (NVG) operations, and a set of NVGs were found in the wreckage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe collective control was found in the full down position and was heavily damaged from fire and separated from the structure of the aircraft along with the throttle quadrant area (i.e. the rotor brake, fuel flow control, and fuel shut-off control levers).  The fuel-shut off control was full forward/down. The rotor brake handle was stowed. The fuel flow control lever was in the flight position. All the hydraulic servo actuators were accounted for and relatively intact and partially attached to the rotor control system; however, thermally damaged. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth the cyclic, collective, and anti-torque pedals push-pull control tubes were thermally damaged and separated under the cabin floor areas running aft in the helicopter. The cyclic control yoke was free and easy to move, the friction lock was loose. Flight control continuity could not be confirmed due to the thermally decayed condition of the wreckage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing gear was separated at the forward and aft cross tubes on the right side, about mid-span. The ground signatures on the concrete in the parking lot, correlated to the right side of the right landing gear skid, also consistent with the helicopter contacting the ground about 40-degrees attitude, right side low.   &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was found directly aft of the main transmission. The engine was laying on its right side attached to the lower engine deck by the right engine mount, which was standing on edge, and covered on its left side by a partially burned engine access panel. The engine was covered in soot, particularly on its right side.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe upper and lower air inlet scrolls were in place and remained together. The air inlet scrolls were thermally distressed and easily separated when touched. The air inlet screen from the top of the helicopter was separated from the engine cover and found nearby in the wreckage. The air inlet screen was bent and distorted with the appearance of exposure to the post-impact fire; the screen did not have any holes in the mesh. The engine's exhaust pipe was in place on the combustor plenum. The end of the pipe was bent radially inward and forward between the 5 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions. The interior surfaces of the exhaust duct and struts did not exhibit impact damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe axial compressor rotor remained in place and could be turned slightly by hand. The fuel manifolds remained in place and the manifold heat shields were partially burned. There was no indication of leakage from any of the manifolds. The power turbine (PT) blades were all in place and did not exhibit damage. The PT blades could not be rotated by hand.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine throttle lever was disconnected from the throttle cable; there was about 4.5 inches of extension of the cable out of the shield. The PT speed set cable was extended out of the shield by about 6 inches and was not connected to the PT governor lever. The emergency fuel shutoff valve was broken off at the fitting. The engine-mounted fuel filter housing was partially melted and broken open, exposing the filter element. The airframe-mounted fuel filter housing was found intact and covered with soot, but the attaching fuel hoses were consumed by the post-crash fire. Trace amounts of debris were observed in the bottom of the airframe-mounted fuel filter bowl. The electronic overspeed governor was located to the left of the engine and was thermally distressed. - The pilot was employed with EagleMed since February, 2011. He held a valid Commercial Helicopter Pilot Certificate with an Instrument Helicopter rating. His most recent FAA medical certificate, Second Class, was dated January 1, 2013, with no limitations or waivers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's total flight time was 4,960 hours (3,702 hours Pilot-in-Command), all of which were in helicopters. His total time in the AS350B2 helicopter was 202 hours. His most recent annual training was completed on January 15, 2013, which included practice autorotations and simulated engine failure scenarios. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe EagleMed chief pilot reported that the pilot was in good health, had a great sense of professional conduct, and did not have any extraordinary events in the previous 72 hours prior to the accident. He worked his normal shifts and seemed to be well rested. - Documentation of the Integris Hospital Helipad (OK19) &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA search of the helipad at OK19 did not reveal any evidence of debris. A fixed surveillance video of the helipad immediately prior to the helicopter's departure for the accident flight revealed most of the helipad lights were off. In comparison, the surveillance video from the two evenings prior showed all helipad lights were on, completely illuminating the helipad. According to the helicopter mechanic, the day prior to the accident, the helicopter was forced to park outside and overnight on the helipad due to adverse weather conditions. Typically, the helicopter would be parked inside a hanger at a different location. According to the helicopter mechanic, the helicopter did not have the engine air inlet cover and exhaust blank installed while the helicopter was parked on the helipad and exposed to precipitation. The helicopter remained exposed to low temperatures overnight. The helicopter mechanic stated he had last examined the helicopter at about 1430 the day before the accident and that during his last examination, he discovered residual snow and slush had accumulated on the top surfaces of the helicopter and the horizontal stabilizer. A broom was used to brush off the accumulated snow and slush. The on-scene examination found no remnants of ice or snow on these components because exposure to the post-crash fire would have melted such evidence. The operator stated the pilot performed a preflight inspection immediately prior to the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Examination and Teardown &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was removed from the wreckage and transported to Honeywell facilities in Phoenix, Arizona. On March 7, 2013, members of the Powerplants Group convened at Honeywell to perform an engine examination and teardown. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGeneral &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe external condition of the engine was visually examined. The insulation had melted from the majority of the electrical wiring. There was soot on the engine, particularly on the right side of the accessory gearbox and on both sides of the combustor plenum at about the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions. The airframe-supplied front and rear drive shafts remained installed. The forward driveshaft was not deformed. The cover over the forward driveshaft was partially burned and melted down onto the driveshaft. The rear driveshaft was fractured about 13 inches aft of the forward coupling. The forward coupling of the rear driveshaft did not exhibit evidence of deformation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PT rotor could be rotated by hand with light finger pressure. When the forward driveshaft stub shaft was rotated in the clockwise direction, the rear driveshaft and PT rotor turned concurrently confirming continuity and engagement of the freewheeling clutch7. When the forward driveshaft stub shaft was rotated in the counterclockwise direction, the rear driveshaft rotated concurrently, but the PT rotor did not turn, consistent with disengagement of the freewheeling clutch.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAir Inlet Section &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe upper air inlet scroll duct was in place on the lower air inlet scroll duct. However, the upper and lower air inlet scroll ducts were separated on the left side and the strap was separated from the clamp. The upper air inlet scroll duct was partially broken away on the left side, about halfway down the duct. The upper rear frame of the upper air inlet scroll duct was displaced forward. The right side of the upper air inlet scroll duct had several splits and areas burned through. The right side of the interior of the upper air inlet scroll duct was sooted. The optional anti-ice system, Honeywell kit No. 4-201-080-01, was not installed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe lower air inlet scroll duct was in place. The lower air inlet scroll duct exhibited delamination in several locations. Debris, including several pieces of re-solidified molten metal, was found lying in the bottom of the lower air inlet scroll duct. The left side drain on the lower air inlet scroll duct was open, but the right side drain was blocked with debris from the wreckage. The compressor inlet housing was intact. The exterior of the compressor inlet housing was sooted. The 12 bolts attaching the compressor inlet housing to the air diffuser housing flange were tight. The air diffuser housing was intact and did not exhibit evidence of damage. No evidence of bird remains was found in the air inlet scroll ducts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCompressor Section&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe No. 1 bearing was intact, wet with oil, and free to rotate. The bearing balls were in good condition. The disk portion of the axial compressor rotor was intact. The disk bore and rim were coated with soot. All of the axial compressor blades remained in place. Two axial compressor blades exhibited leading edge tip curling deformation in the direction opposite of rotation consistent with soft body object impact damage. One of the deformations was observed to be about 0.344 inches chordwise and the other deformation was observed to be about 0.406 inches chordwise. A dent about 0.031 inches chordwise was observed on the leading edge of a third axial compressor blade. After the axial compressor blades were cleaned, no evidence of hard body impact damage was observed in the damaged areas of the three aforementioned blades. Nine additional axial compressor blades exhibited leading edge tip curling deformation in the direction opposite of rotation; the curling deformation was about .031 inches wide for all nine blades. Several of the blades exhibiting tip curls exhibited a slightly torn leading edge at the location of the deformation. Eight blades exhibited a bend at the tip end directly aft of the leading edge. One of the blades exhibited a circumferential rub mark on the tip end. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe axial compressor stator vane halves remained intact. All of the axial compressor stator vanes were in place and did not exhibit damage. The upper axial compressor stator vane half aft shroud rail had a 0.188 inch long section that was pushed rearward at about 1:30 o'clock. The lower axial stator vane half forward shroud rail had a 0.25 inch long section that was pushed rearward to the center rail at about 6:30 o'clock. The axial compressor stator vane halves did not have any apparent circumferential rub marks on the blade shroud. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe centrifugal compressor was intact. All of the centrifugal compressor blades had a 0.094 inch wide rub mark on the edges of the blades about 0.156 inches from the exducer end of the impeller. The centrifugal compressor impeller had a light coating of soot. The centrifugal impeller shroud was intact. The inner surface of the impeller shroud was sooted. The centrifugal impeller shroud did not have any visible circumferential rub marks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCombustion Section &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe combustion chamber liner was intact. The combustion chamber liner aft louver exhibited a white residue at about the 9 o'clock position. The combustion chamber liner did not exhibit evidence of sooting. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel manifold hoses between the fuel nozzles were all in place and their red insulation were partially burned away. There were no indications of leakage or thermal distress around the fuel manifold hoses as well as around the flow divider. The fuel nozzles were all in place. There was no sooting on the fuel nozzles or on the combustor dome around each of the nozzles. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe first stage nozzle assembly and curl were intact and did not exhibit evidence of thermal distress. All of the first stage nozzle airfoils were in place and did not exhibit evidence of damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe outer transition liner was intact and did not exhibit evidence of thermal distress. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTurbine Section&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rear bearing (Nos. 2 and 3) support housing outer case was intact but exhibited evidence of sooting. The rear bearing support housing outer case did not reveal signatures consistent with thermal distress or ruptures. The inner diameter forward edge of the de-swirl vanes contained two notches of broken away material, 0.375 and 0.438 inches long, at the 5 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions, respectively. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe gas producer (GP) turbine shroud was intact and did not exhibit evidence of damage. The GP turbine shroud had an intermittent circumferential rub mark that corresponded to the rub marks on some of the GP turbine blade tips. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe GP turbine disk remained intact. All of the GP turbine blades were in place in the disk and did not exhibit evidence of impact damage. Several of the GP turbine blades exhibited rub marks on the tips that corresponded to circumferential rub marks on the GP turbine shroud. Almost all of the GP turbine blades had a few, very small, silver-colored flakes on the suction side of the airfoil just aft of the leading edge. Three of the GP turbine blades were examined in a scanning electron microscope. Energy dispersive spectroscopy of about 15 of the silver-colored flakes determined that one was a stainless steel material, one was an impact mark with smeared metal from the drift that was used to push the blades out of the slots, and the remaining flakes were determined to be dirt.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe No. 2 bearing was intact, wet with oil, and could be rotated, although there was a slight roughness and resistance felt when the bearing was rotated. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PT nozzle assembly remained intact. All of the PT nozzle airfoils were in place and did not exhibit evidence of damage. The PT blade shroud did not exhibit evidence of circumferential rub marks. The PT shaft did not exhibit evidence of distortion, twisting, or rub marks. The PT disk and blades remained intact. The PT blades were sooted. The No. 3 bearing remained intact, wet with oil, and free to rotate. The bearing balls were in good condition.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccessory Gearbox Module &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe four nuts securing the engine accessory gearbox to the engine power section were tight. The accessory gearbox case was intact and the case cover was in place. Almost all of the case cover bolts were not tight. The accessory gearbox magnetic chip detector did not have any debris on the tip. The oil drained from the accessory gearbox was black, but did not exhibit an acrid smell. The breakaway torque of the PT thrust retention nut was measured in the loosening direction; the breakaway torque was in excess of 300 inch-pounds; the required installation torque for the PT thrust retention nut is 300 – 320 inch-pounds. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe starter-generator stub shaft was intact and the splines did not exhibit evidence of deformation. The forward drive shaft stub shaft spline was intact and the splines did not exhibit evidence of deformation. The rear drive shaft splines were intact and did not exhibit evidence of deformation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Controls and Accessories&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel control governor servo pressure (Py) was intact. The fuel pump mount flange bolts were not tight. The fuel pump housing was heavily sooted. The fuel pump drive shaft was intact and the splines were not deformed. The fuel pump drive shaft could be rotated by hand using a pair of pliers on the splines, but there was intermittent resistance as the driveshaft was turned. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel control was in place attached to the fuel pump. The fuel control-to-fuel pump flange could be flexed by hand. The fuel control housing had several fittings that were burned away at the threads. The fuel control housing was burned away at the acceleration bellows, exposing the bellows. The fuel control throttle lever was in the idle power position. The fuel control driveshaft was intact and the splines were not deformed. The fuel control driveshaft could be rotated by hand with some resistance. The fuel control driveshaft did not exhibit evidence of end play or looseness. The coupling between the fuel pump and fuel control was melted. The fuel control data plate was stamped 'SD'.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe head of the fuel filter bowl housing was partially burned away at the threads to the filter bowl and the threads to an adjacent fitting. The fuel filter bowl was intact along a 270° arc, but was enlarged with spider web-like cracks and distorted along a 90° arc. There was a pinhole in the filter bowl in the damaged part of the filter bowl. The fuel filter element remained intact and contained a few randomly located pieces of debris on the element. Both the fuel filter element and the inside of the filter bowl were sooted. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PT governor housing was partially burned and cracked open. All three of the PT governor mount flange bolts were not tight. The PT governor driveshaft could be rotated but exhibited some resistance. The screen in the PT governor housing had a flat, trapezoidal-shaped translucent object on the inside surface of the screen, but was otherwise free of debris. The flyweight spool bearing remained intact and was free to rotate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe PT overspeed controller box was burned and the wires were pulled out of both ends. The oil pump housing mount flange bolts were not tight. The oil pressure transducer housing was burned and sooted and its electrical cable was burned away at the fitting. The pneumatic inlet temperature (T1) compensator line between the T1 compensator and the fuel control was not tight at the T-fitting on the fuel control. The fuel line between the fuel filter housing and the fuel control was loose at the crimp on the fitting to the fuel control. The torque transducer housing was burned and the end was partially melted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFueling History&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator reported that the accident helicopter was last refueled at ValAir Aviation at PWA. ValAir Aviation is a fixed-base operator located on the east side of the airport. ValAir sells Phillips 66 fuel products and has a jet fuel storage facility consisting of two tanks, Nos. 3 and 4, which hold 10,000 and 6,000 gallons of fuel, respectively. According to ValAir, pipes from each tank are routed to one pump that services the refueling trucks. ValAir's records show that the fuel farm storage tanks and filters underwent daily checks and the inspection checklists for February 2013 show that there were no discrepancies recorded. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nValAir refueling records showed that on February 18, 2013, at 1415, N917EM was serviced with 36 gallons of Jet A fuel from Jet A truck No. 3. Truck No. 3 is a 3,000 gallon tank that has one single-point fueling nozzle and two overwing fueling nozzles. It was noted that the overwing fueling nozzles were black and the nozzle ends were rectangular in shape. The records showed that the accident helicopter was refueled from the forward overwing fueling nozzle. ValAir's records showed that truck No. 3 underwent daily, monthly, and quarterly inspections and checks, and no discrepancies were noted. Attachment 3 contains the inspection records for Jet A truck No. 3. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to ValAir's records, the last delivery of Jet A fuel prior to refueling the accident helicopter was on February 16, 2013, when they received 8,012 gallons each to tank Nos. 3 and 4. The Certificate of Analysis provided with the fuel delivery indicated the delivered fuel conformed to the American Society for Testing and Material (ASTM) Standard D1655 for jet fuel. According to ValAir, the jet fuel they sell is premixed with a fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII) at the fuel terminal before it is delivered to them. According to the fuel delivery ticket, 10 gallons of FSII was added to the 8,012 gallons of delivered fuel; this resulted in a dosage of about 0.12 percent. According to the specifications for FSII, the recommended dosage rate is 0.1% to 0.15 percent by volume. ValAir did not know the brand of FSII that was added to its fuel delivery. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 22, 2013, upon hearing about the accident, another ValAir customer, who had at least two other airplanes refueled from truck No. 3, contacted ValAir regarding concerns about the fuel. In response to that customer's concerns, ValAir tested the fuel for water and American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity. ValAir reported no evidence of water in the fuel and the API gravity was measured to be 43 at 38 degrees F; when corrected back to standard day temperature of 59 degrees F, the gravity was 44.9. The API gravity for jet fuel, either Jet A or Jet A-1, should be between 37.5 and 50.5. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEurocopter AS350B2 Engine Air Intake Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Air Intake Inspection Requirements &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Eurocopter AS350 B2 flight manual contains preflight checks in Section 4.1, titled \"Operating Procedures.\" These preflight checks are separated into five different stations around the helicopter, typically performed in sequential order. Station No. 2 states the engine air intake must be clear. The AS350 B2 flight manual also contains flight manual supplement SUP.4, titled \"Instructions for Operation in Cold Weather.\" In Paragraph 5 (\"Preparation for Flight\") of SUP.4, under \"Powerplant\", instructions are provided for removal of snow and ice accretion in the vicinity of the air intake, on either side of the screen, and to manually and visually check the air intake duct up to the first stage of the [engine] compressor for snow and ice. In Paragraph 9 (\"Check After Last Flight of the Day\") of SUP.4, it is recommended that the air intake cover and exhaust nozzle blank are installed. According to Eurocopter and Soloy, SUP.4 applies regardless of the engine model installed and the associated engine air inlet configuration. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSoloy Rotorcraft Flight Manual Supplement (RFMS) No. S2020H, dated January 3, 2012, contains preflight checks in Section 4.1, titled \"Operating Procedures.\" These preflight checks are similar to that of those listed in the AS350 B2 flight manual. Station No. 2 states the engine air intake must be clear, and in parentheses it lists water, snow, and foreign matter. According to Soloy, the AS350 B2 flight manual supplement SUP.4 would remain applicable on the actions to take during cold weather operation. According to the operator, both RFMS No. S2020H and SUP.4 were contained in the flight manual of the accident helicopter.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAS350B2 Original Engine Air Intake Design &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AS350B2 equipped with the Turbomeca Arriel engine has an air intake duct mounted to the forward end of the engine, adjacent to the first stage compressor. An air inlet screen is installed in a cutout on the top side of the engine cowling. The area of the air inlet screen is about the same size as the opening of the air intake duct. When the engine cowling is closed, a seal on the upper side of the air intake duct contacts the outer perimeter of the air inlet screen. The air intake duct remains continuous until the first stage compressor and contains a drain hole near the bottom of the duct to allow for drainage of water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAS350B2 (With Soloy STC SR01647SE) and AS350D Engine Air Intake Design &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AS350B2 equipped with the Honeywell LTS101 engine and the AS350 D has an air intake duct extension that is mounted to the top end of the upper air inlet scroll. A flat blanking plate is installed on the top side of the engine cowling to cover the original cutout for the Turbomeca Arriel engine air inlet screen. According to Soloy, the blanking plate for the AS350 D is a two-piece plate whereas the blanking plate for STC SR01647SE is a one-piece plate. An air inlet screen is installed, with about half of the air inlet screen overlapping the blanking plate and the other half covering the remainder of the engine cowling cutout. While the aft end of the engine cowling remains horizontally flat, the air inlet screen is angled slightly upward, resulting in an opening at the aft end of the air inlet screen which is left unprotected. This slope also results in a gap in the area where the air inlet screen and blanking plate overlap; moisture or debris could pass through the screen but remain in the gap between the air inlet screen and the blanking plate. By opening the engine cowling, portions of the overlapping area could be touched with a tactile inspection. The lower air inlet scroll contains a drain hole at the two lowest points of the scroll to allow for drainage of water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Ice Ingestion Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Ice Ingestion Requirements for the Honeywell LTS101-Series Engine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nType certificate data sheet (TCDS) No. E5NE (Revision 20 dated October 24, 2011) for the Honeywell LTS101 engine states that the engine had not been tested to evaluate the effects of bird and ice ball ingestion (reference Note 11 of the TCDS). The TCDS further states that \"the bird and ice ball ingestion characteristics of the airframe air inlet and engine combinations are to be evaluated prior to approval of the engine installation.\" According to Honeywell, at the time of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certification, the LTS101-700D-2 engine met the requirements of 14 CFR Part 33.77 (Foreign object ingestion – ice) via similarity to the LTS101-600A-3A engine. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Ice Ingestion Requirements for the Turbomeca Arriel-Series Engine &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTCDS No. E00054EN (Revision 8 dated July 15, 2011) for the Turbomeca Arriel engine states that the engines had not been tested to evaluate the effects of foreign object ingestion other than rain water (reference Note 6 of the TCDS). The TCDS further states that \"the helicopter air intake design shall be such to prevent instantaneous ingestion of ice, snow, and water in excess of maximum quantities defined in the Installation and Operating Manual. A protective grid, as defined in the Installation and Operation Manual shall be installed to limit the ingestion of foreign matter in the engine.\" Attachment 9 contains TCDS No. E00054EN&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Ice Ingestion Requirements for the Eurocopter AS350-Series Helicopter &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTCDS No. H9EU (Revision 21 dated September 12, 2012) for the Eurocopter AS350-series helicopter states that for compliance with applicable powerplant ice protection requirements, the helicopter must be equipped during all operations with engine air inlet conforming to Eurocopter drawing number 350A58-1608 for aircraft fitted with Lycoming engines (reference Note 4 of the TCDS). According to Eurocopter, drawing number 350A58-1608 is for the air inlet screen for the LTS101 engine installation. According to Soloy, because the design of the air intake system for STC SR01647SE is virtually identical to that of the AS350 D, additional testing for ice ingestion limits was not performed and the STC was approved by the FAA without testing and via similarity. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was flying a helicopter as part of a Department of Interior (DOI) reseeding project when the helicopter struck the static line above a set of power transmission lines. Postaccident examination of the engine and airframe revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The length and direction of the debris field was consistent with the helicopter traveling in the direction of, and at a rate of speed consistent with, a seed dispersal run.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was familiar with the area and was aware of the transmission lines, having performed a reconnaissance flight and flown over them multiple times during the previous flights that day. In the area of the accident site, the power lines began an ascent up an adjacent hill, with the static lines diverging such that they were about 40 feet higher than the power lines at the collision location. The static lines were of thinner gauge and could easily have been obscured by the surrounding hilly terrain. The lines were depicted on the relevant Federal Aviation Administration sectional chart. The helicopter was not equipped with a wire strike protection system nor was it required to be under the terms of the DOI contract. Neither the power nor static lines were equipped with visibility markers nor were they required to be due to their elevation above ground level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had flown 40.5 hours over the last 5 days as part of the reseeding project, which was just short of the DOI contract maximum. A review his sleep history indicated that he received adequate rest the night before the accident. On the morning of the accident, he had flown 10 application runs in an area about 70 miles away. He took a lunch break about 3 hours before the accident, then flew 20 separate seed application runs and 10 reloads. His total flight time for that day was 6.6 hours. The low-level and \"nap of the earth\" flight operations required considerable concentration, most likely resulting in task-and/or work-related fatigue at the end of the day. By comparison, the United States Army recommends a maximum flight time of 8 hours per day or 37 hours per week, with a reduction of a factor of 1.3 to 1.6 for low-level and \"nap of the earth\" flying; thus the pilot would have exceeded their duty hour recommendations for each of the 5 days leading up to and including the accident day.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held an assisted special issuance second-class medical certificate based on a reported history of diabetes for which he was taking medication. His most recent medical examination revealed a new diagnosis for hypertension, as well as preexisting cataracts in both eyes, which exhibited no change since his last examination a year prior. In part due to the lack of an autopsy, the relevance of these findings, combined with his likely work-related fatigue, could not be determined.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Pilot Itinerary&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot began the seeding mission on the morning of February 13, when he departed from his home airport in Elko, Nevada, in the accident helicopter. For the next 4 days, he accumulated about 8 hours of flight per day, totaling 33.9 hours. On the day of the accident he accumulated 6.6 hours of flight time, and as such his 5-day total for the period leading up to the accident was 40.5 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the pilot's flight history for the prior 2 months revealed 6-day flight time totals of between 8 and 28.4 flight hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter fuel truck driver had been working with the pilot all week for the seeding operations. They had shared a hotel room each evening in order to reduce expenses. On the night prior to the accident, the pilot went to bed at 2030 and awoke at 0530. He was not aware of the pilot waking up or having sleeping problems during the night. He stated that he had shared rooms with the pilot on prior missions and that nothing about that evening stood out as unusual.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot Fatigue Issues&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWith regards to the effect of time-on-task as a cause of fatigue and an influence on performance among helicopter pilots, one such study (A.M. Stave, \"The Effects of Cockpit Environment on Long-Term Pilot Performance,\" Human Factors, Vol. 19 (1977)), examined the effect of a helicopter cockpit environment and continuous flying activity on subjective fatigue and pilot performance. For this study, flight legs were designed to simulate repetitive circular, helicopter air taxi flights conducted under instrument flight rules in a metropolitan area, with complete circuits lasting about 1 hour and including three approaches and landings. Pilots flew for flight periods varying between 3 and 8 hours, with rest breaks permitted during the 4- and 8-hour flight periods. Pilot performance was measured, and the pilots also provided ratings of subjective fatigue each hour.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTime-on-task and subjective fatigue were found to have no effect on some basic aspects of flying performance, but they were associated with increased \"lapses\" in performance, such as navigational errors. The study found that subjective fatigue increased with time-on-task, peaking during the last hour of flight, but scheduled breaks delayed the onset of subjective fatigue.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight Time and Duty Period Limitations&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe DOI contract specified limits for the pilot, which capped flight time during any assigned duty period to 8 hours. Thirty-six or more flight hours in a consecutive 6-day period required the next calendar day off duty, with a maximum of 42 hours in any consecutive 6-day period. These flight limitations exceeded those required under the rules pertaining to agricultural aircraft operations, governed under Federal Air Regulations part 137, which do not set specific flight time limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBy comparison, United States Army flight regulations (Headquarters Department of the Army, Aviation Flight Regulations, U.S. Army Regulation 95-1(Washington, DC: HQDA, 1997)) allow local commanders flexibility in developing flight time limitations for helicopter pilots, but they recommend that flight time be limited to 8 hours per 24-hour period, 15 hours per 48-hour period, and 37 hours per week. Army regulations also recommend that maximum helicopter pilot flight times be reduced by factors of 1.3 for day contour or low-level flight and 1.6 for day, \"nap of the earth\" flight. These recommendations were developed based on data which indicated that low-altitude flight profiles following terrain contours and lower-altitude, terrain-hugging flights were more fatiguing for pilots than higher-altitude flights.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPower Transmission Lines&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the power company, the base of the transmission tower to the east of the accident site was at an elevation of 6,557 feet, with the west tower at 6,870 feet. The power cables were attached to the towers about 45 feet above the ground, with the static lines a further 20 feet higher. The towers were separated by a distance of about 1,800 feet, and the power cables sagged about 40 feet below the static lines at the center point. Neither the power nor static lines were equipped with visibility markers; their height above the ground did not require the use of such markers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located within the area covered by the FAA Las Vegas Sectional Aeronautical Chart, and the power transmission lines were depicted on the chart in the vicinity of the accident site. - The helicopter was manufactured in 1981 and equipped with a Rolls-Royce/Allison 250-C20B gas turbine engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the maintenance logbooks revealed that the last inspection was for a 100-hour engine and airframe exam dated February 8, 2013. At that time the airframe had accumulated a total flight time of 15,540 hours, with the engine accruing 1,492.8 hours since major overhaul.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a seed spreading system, the operation of which was controlled by the pilot in conjunction with the onboard agricultural navigation system. The seeder consisted of a bucket and dispersal mechanism, and was attached to the helicopter's belly hook. The lowest portion of the seeder was about 11 feet below the skids. The helicopter was not equipped with a wire strike protection system, nor was it required to be under the terms of the DOI contract. - On February 18, 2013, at 1424 Pacific standard time, a Bell 206B helicopter, N20620, collided with power transmission lines near Eureka, Nevada. El Aero Services, Inc., owned the helicopter, which was being operated by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), as a public-use seed-dispersal flight. The commercial pilot sustained fatal injuries; the helicopter was substantially damaged during the accident sequence. The flight departed about 1420 from a temporary loading area 2 miles east of the accident site. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was utilized for a low-level (100-200 feet above ground level) aerial reseeding project for the area damaged by the \"Pinto Fire,\" which occurred in June 2012, just east of Eureka. The land was managed by the BLM, and the services of El Aero were retained for the DOI utilizing an \"On Call\" contract.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 0700 on the morning of the accident, the pilot departed in the helicopter from Ely Airport (Yelland Field), Ely, Nevada. He proceeded 40 miles south-southwest to a helispot south of Lund, at the base of Ninemile Mountain. Over the course of the next 2 hours he performed about 10 separate seed application runs utilizing a seeder attached to the bottom of the helicopter, returning to the helispot to reload each time. At 0947, he departed for a second helispot 70 miles northwest in the Pinto Creek Ranch area, along the eastern foothills of the Diamond Mountains range. From there he flew a reconnaissance mission along the intended drop zone with the BLM Helicopter Manager. The manager stated that during the flight he made the pilot aware of two separate sets of power transmission lines in and around the seeding area. The pilot had experience flying in that area before, and informed the manager that there was in fact a third set of power lines in the seeding area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot then performed multiple uneventful seed-dispersal runs throughout the morning. The operation continued after lunch, however, after departing for the last drop of the day, he did not return. A search was initiated, and at 1500 the helicopter wreckage was located. - The White Pine County Sheriff/Coroner completed an external examination and indicated the cause of death as massive head trauma. Subsequently, the pilot's remains were released to the local funeral home, where the Elko County Coroner assisted with recovering blood/tissue samples for toxicology.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological tests on the recovered specimens were performed by the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI). Analysis revealed negative findings for carbon monoxide. The results were positive for Pioglitazone, which was detected in the Blood and Liver, and negative for all remaining screened drug substances and ingested alcohol. Refer to the toxicology report included in the public docket for specific test parameters and results.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to CAMI, Pioglitazone is a prescription drug of the class thiazolidinedione with hypoglycemic (antihyperglycemic, antidiabetic) action, used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pilot reported the use of both Pioglitazone (Actos), and the following medications on his most recent application for a medical certificate: Metformin (Glucophage XR), Glimepiride (Amaryl), Aspirin, Simvastatin (Zocor), Losartan (Cozaar).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was issued the AASI medical certificate based on a reported history of diabetes mellitus for which he was taking medication. His most recent medical examination revealed a new diagnosis for hypertension, as well as preexisting cataracts in both eyes, which exhibited no change since his last examination in April 2011. - An automated surface weather observation at Eureka Airport (elevation 5,958 feet msl, 12 miles northwest of the accident site) was issued at 1415. It indicated calm wind; clear skies, with visibilities of 10 miles; temperature of 7 degrees C; dew point -8 degrees C; and an altimeter setting at 29.91 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the U.S. Naval Observatory, Astronomical Applications Department, the altitude of the Sun when viewed from Ely at 1425 would have been 28.4 degrees, with an Azimuth (E of N) of 223.2 degrees. - The 74-year-old pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single and multi-engine land, rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument airplane. He additionally held a flight instructor rating for airplane single and multi-engine, and rotorcraft-helicopter, as well as an airframe and powerplant mechanic certificate with inspection authorization. Due to a history of diabetes he held an aviation medical examiner assisted special issuance (AASI) second-class medical certificate issued in April 2012, with limitations that he must wear lenses for near and distant vision. At the time of application for the medical certificate, he reported a total flight experience of 37,500 flight hours. His most recent airman competency/proficiency check was performed on April 26, 2012.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was involved in another helicopter accident, which occurred while herding horses on October 18, 2007, in Medora, North Dakota. The NTSB determined the probable cause of the accident as, \"The pilot failed to maintain clearance from the fence while maneuvering at a low altitude\". See NTSB accident number CHI08CA021 for further details. - Navigation Systems&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an Automated Flight Following System (AFF), an Ag-Nav GPS based agricultural navigation system, and a Garmin GPSMap 496 GPS receiver.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AFF system transmitted positional reports without altitude information to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service data center at roughly 2-minute intervals; the last recorded position occurred at the accident site at 14:23:38. The Garmin unit did not contain any data for the accident flight, and was most likely off at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Ag-Nav system was utilized by the pilot to disperse seed, and was configured to record its position every 0.6 seconds. In addition, the unit was capable of recording heading, altitude, and \"spray\" status. The unit sustained impact damage, and was sent to the National Transportation Safety Board Office of Research and Engineering for examination, and then to Ag-Nav in Ontario, Canada, for data extraction. The data corroborated the AFF information, albeit at a higher resolution.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe data revealed that the helicopter had administered seeds in the area over the course of 20 separate passes prior to the accident. Each pass was oriented north-south, about 1 mile long and 80 feet apart, with the helicopter typically returning to be reloaded after every 2 passes. The power transmission lines and two of their associated towers transected the area, with the helicopter flying over the lines on every pass. Throughout the passes, the helicopter maintained a ground clearance of between 100 and 200 feet agl. The last recorded position was located about 2,000 feet south of the main rotor blades and power lines, at the southern boundary of the application area. At that time the helicopter was climbing from 6,634 to 6,696 feet, and transitioning from the pass heading of 162 degrees true, to 172 degrees. The unit recorded that the spray system was set to off just prior to the helicopter reaching the southern boundary. The final position reports and spray status followed a similar profile to the other passes, and were consistent with the pilot initiating a climbing right turn for an application run.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe impact sequence was not recorded. According to representatives from Ag-Nav, the unit contains a 10-second memory buffer, and as such will not record the last 10 seconds of data if electrical power is unexpectedly interrupted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHelicopter Exam&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine sustained minimal damage during the accident sequence, and remained attached to its airframe mounts. All engine controls remained attached, and all fuel, pneumatic, and hydraulic lines remained firmly in place at their fittings. The stage 4 turbine wheel appeared intact, and there were no indications of oil leaks or catastrophic engine failure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rotor mast remained attached to the airframe, and was canted about 45 degrees aft along with the main rotor gearbox. The collective and cyclic control linkages had sustained varying degrees of impact damage from the main rotor gearbox through to the head; both were bent at and separated from their respective fittings. Examination of the main rotor head revealed that it had separated from the mast just below the droop stops. The mast exhibited bending damage to both sides in the immediate vicinity of the break.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTail rotor drive train continuity was established from the main gearbox through to both tail rotor blades, with the drive shaft separating from the main gearbox at the output coupling. The tail rotor pitch control tube had been cut at the bulkhead by recovery personnel, and remained continuous through to the tail rotor pitch links. - The general area of the accident site was snow covered, and comprised of rolling hills intermittently dispersed with burnt trees. The terrain immediately to the west rose to a peak about 300 feet above the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe entire helicopter, with the exception of the main rotor blades, was located about 475 feet north of a set of power transmission lines, at an elevation of about 6,700 feet mean sea level (msl). The lines traversed from east to west, climbing about 300 feet with the terrain. The lines consisted of three sets of horizontally positioned tandem power cables. Above the power cables were two thinner-gauge static lines; the southern static line was severed, and was found draped over the power cables. The seeder was half full with seeds, and was located about 10 feet from the helicopter. The intermediate area was covered with a layer of seeds. Both main rotor blades remained attached to the mast head, and had come to rest to the south, midway between the power lines and helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter sustained crush damage from the nose through to the aft bulkhead, and the tailboom was severed just forward of the horizontal stabilizer. The outboard sections of both main rotor blades exhibited serrated gouges, with upper and lower skin striations consistent in appearance with the severed static line. Similar patterns were present on the main rotor mast. The seeder exhibited a similar gouge in its upper skin, with horizontal scratches and black sooting on the forward surface of its bucket, about 5 feet below the helicopter skids. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "***This report was modified on October 1, 2015. Please see the docket for this accident to view the original report.**&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was hired to fly the helicopter for the production of a reality television show. The tentative plan scripted for the production shoot called for an actor to drop a backpack to the ground while the helicopter was in a hover to enable the cameras to film the airborne actor, the backpack receiver on the ground, and the helicopter executing the mission. Two shots were needed of the backpack being dropped, and they were to be done by two different actors at two separate locations at a movie ranch; the accident occurred during the filming of the second shot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecovered audio and video recordings from inside the helicopter revealed that the first bag-drop flight occurred around 2100, lasted about an hour, and consisted of four actual bag drops. During the first flight, the pilot made numerous comments about not being able to see the drop zone due to the dark night conditions and had the actor guide him with verbalized visual cues to ensure that the helicopter remained clear of trees. Several of the pilot's comments indicate that he was trying to be amenable to the production company's requests, and, although he did not directly communicate that he could not comply with some of them, he repeatedly remarked on the limited visibility and the brightness of a flexible light pad affixed to the center windshield frame in the cockpit. After the flight, he expressed his appreciation to the ground crew for not pressuring him and giving him the opportunity to perform multiple passes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe second bag-drop location was on a plateau close to the landing zone and was situated about 85 ft above a dry riverbed. The plan was for the helicopter to maneuver toward the plateau while ascending from the riverbed. There were no lights in the river valley; however, the production crew had placed lights on the plateau and glowsticks and another light on the sloping terrain leading up from the riverbed to the top of the plateau. The flight began around 0330 and was conducted with the pilot in the right-front seat, the actor in the left-front seat, and the camera operator in the left-rear seat. The flexible light pad was cupped to direct the light toward the actor's face.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBefore takeoff, the camera operator asked the pilot if they could try to use the light pad, and the pilot responded, \"we'll see, it just really [sigh] blinds me.\" The camera operator then showed the actor how to operate the light pad. The actor turned it on to the lowest setting, and the camera operator remarked that it was bright but that they would see what the pilot thought; the pilot did not comment. During the initial takeoff and while maneuvering over the dry riverbed, the actor continued with scripted dialogue for about a minute until the pilot intervened to state that he needed the light pad turned off. The camera operator acknowledged him and informed the actor to turn off the light by pressing a button twice. The actor leaned forward to turn off the light, and, 8 seconds later, the camera operator announced, \"where did uh, we're going down low,\" indicating that he was temporarily disoriented and then noted that they were descending. The actor cycled through the light's settings and eventually turned it off while the pilot simultaneously stated, \"okay, okay, I can't.\" The camera operator interrupted saying, \"pull up, pull up.\" The helicopter subsequently impacted terrain in the dry riverbed. Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot recognized on the first flight that he was operating with reduced/no visibility and with a bright light in the cockpit that \"blinded\" him when it was on but chose to proceed with both flights likely because he believed that was what was required to fulfill the production requirements. Despite recognizing the hazards of the operation and relaying his concerns to the ground crew and camera operator, the pilot was the only person knowledgeable about helicopters. As the pilot, he was responsible for the safe operation of the helicopter and should have initiated the measures necessary to ensure that the helicopter's internal lighting and the lighting on the ground would enable him to conduct the flight in a safe manner. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident occurred during the hours of darkness on a moonless night over minimally lighted terrain. According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidance, these conditions can result in illusions that make it difficult for a pilot to visually determine altitude, depth perception, and orientation, and often create the illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is. Additionally temporary blindness, caused by an unusually bright light, may result in illusions or after images until the eyes recover from the brightness. Based on the dark night conditions, the minimal ground lighting, the bright light in the cockpit, and the absence of preimpact mechanical anomalies, the pilot was likely temporarily blinded by the light, lost visual reference to the ground, and then flew the helicopter into the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBefore the accident flight, the company submitted, and an FAA inspector subsequently accepted, a proposed Motion Picture Plan of Activities. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 10, 2013, about 0330 Pacific standard time, a Bell Helicopter 206B JetRanger, N59518, collided with terrain shortly after departing from a landing zone (LZ) on a movie ranch near Acton, California. Orbic Air, LLC was operating the helicopter under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The commercial pilot and two passengers (an actor and a camera-operator) sustained fatal injuries; the helicopter sustained substantial damage. The local flight departed the LZ about one minute prior to the accident for the purpose of shooting an aerial video sequence. Dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was being used for the filming of a reality television show. The pilot and several members of the production crew had scouted the movie ranch location a few weeks prior, at which time they discussed the helicopter's maneuver possibilities, equipment needed, and filming planning. Following that meeting, the pilot filed a Plan of Action (POA) waiver with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the filming day was scheduled for the evening of February 9th.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tentative plan scripted for the production shoot called for an actor to drop a backpack to the ground while the helicopter was in a hover, enabling the cameras to film the airborne actor, the backpack receiver on the ground, and the helicopter executing the mission. There were two shots needed of the backpack being dropped, to be done by two different actors, at two separate locations, both of which were at the movie ranch.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot departed on February 9 about 1645 from the helicopter's base at Van Nuys Airport, Van Nuys, California, with about 55 gallons of fuel onboard and an additional 10 gallons of fuel in plastic containers. The helicopter arrived at the LZ, and about 1730, the pilot conducted a safety meeting with the production crewmembers, briefing them of the potential hazards of having the helicopter on-site. The pilot unloaded the fuel containers and removed the left-side doors.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA Canon EOS 300PL video camera was used by the rear-seated camera operator on both a prior flight and the accident flight, as was a Sounds Devices 702T audio recorder. A GoPro Hero camera was installed on the upper windshield frame to film the actor on the accident flight. Additionally, a 3-mode FLEXiT flexible light pad was affixed to the center windshield frame with a grip clip and cupped to direct the light toward the actor's face for the purpose of the GoPro recording. The actor and camera-operator additionally had headlights with red and white light settings and there was a dim white map light installed on the helicopter between the actor and pilot on the bulkhead. NTSB investigators recovered audio and video recordings from these devices at the accident site, and a recorder specialist with the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Division downloaded and synced the files together and created a partial transcript that is contained within the Recorder Specialist's factual report available in the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrior Flight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe first flight began around 2100 and was conducted with the pilot in the right-front seat, the actor in the left-front seat, and the camera operator in the left-rear seat. The flight's duration was about an hour and consisted of the pilot performing four bag drops over a predetermined drop zone (an open clearing surrounded by trees) located a few hundred yards away from the LZ. While the helicopter made a pass over the drop zone, the actor would drop the backpack, and then they would return to the LZ to retrieve the backpack and discuss the necessary changes in the flight to capture the correct shot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPrior to departure, while the pilot was waiting for the engine to warm up, a conversation ensued between the pilot, actor, and camera operator about the lighting being used inside the helicopter. The camera operator stated that he wanted to ensure the pilot was comfortable with the FLEXiT light and instructed the actor to turn it on by clicking it 3 times. Upon the light coming on, the pilot responded \"whoa, that is, that did change a bit.\" The camera operator then instructed the actor to \"click it down, uh, once.\" The pilot stated \"okay that's better,\" followed by making a request to the actor to move the light a certain way the actor confirmed. The camera operator added \"you know we can turn it off once we're airborne.\" The pilot did not make a verbal acknowledgement and began talking to the ground crew. The camera operator interjected to the actor about turning his headlight off. The camera operator then asked the pilot if the actor should turn his headlight off to which the pilot said yes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter departed and was en route to the drop zone when the pilot established communication with the ground crew again. He interrupted his communication and stated \"okay, I gotta lose that light for right now guys,\" and \"I can't see.\" About 10 seconds later, he told the actor that his headlight had to be turned off. Several seconds later the pilot communicated with the ground crew that they were \"getting acclimated to the light here.\" As they neared the drop zone the actor asked, \"want me to turn the light back on or we just staying with it off?\" The pilot then told the actor that he would have to spot him because he was unable to see, which the actor acknowledged. After the bag drop, they returned to the LZ.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGround crew radioed the pilot to ask if it was possible for him to slow the helicopter down more over the drop zone. The pilot responded that he would do that and was \"just getting acclimated\" and could not \"see anything and especially the ground that's underneath me.\" A little later, the ground crew stated \"just to be clear, I know that you are having site issues, but the goal is a slow hover and then a drop from there,\" which the pilot acknowledged. The ground crew later asked if the pilot was able to see the glow sticks on the ground, and the actor told the pilot that he was able to see the glow sticks. The pilot then told the ground crew that the actor was able to see the glow sticks and said \"I can't see anything, so he's got to walk me through.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the second bag-drop attempt, the pilot had to perform a go around stating that, \"I can't uhh see where the ground is here.\" On the next attempt, the actor guided the pilot by giving visual cues near the bag drop zone for about 3 minutes until the bag drop occurred. About 15 seconds after, the ground crew asked, \"is it possible to do an even slower hover than that?\" The pilot responded by saying \"yeah it's just uh, there's, I have to have a visual cue to see something around me.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhile en route back to the LZ, the pilot asked the ground crew if they could arrange with the vehicles located near the drop zone to turn their headlights on so he could have a sense of depth perception and would be able to see a little better. They briefly discussed how the bag drop went, and the pilot again said that if the headlights on the vehicles were illuminated then \"I can see the ground and then I can judge my speed… I have no rate of speed up here.\" A few minutes later, after discussing the next drop briefly, the actor commented that he didn't have enough time to release the bag and told the pilot \"to make sure it doesn't keep moving forward...\" The pilot responded saying that would be difficult because there was \"no depth perception… you can't see anything.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOver the next eight minutes, there were requests from the ground crew and actor for the pilot to hold a hover to which the pilot replied that the helicopter was not capable of the hover they desired and that \"the key to the hover is being able to see something.\" The third bag drop was accomplished and again there was discussion about the next drop with regard to the actor and ground crew requesting a low hover or for the pilot to reverse the helicopter. The pilot said that would be difficult for him to perform without better visual cues and continued with him mentioning the safety risks of hovering backwards, concluding with \"I can't see enough to hold the hover.\" The fourth bag drop was conducted with the actor guiding the pilot with verbalized visual cues near the drop zone and then they returned back to the LZ. The pilot queried the camera operator about the footage obtained and emphasized that safety is a priority. The pilot relayed his appreciation to the ground crew of not being pushed when flying at night, in an out-of-ground effect hover, with no visual cues. He added that it was \"just the nature of the show\" and that this is why he needed to do a couple of passes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe production crew and pilot had a catered meal break at 2300, and the pilot rested in a trailer for about 1.5-2 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccident Flight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe next filming location was about 1,500 feet southeast of the LZ on a plateau located east of a north-south oriented valley. A dirt road ran along the plateau's edge (which was also the valley's eastern ridgeline), and the terrain west of the road sloped down about 85 feet to another dirt road. The terrain continued to gradually slope down from that road into the valley and dry riverbed that stretched about 1,000 feet to the west. There were no lights in the valley.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter his rest, the pilot went to the plateau to view the lighting situation and discuss with the director and other production crewmembers the second, and final, backpack-dropping mission. The helicopter was to hover at the west side of the valley and then maneuver east toward the plateau. The helicopter would then ascend from below the ridgeline with its left side in view for the actor to be filmed dropping the bag onto the plateau. There were two cranes set up with light directed toward the area of the plateau where the bag was to be dropped. The pilot requested that another smaller light be erected to illuminate the sloping terrain just below the dirt road (illuminating the ridgeline). He additionally requested that glow-sticks be placed in line on the slope to lead up to the drop zone. Both of the lighting requests were granted, and the director and pilot agreed on the scene and maneuvers to be performed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter removing frost from the main rotor blades and windshield, the pilot departed the LZ about 0330 with a different actor in the left-front seat and the same camera operator in the left-rear seat. Witnesses observed the helicopter depart normally and fly toward the plateau from the west. According to some of the witnesses while the helicopter was maneuvering about 60 miles per hour, it pitched down and collided with the terrain below the ridgeline.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe GoPro recording started with the actor and camera operator settling into the helicopter. A little over a minute thereafter the pilot is heard telling the actor that he may need to turn off his headlight. The actor inquired if he could keep it on the red light to which the pilot responded that would be fine but \"I just can't have you looking at me.\" The camera operator then asked the pilot \"do you think we can try one click on the LED lights?\" The pilot responded, \"we'll see, it just really [sigh] blinds me.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe camera operator then began to speak to the actor and verbally instructed him on how to operate the FLEXiT light. The actor clicked the button, and the cockpit area illuminated. The camera operator remarked \"that's two LEDs…that's pretty bright\" and then remarked that they will see what the pilot says. As the pilot started the engine, the camera operator further clarified to the actor that two more clicks of the button would turn the light off. About seven minutes into the GoPro recording, the Canon recording began, providing a view of the cockpit from the camera operator's perspective. The FLEXiT light had 2 of its 16 LED lights illuminated (indicating it was in its lowest intensity position) and was folded toward the actor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring takeoff from the LZ, the actor continued the scripted dialogue for about a minute until the pilot intervened saying, \"I need to lose this light, this key light here.\" The camera operator acknowledged him and informed the actor to click the button twice to turn the light off. The actor reached forward to turn off the light. Eight seconds later the camera operator said \"where did uh, we're going down low.\" The cockpit illuminated brighter twice and then went dark, an indication that the actor had turned off the light (over 12 seconds after the pilot's request). Simultaneously, the pilot responded \"okay, okay, I can't…\" and the camera operator interrupted saying \"pull up, pull up.\" The helicopter impacted terrain 1 minute and 17 seconds after takeoff.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 59, held a commercial pilot certificate issued in January 2006 with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopters and single and multi-engine land airplanes with an instrument rating (airplane). He additionally held a flight instructor certificate with ratings for rotorcraft-helicopters and instrument. He held a second-class airman medical certificate issued in March 2012, with no limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's personal flight records were not recovered. On his last application for a medical certificate, he reported a total flight time of 19,605 hours, of which 220 hours were accumulated in the last six months. In 2012, the pilot had flown 11 flights (equating to 37.7 hours) with Orbic Air, LLC, of which 7 were conducted in the accident helicopter for the purpose of aerial production.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA records, the pilot was involved in two prior helicopter accidents. The first accident, LAX03LA027, was in 2002, and the NTSB determined that it was the result of the pilot's inadequate visual lookout and failure to maintain adequate clearance from transmission wires while operating a helicopter for a television production. The second accident, LAX04LA216, was in 2004, and the NTSB determined that the pilot landed hard during a filming operation following a momentary loss of engine power for undetermined reasons.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn response to the 2002 accident, the FAA suspended the pilot's license for 30 days in December 2003 for operating a helicopter in a \"careless and reckless manner.\" In 2007, the FAA took further enforcement action against the pilot, and his certificate was suspended for 45 days for \"failing to remain in two-way-radio communication with air traffic controllers while flying in airspace in which two-way radio communication is required.''&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the FAA database revealed that neither the actor nor the camera operator held a pilot's certificate, and there was no information found to indicate that they had any knowledge of helicopter operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Bell Helicopter 206B2 JetRanger, serial number (s/n) 1322, was manufactured in 1974. A review of the logbooks revealed that the most recent 100-hour inspection of the airframe and engine was performed on January 24, 2013, at an airframe total time of 7,435.9 hours, equating to 6.3 hours prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe powerplant, an Allison 250-C20B, s/n CAE831376, was last overhauled in March 1990, equating to 833.9 operational hours before the accident. The helicopter's flight log was located in the wreckage. Those records indicated that the last time the helicopter was flown was 6 days prior to the accident where another pilot flew for 3.4 hours and did not report any squawks. On the log, the pilot had marked down the Hobbs meter time when departing from Van Nuys, indicating that he had flown the helicopter for 1.5 hours prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOperation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was owned and registered to Van Nuys Copters, LLC and being operated by Orbic Air, LLC. Eyeworks USA, LLC, also doing business as Bongo, LLC, was the production company that had contracted Orbic Air to provide helicopter services for a reality television show they were producing. The pilot was operating under the movie manual of Crossbow Helicopters, a company that he owned. The pilot was listed in the insurance contract as being employed by Orbic Air, LLC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA routine aviation weather report generated by an Automated Surface Observation System at the airport indicated that about 5 minutes prior to the accident, the conditions were as follows: wind was from 260 degrees at 9 knots; temperature 66 degrees Fahrenheit; dew point 28 degrees Fahrenheit; and altimeter 29.60 inHg.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident occurred during the hours of darkness. Data from the United States Naval Observatory indicated that the phase of the moon was waxing crescent with 1-percent of the Moon's visible disk illuminated. The sunset occurred at 1732, and the end of civil twilight was at 1758. According to the United States Naval Observatory astronomical data, at the time of the accident, the moon was below the horizon with a new moon occurring a few hours before.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located on a movie ranch, with the debris stretching over 110 feet from the first impact marking (toe of left skid) to the farthest debris found (portion of the tail rotor); the main wreckage was situated near the end of the debris path. The surrounding area was comprised of dirt and brush typical of the Southern California desert. The global positioning satellite (GPS) coordinates for the main wreckage were approximately 34 degrees 25 minutes 56 seconds north latitude and 118 degrees 14 minutes 36 seconds west longitude, at an elevation of about 2,415 feet mean sea level (msl).  All pieces of the helicopter were found at the wreckage site with the exception of the two doors, which had been removed before the flight for the purpose of filming. A complete pictorial of the wreckage location and surrounding terrain is contained in the public docket for this accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage came to rest at the base of a plateau in a valley that contained dry creek beds and dirt roads. The LZ was about 1,500 ft from the accident site on a heading of about 340 degrees. The production crew that was filming was positioned on the plateau between the accident site and the LZ. The location where the bag was to be dropped was located upslope from the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Los Angeles County Coroner completed an autopsy of the pilot. The FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI) performed toxicological screenings on specimens of the pilot. Analysis of the specimens contained no findings for carbon monoxide, cyanide, volatiles, and tested drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing recovery, the wreckage was examined at a storage facility and the engine and fuel control unit (FCU) were sent to their respective manufacturers for teardown examinations. Investigators accounted for all major airframe components at the accident site with the exception of the two doors removed prior to the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMultiple main rotor control tube and pitch link fractures were observed, and all appeared to be consistent with overload. Both cyclic servos and the collective servo were observed in the cylinder support; the mounts for the servos were fractured. Manipulation of the swashplate inner ring (non-rotating swashplate) resulted in a corresponding movement of the cyclic control tubes and respective bellcranks. When the collective lever on the support assembly was manipulated, movement of the collective control tube and bellcrank were observed. The main rotor mast was fractured slightly below the main rotor hub assembly. One main rotor blade was fractured in two places; the other exhibited multiple fractures. The freewheeling unit was removed, and no anomalies were found.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the tail rotor drive system revealed that the drive shaft fractures were consistent with overload. The tail rotor gear box chip detector contained no visible particulate matter. The tail rotor rotated freely in both directions when spun by hand, and corresponding rotation of the tail rotor gear box input shaft was observed. Oil was visibly present in the tail rotor gear box and on the lower portion of the vertical fin. One of the tail rotor blades was bent about 45 degrees and fractured in a manner consistent with overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe three main transmission chip detectors were removed, and no visible particulate matter was observed. The transmission filter element was removed, and no visible particulate matter was observed. The engine-to-transmission drive shaft was intact, and the dots on the temperature dot strip appeared white.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe N2 drive train was free and continuous from the 4th stage turbine wheel to the power takeoff gear during manual rotation. The N1 drive train could be rotated by hand and was continuous to the starter generator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe gas producer and power turbine were disassembled down to the rotors. The 1st stage turbine nozzle and nozzle shield displayed metallic spatter across the nozzle shield face and nozzle surfaces. The 1st stage nozzle was otherwise undamaged. Ingestion of small metallic debris was noted throughout the gas path consistent with the engine operating at the time of impact. All four turbine wheels were otherwise undamaged. The 4th stage turbine nozzle, which contains the blade tracks for the 3rd and 4th stage turbine wheels, revealed signs of heavy rub on both the 3rd and 4th stage blade tracks. The 4th stage nozzle also had a crack and was sent to the Rolls-Royce Metallurgy lab for examination and documentation. According to the lab's report, heavy oxidation on the surface of the fracture indicated that it was not related to or as a result of the impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accessory gearbox was undamaged and normal in appearance. The upper and lower chip detectors were removed and visually examined. Both chip detectors contained a small amount of metallic debris, which according to a Rolls-Royce representative, was consistent with normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators conducted examinations of the FCU and power turbine governor at Honeywell, the manufacturer.  A functional test and complete disassembly of the FCU disclosed that there were no anomalies that would have prevented the unit from functioning normally. Disassembly of the impact-damaged power turbine governor revealed that there was no evidence of pre impact mechanical malfunctions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPost accident examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCertificate of Waiver for Motion Picture and Television&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing an accident in 1982, accident number LAX82AA274, where three people died during an aerial filming operation in a helicopter, the NTSB recommended, Safety Recommendation A-84-016, and the FAA adopted regulations that require such operations to be conducted only by personnel who possess a Certificate of Waiver for Motion Picture and Television. To obtain a waiver, a Motion Picture and Television Operations Manual is required to ensure the operating and safety procedures are incorporated into that manual and, once accepted, it becomes part of the waiver. That manual is the standard by which a certificate holder must conduct all operations and within the manual is the Motion Picture Plan of Activities (POA). The POA is to be submitted three days before scheduled filming to the local Flight Standard District Office (FSDO) having jurisdiction over the area of proposed filming and details that filming location and operations to be conducted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the records of the FAA's Van Nuys FSDO, from October 2011 up to the accident date, 77 POAs were submitted, of which 11 were from the pilot. Of the 77 submitted, all but 3 were accepted, and the reasoning for those that were not accepted was either that they were out of their district or that no POA was required.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCrossbow Helicopters most recent movie manual was reviewed and accepted by the FAA in November 2011. The FAA issued an acceptance letter of the accident POA for February 9, 2013, from 1600 to 2200. The POA had been submitted by Crossbow Helicopters and signed by the pilot on February 1, 2013. The general outline provided stated that the helicopter would be engaged in landing and takeoff activities at a secured movie ranch. It additionally stated that the helicopter would make approaches from 500 ft above ground level into the safety zone and that the area had been scouted and found safe to conduct the flight activity.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe light placed in the cockpit for the purpose of illuminating the actor for the mounted GoPro camera was found within the wreckage. The Stiker FLEXiT Light was a flat red flexible silicone panel measuring 13 in by 7 in that contained 16 white 5mm LED lights. The light was equipped with 2 magnets for mounting and powered by AA batteries. The light was operated by depressing a button (3-mode electric switch) that would activate a low (2 lights illuminated), medium (4 lights illuminated), or high setting (16 lights illuminated), of which the highest setting would emit 128 lumens.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNight Flight&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA's Helicopter Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-21A), chapter 13, \"even in conditions in which visibility and ceiling are determined to be visual meteorological conditions, the ability to discern unlit or low contrast objects and terrain at night may be compromised. The ability to discern these objects and terrain is referred to as the 'seeing condition,' and is related to the amount of natural and manmade lighting available, and the contrast, reflectivity, and texture of surface terrain and obstruction features. In order to conduct operations safely, seeing conditions must be accounted for in the planning and execution of night VFR operations.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA's Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), chapter 8-1-5 (Illusions in Flight, Featureless Terrain Illusion) \"an absence of ground features, as when landing over water, darkened areas, and terrain made featureless by snow, can create the illusion that the aircraft is at a higher altitude than it actually is.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Airplane Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-3A, chapter 10, states the following about night flying: \"Distance may be deceptive at night due to limited lighting conditions. A lack of intervening references on the ground and the inability of the pilot to compare the size and location of different ground objects cause this. This also applies to the estimation of altitude and speed.\" The handbook further states that \"temporary blindness, caused by an unusually bright light, may result in illusions or after images until the eyes recover from the brightness. The brain creates these illusions reported by the eyes.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the American Optometric Association, \"while dark adaptation of the rods develops rather slowly over a period of 20 to 30 minutes, it can be lost in a few seconds of exposure to bright light. Accordingly, during night operations aircrew members should be taught to avoid bright lights.\" Also, \"the instrument panel should be kept illuminated at the lowest level consistent with safe operation, and the flyer should avoid looking at exhaust flames, strobes, searchlights, etc. to avoid temporary flash blindness. If light must be used, it should be as dim as possible and should only be used for the shortest possible period.\" -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "GPS tracking data revealed that, after departure, the helicopter proceeded westbound about 600 ft above ground level (agl), following a roadway. About 6 minutes after liftoff, when the helicopter was about 3/4 mile south of the accident site, it turned right and became established on a northerly course. The helicopter subsequently turned left and appeared to be on a southerly heading at the final data point. Shortly before beginning the left turn, the helicopter entered a climb, reached an altitude of about 1,800 ft agl, and then entered a descent that continued until impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather observations from the nearest Automated Surface Observing System, located about 7 miles east of the accident site, indicated that the ceilings and visibility appeared to be adequate for nighttime helicopter operations and did not detect any freezing precipitation. Although an airmen's meteorological information advisory for icing conditions was current for the route of flight, and several pilot reports of icing conditions had been filed, none of the reports were in the immediate vicinity of the intended route of flight. Witnesses and first responders reported mist, drizzle, and icy road conditions at the time of the accident. It is likely that the pilot inadvertently encountered localized icing conditions, which resulted in his subsequent in-flight loss of helicopter control.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed no preimpact failures or malfunctions. The engine control unit recorded engine torque, engine overspeed, and rotor overspeed events; however, due to their timing and nature, the events were likely a result of damage that occurred during the impact sequence. Evidence also indicated that the cyclic centering, engine overspeed, and hydraulic system warning lights illuminated; it is also likely that their illumination was associated with the impact sequence. Further, the engine anti-ice status light was illuminated, which was consistent with the activation of the anti-ice system at some point during the accident flight.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Light bulb filaments from the caution and warning panel were examined by the investigator-in-charge at the NTSB materials laboratory. The filaments associated with the cyclic centering, engine anti-ice, engine overspeed, and hydraulic system exhibited stretching consistent with illumination at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the aircraft flight manual, the cyclic centering annunciator light will be illuminated when the helicopter is on the ground and the cyclic stick is not centered. The engine anti-ice annunciator will illuminate when the engine anti-ice system is activated. Engine overspeed annunciation is provided when an overspeed condition is detected by the ECU. Hydraulic system indication is provided when the system pressure decreases below 650 psi. The normal hydraulic system operating pressure is 1,000 psi. - The accident aircraft was a Bell Helicopter model 407, serial number 53959. The helicopter was configured for helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) operations. The FAA type certificate required one flight crew member (pilot) and permitted operations under day or night visual flight rules (VFR). The helicopter was not certificated for intentional flight into known icing conditions. The operator noted that the helicopter was equipped for instrument flight; however, it was not certified for flight under instrument flight rules (IFR). The helicopter was equipped with heated pitot and static ports; however, the rotor blades were not equipped with ice protection. The helicopter was powered by a Rolls-Royce Allison model 250-C47B turboshaft engine, serial number CAE-847212, with maximum takeoff and maximum continuous power ratings of 650 and 600 shaft horsepower, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was issued a normal category standard airworthiness certificate in June 2009. The helicopter was purchased by Sun Trust Equipment Finance on April 29, 2010, and subsequently leased by Med-Trans Corporation. The helicopter was maintained under an approved aircraft inspection program. The most recent inspection was completed on December 28, 2012, at 952.2 hours total airframe time. A review of the available maintenance records did not reveal a history of outstanding maintenance discrepancies. At the time of the accident, the helicopter airframe and engine had accumulated about 956 hours total time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine anti-ice system is controlled by a switch on the overhead panel. When activated, the system routes air from the diffuser scroll to the engine compressor front support guide vanes in order to prevent the formation of ice. In the event of a loss of electrical power, the system will be activated and route hot air to the engine guide vanes. - On January 2, 2013, at 2057 central standard time, a Bell Helicopter model 407, N445MT, impacted terrain near Clear Lake, Iowa. The pilot and two medical crew members sustained fatal injuries. The helicopter was destroyed. The helicopter was registered to Suntrust Equipment Leasing &amp; Finance Corporation and operated by Med-Trans Corporation under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a positioning flight. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which was operated on a company flight plan in accordance with Part 135 of the aviation regulations. A flight plan was not filed with the Federal Aviation Administration. The flight originated from the Mercy Medical Center, Mason City, Iowa, about 2049, with an intended destination of the Palo Alto County Hospital, (IA76), Emmetsburg, Iowa.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness located about 1 mile south of the accident site, reported observing the helicopter as it approached from the east. He noted that it appeared to slow and then turn to the north. When he looked again, the helicopter appeared to descend straight down. He subsequently went back into his house and called 911. He described the current weather conditions as \"misty,\" with a light wind.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA second witness reported that he was working in his garage when he heard the helicopter. He stated that the sound of the helicopter changed as if it was turning, followed by what he described as a \"thump\" and then everything was quiet. He subsequently responded to the accident with the Ventura Fire Department. He reported that there was a coating of ice on his truck windshield that the wipers would not clear. He decided to drive another car to the fire stations because it had been parked in the garage. He was on the third fire truck out of the station and as they were waiting to cross Highway 18 at Balsam Avenue, they observed a Clear Lake police car, also responding to the accident, slide through the intersection. They informed dispatch to advise following units to expect slick road conditions. He noted that there was a haze in the air, which was evident when looking toward a street light; however, he did not recall any precipitation at the time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA pilot located at the Mason City Municipal Airport (MCW) reported that he saw the helicopter fly overhead and estimated its altitude as 300 feet above ground level (agl). He was leaving the airport at that time and noted there was a glaze of ice on his car. He added that the roads were icy as he drove out of the airport and onto Highway 18. He commented that he had flown into Mason City about 1830 and encountered some light rime ice while flying through a cloud.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGPS tracking data depicted the helicopter at the medical center at 2049:44 (hhmm:ss). After liftoff, the helicopter proceeded westbound along Highway 18 about 1,800 feet mean sea level (msl). The helicopter passed just south of the Mason City airport at 2052:44. About 2056:09, the helicopter entered a right turn, becoming established on a northbound course about 10 seconds later. The helicopter simultaneously entered a climb, ultimately reaching approximately 2,995 feet msl at 2057:04. About one minute prior to reaching the apex of the climb, the helicopter entered a left turn, which continued until the helicopter was established on a southbound course. The final tracking data point was recorded at 2057:14. The final data point was located about 774 feet north of the accident site, with an associated altitude of 2,723 feet msl. The published field elevation of the Mason City airport was 1,214 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted a harvested agricultural field. The main wreckage came to rest along a line of trees and bushes separating the fields. The debris path was about 100 feet long and was oriented on a 246-degree magnetic bearing. - An autopsy of the pilot was completed at the Mercy Medical Center, Mason City, Iowa, on January 3, 2013. The pilot's death was attributed to multiple blunt force injuries sustained as a result of the accident. FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute toxicology testing was negative for all substances in the screening profile. - The Mason City Municipal Airport Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), located about 7 miles east of the accident site, at 2053, recorded weather conditions as: wind from 300 degrees at 8 knots; 8 miles visibility; broken clouds at 1,700 feet agl, overcast clouds at 3,300 feet agl; temperature -3 degrees Celsius; dew point -5 degrees Celsius; and an altimeter setting of 30.05 inches of mercury. At 2100, the recorded conditions included a wind from 310 degrees at 9 knots, broken clouds at 1,700 feet agl, and overcast clouds at 3,300 feet agl. At 2105, the wind was from 310 degrees at 10 knots, with broken clouds at 1,500 feet agl and overcast clouds at 2,000 feet agl. At 2110, the wind was from 310 degrees at 12 knots, with overcast clouds at 1,500 feet agl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Forest City Municipal Airport Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS), located about 8 miles northwest of the accident site, at 2055, recorded conditions as: wind from 300 degrees at 9 knots; 10 miles visibility; overcast clouds at 1,000 feet agl; temperature -2 degrees Celsius; dew point -3 degrees Celsius; and an altimeter setting of 30.04 inches of mercury. At 1955, about one hour before the accident, the observation included a note of unknown freezing precipitation. However, this notation was not included in the subsequent observations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe MCW terminal forecast, issued at 1959, expected wind from 250 degrees at 6 knots, 5 miles visibility in light snow, and overcast clouds at 1,400 feet agl.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSatellite imagery depicted an overcast layer of stratiform clouds over the region with cloud tops near 11,000 feet. The regional radar mosaic for Iowa did not depict any significant meteorological echoes in the vicinity of the accident site about the time of the accident. However, the radar scan sampled the airspace from about 6,630 feet to 15,100 feet over the accident site. Any echoes below this height would not have been detected by the weather radar.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot reports (PIREP) filed between 1500 and 2400 over Iowa indicated light to moderate rime ice ranging in altitude from 3,500 feet msl to 8,500 feet msl. These reports ranged from Sioux City, at the western end of the state, to Dubuque at the eastern end of the state. The closest PIREP was over Spencer, Iowa, about 70 miles west of the accident site where a pilot reported light rime icing during climb at 6,400 feet msl. This was about 23 miles west of the accident flight intended destination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn Airman Meteorological Information (AIRMET) advisory for icing was current for the route of flight. AIRMET Zulu was issued at 2045 and was in effect until 0600. It warned of moderate icing conditions below 10,000 feet msl, with icing conditions expected to continue through 0900.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses and first responders reported mist, drizzle, and icy road conditions at the time of the accident. One first responder reported observing a police car slide through a roadway intersection due to the slick conditions while responding to the accident site. - The pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with helicopter and single-engine airplane ratings; his airplane rating was limited to private pilot privileges. He was issued a second class airman medical certificate on April 17, 2012, with a limitation for corrective lenses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot completed the operator's new hire training program on September 24, 2012, with night vision goggle (NVG) training completed on September 27, 2014. The pilot's Part 135 checkride was completed on September 29, 2012, and his new hire base training was completed on October 5, 2012.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of his initial employment, the pilot reported having accumulated a total flight time of 2,808 hours, with 2,720 hours in helicopters. Of that total flight time, 248 hours were at night. Duty and flight time records indicated that during October, the pilot accumulated 3.7 hours of flight time, all in daylight conditions. During November, the pilot accumulated 9.9 hours total flight time. Of that flight time, 3.1 hours were at night with the aid of NVGs. During December, the pilot accumulated 5.6 hours, all of which were at night, with 5.4 hours using NVGs. His most recent flight for the operator was December 21, 2012.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was on-duty for 12 hours the day before the accident, but did not log any flight time during that shift. The pilot reported for duty at 1820 on the evening of the accident. - Helicopter engine operation was controlled by a Triumph Engine Control Systems, formerly Goodrich Pump &amp; Engine Controls, model EMC-35R Engine Control Unit (ECU), serial number JG09ANU1247. One corner of the ECU housing was broken out, exposing a portion of the underlying circuit board. The non-volatile memory components related to the primary and reversionary governors was downloaded. The total ECU and engine operating times were 1,196.80 hours and 1,003.06 hours, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ECU did not provide for continuous recording of engine parameters. However, the unit did record engine fault and incident data. The ECU incorporated primary and reversionary governor systems, which provided redundancy for engine operation. ECU data was organized into engine history, last engine run faults, time stamped faults, accumulated faults, and incident data. Time data associated with each fault or incident corresponded to the engine run time. Upon logging of a fault or incident event, the ECU also recorded 12 seconds of pre-event data into non-volatile memory.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe last engine run fault data files associated with both the primary and reversionary governors did not contain any fault codes. The time stamped fault data file associated with the primary governor did not contain any fault codes. The time stamped fault data file associated with the reversionary governor contained a total of 21 faults. The most recent fault was recorded at 733 hours ECU operating time. Because the current engine operating time was about 1,003 hours, the most recent fault was recorded about 270 hours before the end of data, which was well before and not relevant to, the accident flight. The reversionary governor accumulated fault data file contained only faults also recorded into the time stamped fault data file.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThree incidents were contained in the snapshot data file. The first was recorded at 1,003:06:16.344 (hh:mm:ss.sss) engine operating time and consisted of a high engine torque event of 110 percent. The associated 12 seconds of pre-event data were unremarkable, with engine speed, rotor speed, and engine torque parameters within normal limits. The collective pitch parameter was about 58 percent and the fuel flow about 452 pounds per hour (pph) during this timeframe. Cyclic and anti-torque pedal positions were not recorded by the ECU. The second snapshot was recorded at 1,003:06:22.873 and consisted of a high power turbine event of 108 percent. An engine overspeed parameter is set due to this event. In addition, the collective pitch parameter had decreased to 32 percent and fuel flow to 36 pph at this time. The third snapshot was recorded at 1,003:06:22.920 and consisted of a high rotor speed of 109 percent. The loss of subsequent data was consistent with a loss of electrical power to the ECU at impact. In addition, the engine and rotor overspeed events, in conjunction with a decreasing fuel flow and collective pitch, was consistent with the rotor system being aerodynamically driven above 100-percent, such as in the descent prior to impact. - The helicopter impacted a harvested agricultural field. The debris path was about 100 feet long and was oriented on a 246-degree magnetic bearing. The helicopter was fragmented, and the cockpit and cabin areas were compromised. A postimpact fire ensued. The main wreckage consisted of the main rotor blades, transmission, engine, portions of the fuselage, and the tail boom. The tail rotor had separated from the tail boom and was located about 80 feet east-northeast of the main wreckage. The landing skids had separated from the fuselage. The left skid was located at the initial impact point; the right skid was located about 35 feet west of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blades remained attached to the hub; however, each blade exhibited bending and delamination consistent with ground impact. Separations of the pitch change links and one pitch change horn were consistent with overstress. The main rotor transmission remained attached to the fragmented upper fuselage bulkhead. The transmission drive input/output shafts and main rotor mast rotated freely. Examination of the freewheeling unit revealed that the shaft had fractured at the main rotor drive spline and at the tail rotor drive spline. Appearance of the fracture surfaces was consistent with overstress failures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe flight control system was fragmented similar to the overall airframe structure. Separations of the control tubes and support brackets appeared consistent with overstress failures. The hydraulic actuator servos remained secured to the mating fuselage bulkhead; however, the attached fuselage structure was separated from the surrounding airframe panels. Portions of the servos were deformed consistent with impact forces. The mating control system push-pull tubes and hydraulic lines remained secured to the servos.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom was separated at the forward end and was located with the main wreckage. The tail boom remained straight from forward to aft ends; however, the tail boom cross-section was deformed at both ends. The tail rotor assembly was separated from the boom. The tail rotor blades were deformed and fragmented consistent with impact forces; however, both blades remained secured to the hub. The pitch change links were intact; although, the green pitch change link was deformed. Continuity within the gearbox was confirmed via rotation of the output drive mast. The forward portion of the tail rotor drive shaft remained attached to the tail boom. A separation of a section of the drive shaft near the horizontal/vertical stabilizers appeared consistent with a main rotor strike at that location. The tail rotor bearing supports remained attached to the tail boom except for one support located near the horizontal stabilizer, which was separated from the tail boom and remained attached to the separated section of the tail rotor drive shaft. The bearings appeared intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination of the engine was performed under the direct supervision of an NTSB powerplant specialist. The engine exhibited deformation of several components, which appeared consistent with impact forces. The hydro-mechanical unit (HMU) was partially separated from the accessory gearbox; the HMU drive shaft was fractured consistent with an overstress failure. The compressor impeller blades, the impeller inducer shroud, gas producer rotor, and power turbine rotor exhibited rub marks consistent with rotation at impact. The power turbine N2 coupling was fractured near the forward spline consistent with tensile overload. The accessory gearbox components appeared intact and rotated freely. The engine bearings appeared intact, were oil wetted, and rotated freely. Dirt and corn stalk debris was observed throughout the engine air flow path. No anomalies consistent with a preimpact failure or malfunction were observed. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The accident helicopter was returning to the airport. Dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time with increasing fog. The pilot of a second helicopter, who was flying nearby and was in contact with the accident pilot, stated that, before the accident, he saw the accident helicopter make a right turn; he then asked the pilot if she was lost. The accident pilot responded that she thought she was. The second pilot told her to turn left toward the airport. Shortly after, the second pilot observed a fire on the ground and attempted to contact the accident pilot but received no reply. The accident helicopter crashed about 10 miles southeast of the destination airport. Postaccident documentation of the accident site revealed signatures indicative of a steep right turn while impacting vegetation and terrain. Examinations of the helicopter and engine revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. The dark night conditions, sparsely lit terrain, and accumulating fog reduced the visual cues available for the pilot to maintain orientation, and, under those conditions, the helicopter's external spotlights, which were on during the accident flight, could have further reduced or provided misleading visual cues. These conditions were conducive to the development of spatial disorientation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The FAA Helicopter Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-21A, Chapter 13, states the following about night VFR (visual flight rules) operations: \"The night flying environment and the techniques used when flying at night depend on outside conditions. Flying on a bright, clear, moonlit evening when the visibility is good and the wind is calm is not much different from flying during the day. However, if flying on an overcast night over a sparsely populated area, with few or no outside lights on the ground, the situation is quite different. Visibility is restricted, so be more alert in steering clear of obstructions and low clouds. Options are also limited in the event of an emergency, as it is more difficult to find a place to land and determine wind direction and speed. At night, rely more heavily on the aircraft systems, such as lights, flight instruments, and navigation equipment.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Advisory Circular (AC) 60-4A \"Pilot's Spatial Disorientation,\" reads in part, \"Surface references and the natural horizon may at times become obscured, although visibility may be above visual flight rule minimums. Lack of natural horizon or surface reference is common on over-water flights, at night, and especially at night in extremely sparsely populated areas or in low visibility conditions. A sloping cloud formation, an obscured horizon, a dark scene spread with ground lights and stars, and certain geometric patterns of ground lights can provide inaccurate visual information for aligning the aircraft correctly with the actual horizon. The disoriented pilot may place the aircraft in a dangerous attitude.\" - The helicopter was a Bell 206B3, serial number 1519. A review of the helicopter's logbooks revealed that it had a total airframe time of 5,179 hours at the most recent annual inspection, dated September 12, 2012. It was powered by an Allison Model 250-C20B, 420-hp engine. At the most recent 100-hour annual inspection, the engine had accumulated 9,236.1 total hours since new, and a total of 1,101 cycles. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe day prior to the accident, San Joaquin Helicopter's company documents recorded that the helicopter had a total time of 5,199 hours and 1,131 total cycles. The engine total time was 9,255 hours. - The two helicopters and the operator, San Joaquin Helicopters, which was located at DLO, were in communication with each other through a common traffic advisory frequency. - On January 2, 2013, about 0615 Pacific standard time (PST), a Bell 206 helicopter, N828AC, was destroyed when it impacted terrain in a vineyard while maneuvering about 10 miles southeast of the Delano Municipal Airport (DLO), Delano, California. The helicopter was registered to Maricopa Helicopter, LLC, Fresno, California, and operated by San Joaquin Helicopters under provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The commercial pilot, the sole occupant of the helicopter was fatally injured. Dark night visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The local flight originated from DLO about 0420 to perform frost protection.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) interviewed the pilot of a second helicopter, which was following the accident helicopter on the return flight to DLO. The pilot stated that they were both returning to DLO due to accumulating fog over the field they were working. The pilot stated that during the return flight, he saw the accident helicopter ahead of his position make a right turn and asked the accident pilot if she were lost. The accident pilot responded that she thought she was. The second pilot then gave her directions to turn left in the direction of DLO. The second pilot stated that he diverted his attention to reestablish visual contact with distant lights to his left, and subsequently observed an orange glow within the fog layer ahead of his position. He also stated that on the return flight the accident helicopter's working spotlights were on prior to the accident. - On January 4, 2013, an autopsy was performed on the pilot by the Kern County Coroner Division, Bakersfield, California. The cause of death was listed as \"blunt injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForensic toxicology was performed on specimens from the pilot by the FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The toxicology report stated no ethanol was detected in the muscle or the brain, and Trimethoprim was detected in the muscle and liver. - At 0615, the automated surface weather observation located 19 miles northeast of the Porterville Municipal Airport, Porterville, California, reported wind 140 degrees at 5 knots, 1/4 mile visibility, overcast clouds at 100 feet, temperature at 0 degrees Celsius (C), dew point minus 1 degree C, and an altimeter setting at 30.24 inches of mercury. - The pilot, age 62, held a commercial pilot certificate with an airplane single-engine land, multi-engine land, instrument airplane, and rotorcraft-helicopter ratings. A second-class airman medical certificate was issued in March of 2012, with no limitations stated. The pilot reported on her most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airmen medical certificate application that she had accumulated 1300 total flight hours, and 250 hours in the previous 6 months. According to the pilot's logbook she had flown a total of 212.6 hours in the last 6 months; 100.5 in fixed wing aircraft and 21.1 in helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter flight log, the pilot had flown the accident helicopter 2 days prior to the accident. The first flight was for training and currency, and was .6 hours in length. The second flight was for frost control work and was 4.5 hours in length. No other flight time was found with this operator in the previous 6 months. - The wreckage debris was located about 10 miles southeast of DLO, enclosed in an area of about 30 feet wide and about 500 feet in length. The direction of the energy path was oriented on a magnetic heading of about 040 degrees from the first identified point of contact (FIPC) to the main wreckage. Postimpact fire was observed throughout the debris path, as well as through the surrounding crops. The FIPC was the branch of a grapevine, followed by a large trough of disturbed dirt about 10 feet in length and about 10 inches in depth. About 15 feet further and in line with the FIPC, the main rotor, including the main rotor head hub assembly, blade grips and large sections of both blades had sustained impact damage. The tailboom was about 65 feet from the FIPC. The tailboom was damaged by postimpact fire damage and was buckled and separated from the fuselage at the fuselage attachment area. The tail rotor and gear box remained attached to the tailboom. The fuselage and engine were found about 75 feet from the FIPC. The fuselage was mostly consumed by postimpact fire. A leading edge section of the red marked main rotor blade was found approximately 480 feet from the FIPC with a magnetic heading of about 355 degrees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe postaccident examination of the airframe and flight control system components revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Examination of the engine revealed impact damage to compressor blade leading edges and inlet guide vanes, metal spatter and debris throughout the gas path. These signatures are supportive of engine operation during the impact sequence. For further information see the Rolls-Royce Engine Investigation Report in the public docket. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The medical transport helicopter was on a night flight conducted under visual flight rules (VFR) to pick up a patient for transport. The pilot had computer-based weather information available, but it is unknown what information he reviewed before deciding to accept the flight. Weather observation stations along the route of flight were reporting VFR conditions around the time that the pilot accepted the flight. About 17 minutes into the flight, the pilot reported to the receiving hospital's communications center that he was aborting the mission due to encountering inclement weather and was returning to base. Flight track data indicated that the helicopter initiated a right turn at this time, away from a nearby lighted windmill farm toward an area with sparse ground lighting . The flight track then showed a slight descent before the end of the data. The last recorded position was about 0.75 miles east-southeast of the main wreckage site. The helicopter impacted an agricultural field in an inverted, nose-low attitude. Examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.  Weather data and reports from first responders indicated that the flight likely encountered areas of snow, freezing drizzle, and supercooled liquid water.  The lack of ground lighting combined with the precipitation encountered likely reduced the visibility and outside visual references available to the pilot resulting in spatial disorientation and subsequent loss of control.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\nOn December 10, 2012, about 2016 central standard time (CST), a Messerschmitt Bolkow-Blohm model BK 117-A3 helicopter, N911BK, impacted the ground near Compton, Illinois. The pilot, flight nurse, and flight paramedic were fatally injured, and the helicopter sustained substantial damage from impact forces. The emergency medical services (EMS) equipped helicopter was registered to Rockford Memorial Hospital, and operated by Air Methods Corporation under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135 as an on-demand air-taxi flight. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated on a company visual flight rules flight plan. The flight originated from the Rockford Memorial Hospital Heliport (LL83), Rockford, Illinois, about 1958 and was en route to the Mendota Community Hospital Heliport (14IL), Mendota, Illinois, where it was to pick up a patient for transport back to the Rockford Memorial Hospital.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was based at the Rockford Memorial Hospital (LL83), Rockford, Illinois. The purpose of the accident leg of the flight was to position the helicopter for a subsequent air medical inter-facility patient transport flight from the Mendota Community Hospital to the Rockford Memorial Hospital. The request was received by the Rockford Memorial Hospital Dispatch Center and the pilot was notified at 1927. During the initial call requesting the flight, the pilot confirmed acceptance of the flight. At 1959, the pilot reported to the dispatch center that he was departing from the helicopter's base at the hospital. He reported that he lifted off with one hour forty-five minutes of fuel and three persons on board and was en route to Mendota, Illinois. During the initial radio call the pilot stated that the risk category was alpha. At 2010, the pilot radioed that he was 12 minutes from Mendota. At 2016, the pilot contacted the dispatch center notifying that he was aborting the flight due to the weather conditions encountered. No further communications were received from the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight track data for the helicopter showed that it departed LL83 at 1958 and proceeded south on a direct course toward 14IL. When the helicopter was about 13 miles from 14IL, it initiated a right turn. The initiation of the turn coincided with the time that the pilot reported that he was returning to base. The flight track then showed a slight descent before the end of the data. The last recorded position was about 0.75 miles east southeast of the main wreckage site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate with a helicopter rating. A type rating for Bell 206 helicopters was listed on the certificate. The certificate also listed private pilot privileges for single-engine land airplanes. He was issued a first-class airman medical certificate, with a restriction for corrective lenses, on July 17, 2012.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator's report, the pilot had accumulated 7,619 hours total flight experience with 446 hours in the same make and model helicopter as the accident helicopter. He had flown 27 hours in the preceding 90 days and 11 hours in the preceding 30 days. His most recent flight review was conducted on January 11, 2012. The flight review was conducted in a BK 117 Helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was assigned to a VFR only flight operations base. The training records indicated that during the January 11, 2012, flight review the pilot performed a limited review of instrument flight procedures. The instrument procedures listed on the training form consisted of recovery from instrument meteorological conditions, and an instrument landing system (ILS) instrument approach. Since the pilot was assigned to a VFR only operation, a full review of instrument procedures was not required.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to operator duty time records, the pilot had started his shift about one hour prior to the start of the accident flight. He had been on-duty a total of 61.2 hours during the preceding five days and had accumulated 2:47 (h:mm) of flight time, including 1:49 of night flight, during that period. The duty time records showed that the pilot worked shifts of about 12 hours each day. With about 12 hours of time off between work shifts.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was a turbine-powered twin-engine medium utility–transport helicopter with a single main rotor system and an anti-torque tail rotor mounted on the rear of the helicopter. It was powered by two Lycoming LTS 101-650 B-1 engines bearing serial numbers LE45139EA and LE45306EA respectively. Each engine was rated to produce 592 shaft horsepower for short durations and 550 horsepower continuously. The helicopter was equipped with two doors on each side of the helicopter and a two-piece clam-shell door at the rear of the fuselage under the tail-boom. The accident helicopter was configured for patient transport. In addition to the two pilot stations, the rear of the helicopter had provision for a patient litter, two rearward facing seats, and a two position side facing bench seat. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter had accumulated 10,836 hours total flight time as of the date of the accident. Engine number one had accumulated 9,800 hours total time in service and engine number two had accumulated 10,518 hours total time in service. The most recent inspection was performed on November 1, 2012 under an Approved Airworthiness Inspection Program (AAIP). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe pilot had WSI and Aviation Sentry Weather as computer based weather resources available to him before the flight, but neither system logs access, so there was no record or knowledge of the weather information obtained by the pilot before the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) Surface Analysis Chart for 2100 depicted a warm front stretching from northern Iowa northwestward into the northern Plains. A surface high pressure center with a pressure of 1021-hectopascals (hPa) was located in Oklahoma. The station models around the accident site depicted air temperatures in the mid 20's to low 30's Fahrenheit (F), with temperature-dew point spreads of 5° F or less, a west wind between 5 and 15 knots, cloudy skies, and light snow.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe area surrounding the accident site was documented utilizing official NWS Meteorological Aerodrome Reports (METARs) and Specials (SPECis).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRochelle Municipal Airport (RPJ) was the closest official weather station to the accident site located about 2 miles south of Rochelle, Illinois, and had an Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) whose reports were not supplemented by a human observer. RPJ was located 9 miles north of the accident site, at an elevation of 781 feet, and had a 1° westerly magnetic variation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1955, the RPJ weather observation was, wind from 270° at 6 knots, 10 miles visibility, light snow, an overcast ceiling at 3,100 feet above ground level ( agl), temperature of -1° C, dew point temperature of -2° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.93 inches of mercury. Remarks: automated station with precipitation discriminator, temperature of -1.3° C, dew point temperature of -2.4° C.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2015, the RPJ weather observation was, wind from 290° at 8 knots, 7 miles visibility, light snow, an overcast ceiling at 3,300 feet agl, temperature of -1° C, dew point temperature of -2° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.94 inches of mercury. Remarks: automated station with precipitation discriminator, temperature of -1.5° C, dew point temperature of -2.3° C.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2035, the RPJ weather observation was, wind from 280° at 6 knots, 7 miles visibility, light snow, an overcast ceiling at 3,300 feet agl, temperature of -2° C, dew point temperature of -2° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.94 inches of mercury. Remarks: automated station with precipitation discriminator, temperature of -1.7° C, dew point temperature of -2.5° C.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2055, the RPJ weather observation was, wind from 280° at 9 knots, 7 miles visibility, light snow, scattered clouds at 1,200 feet agl, scattered clouds at 1,800 feet agl, an overcast ceiling at 3,300 feet agl, temperature of -2° C, dew point temperature of -3° C, and an altimeter setting of 29.94 inches of mercury. Remarks: automated station with precipitation discriminator, temperature of -1.8° C, dew point temperature of -2.8° C&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirmen's Meteorological Information (AIRMET) Zulu and Sierra were valid for the accident site at the accident time. They were issued at 1445 and forecasted moderate icing between the freezing level and 12,000 feet (with the freezing level between the surface and 4,000 feet), and IFR conditions with ceilings below 1,000 feet and visibility below 3 miles in precipitation and mist:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRFD was the closest site with a NWS Terminal Aerodrome Forecast (TAF). The TAF valid at the time of the accident was issued at 1720 and was valid for a 24-hour period beginning at 1800. The TAF expected wind from 270° at 6 knots, visibility greater than 6 miles, and a broken ceiling at 2,500 feet agl around the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Area Forecast issued at 1345 forecasted a broken ceiling at 3,500 feet msl with tops at 7,000 feet. Until1500, widely scattered light snow showers were expected.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather radar imagery at 2017 cst near the accident site and aircraft's location indicated small droplets sizes, or a small amount of hydrometeors in the beam, hydrometeors that are spherical or near spherical in shape as they fall, and all the hydrometeors in the scan near the accident site had the same or very similar physical characteristics. One indicator, Zdr, was an indicator of the shape of the dominant hydrometeors. Negative Zdr values indicated a more vertical shape, positive values indicated a more horizontal shape, and values near zero indicated a near spherical hydrometeor shape. In between the aircraft's location at 2007 and 2017 cst there was a distinct change in the Zdr values, with two small horizontal bands of enhanced Zdr where the Zdr values were between 0.25 and 1.5 dB. The recorded Zdr enhancement indicated that these were areas where the hydrometeors were more horizontal than vertical as they fell, characteristics consistent with freezing drizzle and supercooled liquid water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCOMMUNICATIONS&#x0D;\nThe communications between the Rockford Memorial Hospital Communications Center and the pilot of N911BK were provided by the Rockford Memorial Hospital via a CD re-recording of the communications. The communications were provided in 6 sections. Each section was preceded by an audio header stating the date and time of the recording. The following is a transcription of those re-recordings.&#x0D;\nThe people recorded were as follows:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- PLT – The pilot of N911BK&#x0D;\n- RMH – The person on-duty at the Rockford Memorial Hospital Communications Center&#x0D;\n- MCH – The caller from the Mendota Community Hospital&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDecember 10, 2012 at 7:27 pm&#x0D;\n- Dial tone&#x0D;\n- PLT - react (pilot's name)&#x0D;\n- RMH - hey (pilot's name), (RMH CC employee's name)&#x0D;\n- PLT - yep&#x0D;\n- RMH - just checking to see how mendota looks&#x0D;\n- PLT - oh man you're going to start on me right away aren't you&#x0D;\n- RMH - hey I'm just trying to get it out of the way early&#x0D;\n- PLT - yeah it looks okay&#x0D;\n- RMH - does it all right i'll call you back&#x0D;\n- PLT - all right bye&#x0D;\n- RMH - yeah the pilot said that should be fine&#x0D;\n- MCH - really fabulous okay so what um it's going to be um doctor (doctor's name) is accepting&#x0D;\n- RMH - is that (patient name)&#x0D;\n- MCH - yes um do you have a room number for her actually do you have all the information&#x0D;\n- RMH - actually let me put you on hold real quick and get some info here&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDecember 10, 2012 at 7:50 pm&#x0D;\n- (Alert Tone)&#x0D;\n- PA ANNOUNCEMENT - attention react flight crew your flight to mendota is a go flight is a go patient weighs one hundred and five kilos and you're coming back through d as david three o four d as david three o four&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDecember 10, 2012 at 7:59 pm&#x0D;\n- PLT - and roc comm react one an hour forty five on the fuel three p o b's about 22 minutes risk category alpha&#x0D;\n- RMH - good copy React one&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDecember 10, 2012 at 8:10 pm&#x0D;\n- PLT – roc comm react one ops normal twelve minutes down to mendota&#x0D;\n- RMH - good copy react twelve on e t a&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDecember 10, 2012 at 8:16 pm&#x0D;\n- PLT – roc comm react one&#x0D;\n- RMH - react one&#x0D;\n- PLT - yeah we're going to have to turn around and come back uh we got ran into some weather down here we're going to have to go back to rockford&#x0D;\n- RMH - good copy aborting due to the weather&#x0D;\n- PLT - that's affirmative&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDecember 10, 2012 at 8:27 pm&#x0D;\n- RMH - react one ops check&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDecember 10, 2012 at 8:27 pm&#x0D;\n- RMH - react one roc comm ops check&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo further recordings were provided.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe helicopter impacted a level, harvested agricultural field in a rural area. About two miles east-southeast of the accident was a large windmill farm. Each of the windmills had a flashing beacon mounted on top. Except for the windmill farm, the lighting in the general area was sparse and consisted of only the lights from the widely spaced houses in the area. Ground impact marks and wreckage distribution indicated that the helicopter impacted in a nose-low inverted attitude. The helicopter was fragmented and distributed in a fan-shaped pattern to the north. The main impact crater contained the engines, main rotor transmission, rotor head and mast, and the cockpit section of the fuselage. The main rotor head was about four feet below the surface of the surrounding terrain. The cargo section of the fuselage and the tail boom were distributed along the remainder of the wreckage path. All four main rotor blades and the tail rotor blades were located in the immediate area of the accident scene. Subsequent examination of the wreckage included a partial layout of components, and examinations of the flight control system, rotor systems, transmission and drive system, engines and instrumentation. Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nAn autopsy of the pilot was performed by the Lee County Coroner's Office, Dixon, Illinois, on December 12, 2012. The pilot's death was attributed to injuries received in the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology testing was performed by the FAA Civil Aerospace Medical Institute. Testing results were negative for all substances in the screening profile.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\nThe AWOS at RPJ began to report light rain at 2135 CST (after the accident time) even with an air temperature reported below freezing. This was not an isolated METAR report as for the next 2 hours RPJ reported light rain several times when the air temperature was reported below freezing and below 28° F. RPJ was an FAA-approved Level III P/T AWOS which reported wind speed and direction, temperature, dew point, pressure, cloud height, visibility, present weather, and thunderstorm information and was within specification of FAA Advisory Circular No. 150/5220-16D. When the temperature was less than 28° F and precipitation was reported an AWOS-III P/T should have reported the precipitation either as snow or unknown precipitation 99 percent of the time. The AWOS-III P/T was not equipped with a freezing rain sensor or equipment. An inspection of the RPJ AWOS was done on December 18, 2012, and all RPJ AWOS equipment was and had been performing normally. The FAA Technical Operations Service provided the following information regarding AWOS equipment in the National Airspace System (NAS): &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAWOS does not generate a report of freezing rain without a freezing rain sensor. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll present weather equipped AWOS as well as ASOS and Automated Weather Sensor System (AWSS), can report light rain with a measured temperature below freezing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe present weather sensor is an intelligent stand-alone device that measures precipitation types and the rate of fall. The present weather sensor uses its internal built-in temperature sensor to report precipitation other than liquid precipitation (RA). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\nThe operator, Air Methods, was a commercial on-demand air taxi operator specializing in helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS). Air Methods provides air medical emergency transport services under three separate operating models: the community-based model, the hospital-based model, and the alternative delivery model. The accident base used a hospital-based model in which EMS helicopters and their crews received flight requests through the hospital's communication center. The hospital communication center was not staffed, nor was it required to be staffed, with certified aircraft dispatchers. The hospital communications center staff responsible for flight following functions were trained by Air Methods. The hospital communication specialist would receive requests for services, notify the pilot of the request for services, enter the flight plan into the computer system, coordinate patient transfer with the requesting agency and receiving hospital, and provide flight following services. Once a mission is in progress, the communication specialist communicated with the pilot through the aircraft radios when the helicopter is in flight and through the pilot's company-issued cell phone when the helicopter on the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnce a flight plan was entered into the system by the hospital communications specialist, the Air Methods Operational Control Center (OCC) in Englewood, Colorado, was automatically notified via computer. The OCC's mission from this point was to perform flight monitoring and continuing risk assessment for the flight. The OCC performed this mission for all Air Methods aircraft. The OCC consisted of two workstations, one of which was staffed with an experienced EMS helicopter pilot. The OCC system included GPS tracking and weather information overlays on computerized displays and the OCC staff had the ability to retrieve information on individual or multiple flights. The OCC computer system could monitor the flight progress, weather, position reporting, and other parameters and issue warnings to the OCC staff of discrepancies. The staff member would then review the warnings and take appropriate action. In the case of the accident flight, no warnings were displayed until after the helicopter had crashed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the risk assessment program employed by Air Methods used a risk assessment form consisting of 54 questions in three categories, pilot and medical crewmembers, aircraft, and flight request. Each question had a numerical score depending on the response. The sum of the individual scores then placed the overall risk assessment into one of four categories, low risk, medium risk, high risk, and extra high risk. The risk assessment worksheet listed that risks should be mitigated as necessary. High and extra high risk flights should have the risks mitigated or the pilot should decline the flight. The pilot reported the accident flight risk as \"alpha\" which is in reference to a previous risk management matrix employed by Air Methods which corresponded to the risk assessment naming convention within the Air Methods Flight Log (FLOG) software. On that matrix, alpha referred to the lowest risk category which is referred to as \"Normal Operations\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA printed copy of a risk assessment form dated December 10, 2012, at 1849 listed a low risk, but the flight request section of the form had not been completed. It was reported that the pilots would routinely complete the pilot/crewmember and aircraft sections of the form at the beginning of their shift to use as a guide in performing the remaining risk assessment tasks. Once a transport request was received and specific details about the flight were known, the pilot would refer to the printed risk assessment form and incorporate the specific flight details to arrive at a total score for the assessment. A fully completed risk assessment form was not required by Air Methods policies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSince the accident, Air Methods has implemented a required review of night flights for VFR operations without the use of night vision goggles (NVGs). This process requires the experienced Operational Control Analysts in the OCC to review the flight request before acceptance of the flight. This \"Conditional Flight Release\" is granted only if specific criteria are met that will allow for the safest possible operations at night without NVGs. Since the accident, all Air Methods helicopters have been equipped and are capable of night vision goggle (NVG) flights. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The passenger reported that the pilot was maneuvering the helicopter over an area of tree-covered marsh at a low altitude when the helicopter entered a descent, collided with trees, and impacted the ground on its left side. An examination of the wreckage found damage consistent with the main rotor blades being driven by the engine when they contacted the trees. Although the passenger reported hearing a loud sound before the helicopter started descending, postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunction or failure that would have precluded normal operation. The circumstances of the accident are consistent with the pilot failing to maintain altitude while maneuvering at low airspeed and low altitude, which resulted in the helicopter descending into trees.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 1, 2012, about 1420 central standard time, a Bell 47G-2 helicopter, N3755Z, collided with trees and impacted terrain near Walkerville, Michigan. The commercial pilot was fatally injured and the passenger was seriously injured. The helicopter was substantially damaged. The helicopter was owned and operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated without a flight plan. The flight originated from private property at an undetermined time.According to information provided by local law enforcement and the responding Federal Aviation Administration inspectors, the helicopter travelled at a low altitude when a loud noise was heard by the passenger. The helicopter descended and impacted trees and a marsh.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 49, held a commercial helicopter pilot certificate. On May 2, 2000, the pilot was issued an unrestricted second class medical certificate. On the medical application, the pilot reported having accumulated 4,000 hours of total time. The pilot's logbook was not available for review during the investigation. It is unknown when the pilot accomplished his most recent flight review.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe single engine, low skid, full bubble canopy, three-seat helicopter, serial number 1698, was manufactured in 1957. It was powered by a 200-horsepower Lycoming VO-435-A1 engine. The log books were not available for review and the helicopter's last annual inspection is unknown.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1414, an automated weather reporting facility at Fremont Municipal Airport, located 17 nautical miles to the south-southeast of the accident location, reported wind from 110 degrees at 7 knots, visibility 4 miles, haze, ceiling broken at 1,000 feet, broken at 1,600 feet, temperature 43 degrees Fahrenheit (F), dew point 37 F, and a barometric pressure of 30.03 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was located in a wooded marsh in the Manistee National Forest, also known as Tanner's Swamp. Only the trees within about a rotor disk circumference of the helicopter exhibited blade strikes. The helicopter came to rest on its left side. All parts of the helicopter were accounted for at the accident site and the helicopter was recovered and transported to a hanger for an examination. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInspectors from the Federal Aviation Administration and representatives from Scott's Bell 47 attended the examination. The main rotors were fractured a few feet from the rotor mast with corresponding impact damage to the leading edge of the blades. The flight controls were fractured in several locations, but exhibited no preimpact malfunctions. Several of the engine cooling fan blades had leading edge damage with signatures consistent with the fan being driven at the time of impact. Engine control continuity was established from the controls to the carburetor throttle shaft. The main fuel strainer and carburetor fuel inlet finger screen contained an unmeasured amount of fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was conducted on the pilot by Spectrum Health, Grand Rapids, Michigan. The cause of death was blunt force injuries of the chest and abdomen. The manner of death was ruled an accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForensic toxicology was performed on specimens from the pilot by the FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The specimens tested negative for carbon monoxide, ethanol, and drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBell 47 Flight Characteristics&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nScott's Bell 47 representatives reported the following concerning turns in a Bell 47:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA characteristic of the Bell 47 is a best power to airspeed combination encountered in level flight at 45 miles per hour (MPH), indicated airspeed (IAS.) This characteristic is often demonstrated in flight training and may be validated when in level flight at 45 MPH IAS increasing or decreasing airspeed by cyclic input alone results in loss of altitude. For this reason pilots must always be mindful of airspeed and power when maneuvering at low level and reduced airspeed. As 45 MPH is the best power / airspeed combination and also the target airspeed for best autorotational descent, this is also the best and safest airspeed selected for low level observation and reconnaissance flight. When turning downwind from stabilized flight into wind at 45 MPH IAS, if no control input is made, the turn into downwind will result in reduced airspeed and the aircraft will tend to settle. The settling tendency is avoided by a coordinated management of increased power and airspeed control to maintain the desired altitude. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter was in cruise flight about 500 feet above ground level, over a bay beach, when both of its main rotor blades separated. The helicopter subsequently descended into the bay, and the wreckage with the exception of the main rotor blades was recovered 2 days later. One main rotor blade was subsequently recovered about 1 month later, and the other main rotor blade was not recovered. With the exception of the separation of the main rotor blades, examination of the airframe and engine did not reveal any evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or anomalies. Metallurgical examination of the rotor hub and the recovered main rotor blade revealed features consistent with overstress, and no preexisting cracking or fatigue was noted. Additionally, damage to the teetering stops on the rotor hub was consistent with mast bumping. The observed mast bumping could have resulted from large, abrupt flight control inputs or from a mechanical failure of the unrecovered main rotor blade. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing and review of the pilot's medical records revealed a history of near nightly use of zolpidem (Ambien) as a sleep aid and frequent use of rizatripan (Maxalt) to treat migraine headaches. Neither condition or its respective prescription medication for treatment was reported to the Federal Aviation Administration and if it had been, would have most likely disqualified the pilot for a medical certificate based on the frequency of use/symptoms; however, the investigation could not determine the effects, if any, that the recurrent migraine, chronic zolpidem use, and underlying sleep problems might have had on the pilot at the time of the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "According to the FAA-H-8083-21A, Helicopter Flying Handbook, \"…mast bumping is the result of excessive rotor flapping. Each rotor system design has a maximum flapping angle. If flapping exceeds the design value, the static stop will contact the mast. It is the violent contact between the static stop and the mast during flight that causes mast damage or separation.\" - The two-seat helicopter, serial number 3644, was manufactured in 2004. It was equipped with a Lycoming O-360, 180-horsepower engine. The helicopter's most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on November 12, 2012. At that time, the helicopter had accumulated 3412.8 hours of operation. The helicopter had flown approximately 55.2 hours from the time of the last inspection, until the accident flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA mechanic reported that during the most recent inspection, he had found one main rotor blade exhibiting delamination. He then replaced both main rotor blades with used blades; however, the used blades had 142.4 hours remaining on their 2,200-hour life limit and were inspected before being installed on the accident helicopter. - On November 30, 2012, about 1512 eastern standard time, a Robinson R22 BETA II, N2626N, operated by Fly N Choppers, was substantially damaged when it impacted water, following a main rotor blade separation in flight near Apollo Beach, Florida. The airline transport pilot was fatally injured. The personal flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the local flight that departed Peter O Knight Airport (TPF), Tampa, Florida, about 1502.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to radar data provided by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the helicopter departed its home base at Clearwater Airpark (CLW), Clearwater, Florida, about 1405. It flew over the local area and landed briefly at TPF, before performing another local flight. Witnesses reported that the helicopter was flying along the beach, from north to south, about 500 feet above ground level. The witnesses heard a bang, followed by a main rotor blade separation. The helicopter then immediately rolled right and descended nose down in to a bay, about 200 yards from shore. The last radar target was recorded at 1511:51, indicating an altitude of 200 feet, about 400 yards from shore. Review of the previous five radar targets revealed that the helicopter had climbed from approximately 500 feet, to 800 feet, before descending into the water. - An Autopsy was performed on the pilot on December 2, 2012, by the State of Florida District 13 Medical Examiner's Office, Tampa, Florida. The cause of death was noted as due to blunt impact to the head and torso. Toxicological testing was performed on the pilot by the FAA Bioaeronautical Science Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Review of the toxicological report revealed:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"Rizatriptan detected in Urine&#x0D;\nZolpidem detected in Liver&#x0D;\nZolpidem detected in Urine\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the pilot's applications for FAA medical certificates revealed that he was first medically certified in 1973 and routinely medically recertified thereafter. The pilot did not report any medications, medical conditions, or physician visits until 2010, when he reported having had hernia surgery.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFor many years, the pilot's aviation medical examiner was his personal physician. This physician had prescribed zolpidem (a sleep aid marketed under the trade name Ambien) for many years with the caution \"do not fly an aircraft for 24 hours after taking this med.\" According to pharmacy records, during the last few months before the accident, the pilot had refilled this prescription monthly for 30 tablets each time. In addition, the physician had referred the pilot to a neurologist for evaluation and treatment of migraine headaches and was aware that the pilot had been prescribed rizatriptan (a vasoactive medication used to treat migraines, marketed under the trade name Maxalt) for these headaches. According to pharmacy records, the pilot routinely refilled his prescription for 9 tablets/month. According to the treating neurologist, the migraines were successfully aborted by this medication. - MacDill Air Force Base (MCF), Tampa, Florida, was located about 8 miles northwest of the accident site. The recorded weather at MCF, at 1455, was: wind 070 degrees at 8 knots; visibility 10 miles; few clouds at 8,000 feet; temperature 26 degrees C; dew point 13 degrees C; altimeter 30.17 inches Hg. - The pilot, age 60, held an airline transport pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, airplane single-engine sea, airplane multiengine land, airplane multiengine sea, and rotorcraft helicopter. His most recent FAA first-class medical certificate was issued on September 26, 2012. At that time, he reported a total flight experience of 31,500 hours. Review of the pilot's logbook revealed that he had accumulated about 290 hours of helicopter experience; of which, 10 hours were flown during the 90-day period preceding the accident. All 10 hours were flown in the accident helicopter. - The helicopter was recovered from the bay 2 days later. The engine and rotor mast remained attached to the airframe. The rotor hub remained attached to the rotor mast and the elastic teeter stops exhibited impact damage. Both spindle assemblies and their respective rotor blades had separated from the hub; one main rotor blade (with spindle assembly) was recovered from the water about 1 month after the accident and the other main rotor blade was not located. The tailboom separated about 6 feet from the transmission and the tailrotor remained with the tailboom. Both tailrotor blades exhibited impact damage. The horizontal stabilizer separated from the tailboom and the vertical stabilizer remained attached to the horizontal. The tailboom exhibited impact damage on the upper left side. The right skid remained attached and the left skid separated. The toe from the left skid was separated and not recovered.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit was crushed and the windscreen was not recovered. Localized impact damage was observed on the left lower side of the cockpit. Both collectives and the cyclic T-bar remained attached. The antitorque pedals on both sides of the cockpit remained attached. Continuity was established from the tailrotor through the tailrotor drive shaft, to the break in the tailboom, and in to the transmission. Continuity was also confirmed from the main rotor, through the transmission, to the tailrotor drive shaft. The cyclic remained connected via push-pull tubes to the mixer, where push-pull tubes were separated about 1 inch vertically of the mixer consistent with overstress. The push-pull tubes then continued to the swashplate. The antitorque pedals remained connected to push-pull tubes to the lower bellcrank. A push-pull tube had separated about 18 inches vertically of the lower bellcrank, consistent with overstress. Beyond the separation, the upper bellcrank was fractured and there was also a separation of a push-pull tube in the tailboom.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor heat was in the off position. The mixture control was in the full rich position. The magnetos were selected to both. The fuel selector was not recovered.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe valve covers and top spark plugs were removed from the engine and oil was noted throughout the engine. The spark plug electrodes were intact and light gray in color. The caps were also removed from the magnetos. The crankshaft was rotated by hand via the fan wheel. Camshaft, crankshaft, and valve train continuity was confirmed to the rear accessory section and thumb compression was attained on all cylinders. Both magneto gears rotated when the crankshaft rotated. The carburetor remained attached to the engine and was undamaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rotor hub and the recovered main rotor blade with spindle assembly were forwarded to the NTSB Materials Laboratory, Washington, D.C., for further examination. Metallurgical examination of the components revealed features consistent with overstress and no preexisting cracking or fatigue was noted. Additionally, damage to the teetering stops was consistent with a mast bump (for more information, see Materials Laboratory Factual Reports in the NTSB Public Docket.) -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter was in a hover about 120-150 feet above the ground while a utility worker performing a long-line operation worked on a transmission tower. After the loss of power, the helicopter spun and descended during which the worker was pulled off the tower by the attached long line. The pilot performed an autorotation that resulted in a hard landing. The pilot sustained serious injuries and the worker sustained fatal injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPostaccident examination of the helicopter revealed no usable fuel on board, and fuel quantities between the fuel tank and engine were consistent with fuel exhaustion. The examination revealed that the electrical wire to the start pump was not secured, which allowed for the possibility of  it interfering with the fuel quantity transmitter float mechanism, thus providing erroneous cockpit fuel quantity indications to the pilot. The examination also revealed that the low fuel quantity annunciator was inoperative due to separation of the fuel quantity transmitter's low-level fuel whisker.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecent maintenance of the helicopter's fuel system by the operator's maintenance personnel included the replacement of the start pump and testing of the low-level fuel light by electrically grounding the top of the fuel quantity transmitter using safety wire. A vacuum check of the fuel system was not performed after the fuel system had been opened. The method for testing the low-level fuel light and the lack of a vacuum check were not in accordance with the maintenance manual and the helicopter manufacturer's service bulletin relating to the start pump installation. Postaccident examination of the helicopter also revealed a nonstandard installation of an engine mounted fuel filter petcock drain valve.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo written company procedures and/or fueling records were available that required pilots to track fuel loading and time-based fuel consumption in order to determine time remaining for flights and their termination. The pilot stated that he would have the helicopter refueled when the fuel gauge indicated about 100 lbs. However, had the operator and/or pilot calculated the flight time remaining based on known fuel quantities that were independent of fuel gauge indications, then any fuel gauge inaccuracies would be have become apparent.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The FAA allowed the carriage of persons under Part 133.35 when the human external-load is \"necessary to accomplish the work activity directly associated with the external-load operation.\" Part 1 defined four distinct rotorcraft-load combinations (RLC). Class B RLC was defined as one in which \"the external load is jettisonable and is lifted free of land or water during the rotorcraft operation.\" Part 133.1(d) stated that persons \"other than a crewmember or a person who is essential and directly connected with the external-load operation may only be carried in approved Class D RLC.\" Brim Aviation provided rotorcraft external-load services for Great Southwest, carrying Great Southwest utility workers via long-line under the provisions of Part 133 Class B external-load operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the company Operations Specifications, Brim Aviation's principal base of operations was located at Ashland, Oregon, and no other bases were listed. The Lubbock FSDO did not know Brim Aviation was operating within their geographic service, which included Childress, Texas, and were not required to be notified by the operator or by the Portland FSDO of these operations. The Portland FSDO had oversight responsibility of Brim Aviation and did not know of Brim Aviation's operations in the Childress and Wellington, Texas areas.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe long-line worker, who was on the ground and witness to the accident, was requested during his interview by the National Transportation Safety Board Investigator-In-Charge (IIC) to provide the training materials he received during his training at ARS. These materials were not received by the IIC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Aviation Safety Program publication, FAA-P-8740-03, Time In Your Tanks, states in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"…the amount of useable fuel in your aircraft equates directly to how long your aircraft will fly. The longer you can fly, the more choices you have for ensuring a safe flight, consequently you can say flight time equates directly flight safety. …\" - The aircraft was a MD Helicopters, Inc. MD 500D (Hughes 369D), serial number 970191D, helicopter certified under Civil Air Regulations (CAR) Part 6. The helicopter was purchased by and registered to Brim Equipment Leasing Inc. in 2005 and was used in long-line and law enforcement operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was powered by a Rolls Royce, 250-C20B, serial number CAE-836143, engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with an ARS-Air Rescue Systems (ARS) belly band, part number: \"ARS-3RR 10a\", date of manufacture: \"22389-312A-10 of 10\", date-in-service: \"6-3-12\".&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe last maintenance inspection on the helicopter was a 100-hour inspection dated November 17, 2012, at an aircraft total time of 15,301.6 hours and a Hobbs time of 5,901.4 hours. The helicopter flew about 4 or 5 times since that inspection, which was performed in a hangar at Brim Aviation's Wellington, Texas, facility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the MD 500D Rotorcraft Flight Manual, section 2-11, Fuel System Limitations, Table 2-1, lists the usable fuel for standard non self-sealing fuel tanks as 1.9 gallons. Section 3-13, Fuel System Malfunctions, states that \"FUEL LEVEL LOW\" indicator would be \"ON\" when approximately 35 lbs of fuel (22.5 lbs usable) remain in the fuel tank.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators examined the helicopter for the presence of a maintenance discrepancy log. The only log found aboard the helicopter that contained a section for discrepancies, titled \"PILOTS REMARKS OR DISCREPENCIES,\" was contained in a \"Brim Aviation Engineering Log Book Report.\" The Brim Aviation Engineering Log Book Report began with its first entry on page 2401, dated November 11, 2011, and ended with its last entry on page 2446, which was not dated. Page 2445 was dated November 16, 2012.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnly two pages within The Brim Aviation Engineering Log Book Report contained airworthiness entries within the discrepancies section, which were on pages 2409, undated, and 2410, dated February 18, 2012. The discrepancy entry on page 2409 was: \"Throttle friction sticky\" and \"Pilot's door exterior handle non operational.\" The discrepancy entry on page 2410 was: \"Pilot's exterior door handle – inop,\" \"Gov. control linkage – Bolt spins – Retighten &amp; Re cotter,\" \"Reinstall Skid Mirror,\" Reinstall Steps.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no entries within the \"POWER CHECKS\" section for any of the pages from 2401 to 2445. The pilot stated that engine trend monitoring was not performed. The PILOTS REMARKS OR DISCREPENCIES sections of the remaining pages within this log contained flight/customer information. According to page 2440 of the log, an entry dated October 17, 2012, at a Hobbs time of 5,817.3 hours, and aircraft total time of 15,217.5 hours, within the \"MECHANICS: CORRECTIVE ACTION &amp; LIST ALL MAINTENANCE PERFORMED,\" states in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"Replaced airframe anti ice filer with new part.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"Drained and wiped clean fuel cell bladders, removed, cleaned, and reinstalled fuel boost pump.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"All work done IAW csp-hmi-2 and Rolls Royce engine\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe MD Helicopters, Inc. Maintenance Manual, CSP-HMI-2, B. Start Pump Installation, page 410, revision 19, states in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"CAUTION\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"Ensure start pump wire lead is wrapped around or tie-wrapped to the fuel supply hose so that there is no possibility of its interfering with fuel quantity transmitter float mechanism. Ensure electrical connections will not be strained by G-induced hose movements.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator's mechanic who performed the maintenance listed on page 2440, stated in an interview that he held an airframe and power plant certificate issued in March 2009 and did not hold an inspection authorization rating. He was employed by the company for about two years and has been the primary mechanic since July or August 2012. He said that his position at the company is that of a field mechanic and he works on four other company aircraft. He spends half of his time in the hanger and the other half in the field. He performs maintenance, fueling, ground operations, and the rigging of equipment. He said his maintenance training was \"on-the-job.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanic stated that maintenance to the fuel system was performed after a pilot, who he said was probably a pilot other than the accident pilot, reported a \"shudder.\" He said that he did not know if the report was made on October 4, 2012, and whether there was a written record of that report. He said that when he worked on the fuel system, he drained fuel from the fuel tank under both access covers on the floor of the cabin. The pilot helped him replace the start pump and flush the fuel system. He said that he reinstalled the sump drain and boost pump. The fuel tank was partially filled with a \"few gallons\" of fuel and the boost pump was operated and fuel flow was noted. He said that they removed the fuel quantity transmitter. He said that the pilot only removed the floor access covers to the fuel tank and held a 5-gallon bucket when they drained the fuel. The mechanic said that he was looking at the helicopter maintenance manual while he was performing the maintenance on the fuel system. The mechanic said that he did not perform vacuum checks of the fuel system and did not know how to perform those checks without reading the maintenance manual. He did not perform a vacuum check after working on the fuel system. When asked how he checked the low fuel annunciator light, the mechanic said that he grounded the fuel quantity transmitter by contacting the top of the transmitter with a safety wire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe MD Helicopters, Inc. Maintenance Manual, CSP-HMI-2, Fuel System Inspection/Check, page 501, revision 44, states in part, that testing of the FUEL LEVEL LOW WARNING LIGHT is performed by be refueling the helicopter with 35 lbs. of fuel remaining for commercial operations and 75 lbs. of fuel remaining for noncommercial machines. With the helicopter battery switch in the EXT PWR position and external power connected, the FUEL LEVEL LOW WARNING LIGHT must be off for these fuel remaining quantities.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe MD Helicopters, Inc. Maintenance Manual, CSP-HMI-2, Fuel System Inspection/Check, page 601, revision 19, states in part:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"WARNING\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"Air entering the airframe fuel supply lines may cause a power reduction or flameout. Fuel system vacuum and fuel air bleed procedures must be performed after opening fuel the supply system for any reason, prior to releasing the helicopter for flight.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mechanic stated that he did not have any safety concerns pertaining to Brim Aviation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA Order 8900.1, volume 6, chapter 5, paragraph 6-1378, (B), (1), (a), a current copy of the operator's operating certificate and current authorizations must be onboard each rotorcraft during Part 133 operations. The \"Brim Aviation Rotorcraft-Load Combination Flight Manual\" (RLCFM) and \"Operations Specifications\" that were onboard the accident helicopter at the time the accident were not current and had been amended. The 12-page RLCFM and 17-page Operations Specifications onboard the accident helicopter were approved by the FAA's Portland Flight Standards District Office (FSDO). According to the onboard Operations Specifications, section A001. Issuance and Applicability, only showed approval for the operator to conduct class A, B, and C external load operations. Section A003. Aircraft Authorization listed the accident helicopter with only applicable load classes A, B, and C. FAA records showed that the operator was approved for class D operations. The operator was requested and provided a current copy of their operations specifications following the accident, which listed under section A001, class D external load operations. Section A003 applicable load classes was blank for all of the listed aircraft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe only airworthiness requirements cited in the onboard and current operations specifications were in section A447, Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD) Notification, which stated that the owner or operator of aircraft identified in the certificate holder or operator's aircraft listing is primarily responsible for maintaining the aircraft in an airworthy condition as required under Parts 91.403a and 39. This section also section designated the certificate holder's EAD notification representative. There were no requirements within the operations specifications for compliance with service bulletins (SBs).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA SB relating to start pump wire routing was issued by MD Helicopters on September 15, 1987, that was to be accomplished within 25 hours of helicopter operation or at the next removal of the fuel start pump or fuel quantity sender unit, whichever occurred first and at each subsequent removal of the start pump from the fuel cell. The SB further stated there have been incidents where the fuel tank start pump wiring interfered with the fuel float after the start pump had been replaced in the field. The interference can result in erroneous fuel quantity indications.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMaintenance requirements for Part 133 Rotorcraft-External Load Operations are covered in Subpart D, which cites the following areas:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n133.41 Flight characteristics requirements.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n133.43 Structures and design.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n133.45 Operating limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n133.47 Rotorcraft-load combination flight manual.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n133.49 Markings and placards.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n133.51 Airworthiness certification&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRequirements for Part 135 Operating Requirements: Commuter and On-Demand Operations and Rules Governing Persons On Board Such Aircraft are covered in Subpart C for aircraft and equipment.

MD 500D (Hughes 369D), N28MP, experienced a loss of engine power during long-line power line construction. The helicopter subsequently impacted terrain during a forced landing near the transmission tower where the work was being performed. The helicopter received substantial damage. The commercial pilot sustained serious injuries, and the long-line worker was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Brim Equipment Leasing Inc. (D.B.A. Brim Aviation) under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 133 as an external-load operation flight. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that originated near the accident site, which was about two miles northeast of Childress, Texas.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe long-line operation consisted of a 50 foot long-line with a web seat attached to and suspended underneath the helicopter. The long-line worker was performing work on the power line while attached to the helicopter hovering overhead.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot said that they had planned to hang travelers on a section of east/west power line towers on the day of the accident. He said that on the day of the accident, a 15-gallon fuel load was \"working best.\" His rule for refueling was that he obtained fuel when the fuel gauge indication was close to 100 pounds, which he said would almost allow a ½-hour of flight time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA company mechanic said that the first operation of the day was to unclip the lines. A full load of fuel was loaded onto the helicopter with only the main tank fueled. He said that he remembered filling the helicopter with fuel two times and each time 15 gallons of fuel was loaded, which was the amount specified by the pilot. The mechanic did not know how much fuel was added prior to the accident. The mechanic said that the helicopter was gone for about an hour since its last refueling prior to the accident. The fuel added was not recorded in a log.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1400, the pilot departed on a flight to repair a section of fiber optic line that fell down before work continued on the towers. He then flew back and landed at the landing zone where the helicopter was re-rigged for crew operations and refueled. He lifted off with the long-line worker, and they worked on several towers. A traveler was hung on the tower near the accident site, and the helicopter was positioned in a stable hover about 120-150 feet above the ground. The helicopter experienced a pronounced sharp left yaw, which the pilot thought was from a wind gust. The pilot said that it was \"milliseconds\" between the left yaw and the engine \"winding down.\" The pilot did not hear any unusual noises or vibrations before the loss of engine power and the only annunciation he had time to see was the engine-out annunciation. He did not see any other red/yellow annunciators illuminate. The pilot applied right pedal input. The helicopter started to settle, and he then heard the engine out horn and saw the engine out light illuminate. The pilot's first thought was to get away from the tower because the helicopter would have hit the lower arm of the tower. As the helicopter moved away from the tower, he looked at the horizon and estimated that the helicopter was about 50 feet above the ground when he \"bottomed out the collective.\" The helicopter settled faster and onto the ground in a right-side-low attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA long-line worker on the ground said that he was about 200-300 feet away from the helicopter when he \"heard all the sound go away\" and \"it just shut down,\" while the helicopter was on the north side of the tower. The helicopter then spun clockwise 180 degrees when it lost power. He said the helicopter \"seemed\" to spin and turn \"pretty fast\" and did not recall how fast it spun. He said that the long-line worker was hanging on the traveler when he was pulled off the traveler by the long-line.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe long-line worker that was on the ground and witnessed the accident stated there was no easy way for a long-line worker to release from a harness and it would take several seconds to do so. The pilot stated there was no company policy or procedure for the release of the long-line. The pilot said that he could not \"specifically say\" that he was trained to release the long-line. If a long-line worker wanted to get off of the long-line, he had to be \"jettisoned.\" The pilot said that for the long-line worker to jettison themselves, they would have to use a knife to cut the long-line. - The pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. He reported a total aircraft flight time of 2,700 hours, of which 800 hours were in the MD 500D (Hughes 369D) helicopters.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSince 1990, he was a helicopter pilot in law enforcement and search and rescue operations. Since 2009, he was a helicopter pilot in Part 91, 133, and 135 operations. Until September 2012, he was employed as a full-time pilot flying Eurocopter helicopters for power line and freight flights, after which he was employed on a part-time basis.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 16, 2012, he was hired by Brim Aviation as a helicopter pilot. On September 17 and September 18, 2012, he received pilot training at Brim Aviation that was comprised of ground and flight training. Company Pilot Training and Qualification Record showed that the pilot's ground training consisted of ground testing, and the flight training consisted of two flights. The record did not indicate total flight, ground, and testing hours received by the pilot nor flight maneuvers he performed and the results of those maneuvers. The record had only two entries by the company president, who was also the company's director of operations, which stated the pilot passed knowledge and skill requirements outlined in Part 133 and 137. There were no entries to identify who provided and the pilot's flight instruction. During the pilot's post-accident interview, he identified the company instructor/check airman as the person who provided his flight training and testing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot did not have a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) record of any previous incidents, accidents, or enforcement actions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had been off work for several weeks prior to beginning work on November 26, 2012. The pilot said that he left his home in Chico, California, on November 24, 2012, to travel to Texas to begin work on November 26, 2012. On November 26, 2012, he slept all night and woke up once to go to the bathroom and woke up again at 0730 to start his work day. He worked until 0830-0900, returned to the hangar at 1000 after further flying was cancelled due to wind conditions, and went to bed about 2230. On the day of the accident, he left the crew quarters located in Childress, Texas, about 0700 and drove about 20-30 minutes to the hangar where the helicopter was kept near Wellington, Texas.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPart 133 did not have any crew member duty time/rest requirements. The pilot said that his work duration was dependent on a combination of daylight, time, and number of towers. In the southern areas of the country, work duration was driven by daylight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPost-accident examination of the helicopter revealed one bottle of 5-hour ENERGY drink in the glove box between the front seats of the helicopter. The pilot said that he did not take any prescription or over-the-counter medications before the accident flight. He said that he does not consume any alcoholic beverages while on work trips and did not consume 5-hour ENERGY drinks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot stated that he did not have any safety concerns pertaining to Brim Aviation. - The start pump wire was placed in various positions over the fuel quantity float/transmitter float in which the wire was resting on the wire and in position that entangled the wire with the float and the corresponding cockpit fuel gauge indication was recorded. With the float resting on the wire, the gauge indication was about 125 lbs. With the wire on a notch that was on the left side of the float, the gauge indication was about 90-100 lbs. With the wire entangled and to the left, the gauge indication was about 140 lbs. With the wire on the upper (outboard) side of the float are near its pivot, the gauge indication was about 100 lbs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA metallurgical examination of fuel low level spring wire's mating surface was performed by the National Transportation Safety Board's Materials Laboratory. A report of the examination stated that the based on the flat fracture appearance, the presence of ratchet marks, and crack arrest features, a fatigue crack initiated in the whisker. Due to the stepped structure associated with the fracture surface and oxidation on the surface, a demarcation for the fatigue terminus could not be reliably established. However, the presence of microvoid coalescence fracture features in the approximate center of the whisker indicate that final fracture of the whisker was due to overstress.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel truck from which the helicopter was last refueled from had been moved from the accident site to outside a residence in Childress, Texas, by the time investigators arrived on-scene. Investigators examined the truck at that residence the day after the accident. The truck was labeled Brim Aviation truck number 66 and was equipped with a tank labeled Jet A. The truck odometer was 93,275 miles. There were two bottles of 5-Hour Energy in a black colored metal wire-mesh basket located on the floor in the front seat area of the truck.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tank on the truck had a meter that indicated a total of 49,498.9 gallons and about 375.07 gallons of fuel pumped. A filter housing, installed between the fuel tank pump output and fueling hose, did not have a filter change date and did not have identifying information on the external housing. The housing was not removed to examine the presence of a filter element nor the condition of the filter element.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA binder aboard the truck had paperwork that stated that the fuel filter was changed \"DEC 2010\", and the last date that the fuel nozzle, tank, and filter were checked for contaminants and water was October 4, 2012. The following page in the binder had a blank entry next to the truck number and the page had its last entry dated \"11/30\". The \"From ODO Reading\" on the page was \"63770\" and the \"To ODO Reading\" was blank. Three entries for \"11/30\" stated:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMeter Start - 19415; Meter Stop - 19544; Total - 530; Jet A Loaded - Full&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMeter Start - 19726; Meter Stop - 19822; Total - 600; Jet A Loaded – blank with \"-96\" next to the column&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMeter Start - 19822; Meter Stop - 20103; Total - 500; Jet A Loaded – 220 with \"-281\" next to the column - The helicopter was located about 850 feet south of the intersection of County road U and 15 at an elevation of 1.848 feet mean sea level in a field near the tower, which had been worked on prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was oriented in about a 30 degree right bank and about a 5 degree nose down attitude. The tail-to-nose heading was about 170 degrees. The tail boom was partially separated near fuselage station 209. All of the helicopter pieces/components were located near the main wreckage. Two of the five main rotor blades were separated and located about 50 feet from the helicopter. The long-line was wrapped around the main rotor mast several times. Both helicopter skids were deformed outwards in an approximate lateral direction. The right skid was fractured at the center beam. Both helicopter skids were deformed outwards in an approximate lateral direction. The right skid was fractured at the center beam.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe area under and surrounding the helicopter did not contain smell, spill or blight consistent with a fuel spill.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left side pilot door was not in place for the flight. The remaining three doors were in place and locked. A belly band that attached to the worker's long line was routed through the rear cabin and beneath both rear doors. The external worker's long-line was attached to the belly band and was not attached to the cargo hook, which was in the closed position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the cockpit instrument panel revealed that the Master switch was in the off position. The Master switch was placed into the on position and the following were noted:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Main Trans Oil annunciator illuminated, the Engine Out annunciator illuminated, the Engine Out annunciator illuminated, the Generator annunciator illumined, a sound consistent with engine out/low rotor tone sounded, fuel gauge indicated empty, Fuel quantity low annunciator did not illuminate, sound consistent with an operating start pump and igniter sounded. The cockpit switch for the igniter was in the armed position.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel quantity float/transmitter had all of its retaining bolts with safety wire in place. During removal of the fuel quantity float/transmitter, three of the top retaining bolts, all adjacent to each other, exhibited a lack of torque. The fuel low level spring wire was not attached and not found. The master switch was placed into the on position and the float arm was moved from the bottom mechanical stop to its upper limit of travel. The cockpit fuel gauge indicated empty when the float arm was at the bottom mechanical stop and full when the float arm was at the upper limit of travel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA fuel system vacuum check was performed by using a hand vacuum pump to apply 8 inches psiv to the upper port of the fuel filter bowl. The system held 8 inches of pressure for two minutes and the check was ended. The check was repeated with the same result.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe drain line connecting the engine mounted fuel filter had a petcock valve installed, which was a nonstandard installation. The petcock was wetted with a fluid consistent with Jet A fuel. The petcock contained the following: \"Auto-Valve\", \"Dayton, Ohio\", \"Assy Date\" (no date was present), \"475C 61NSXBU\", \"206-041-634-3\" (which is a Bell Helicopter part number). The petcock was opened and approximately 40 mL of a liquid consistent with Jet A drained. The fuel line from the nozzle was removed and about a ½ teaspoon of a liquid consistent with Jet A drained.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was recovered from the accident site and placed in a hangar for further examination. During this examination, the helicopter was placed in an approximately level pitch attitude with a right bank attitude that did not exceed an estimated 5 degrees. The Master switch was placed into the on position and the cockpit fuel gauge indicated about 150 lbs of fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the fuel system revealed that fuel vents were unobstructed. A liquid consistent with Jet A was present in the following quantities and their locations: about 16 ounces from the fuel tank, about 8 ounces from the anti-ice filter, and about 2 ounces from the engine-mounted fuel filter and nozzle line. There were no ruptures in the fuel tank bladder. Access to the fuel bladder was obtained by opening both cabin floor access covers. About 16 ounces of a liquid consistent with Jet A was drawn out from the fuel bladder using a suction hose.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the start pump, part number 164A134-3, serial number 5685, \"FAA PMA\" revealed that the electrical wire to the start pump was not secured to the start pump fuel line as called for in the aircraft maintenance manual.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe airframe fuel filter was removed and the filter bowl contained a brown substance. The Master switch was placed in the on position, the filter bypass caution button was depressed, and the filter bypass annunciator illuminated.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine revealed no evidence of engine failure or malfunction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped with energy absorbing seats nor was it required to under CAR 6. The pilot's seat pan was deformed downwards about one inch. The left rear leg of the aft seat was not attached to the floor structure by an attachment pin. The pin was missing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Hobbs meter indicated 5,905.6 hours and was labeled with \"ADD 9400.2.\" -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot had positioned the helicopter facing toward a fuel island and had added about 40 gallons of fuel. A review of a security video showed that the helicopter cabin was partially under a circular metal canopy that covered the island. After fueling and while still under the canopy, the helicopter lifted off, and the pilot immediately made a right turn. After turning nearly 180 degrees, the helicopter pitched forward, and the tail and main rotor blades rose and contacted the metal canopy. The helicopter then began to flail while turning and subsequently came to rest after turning 180 degrees back to its original direction. Several seconds later, a fire and explosion occurred.     A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n  An review of the autopsy report revealed that the pilot's death was caused by thermal-related injuries and that he most likely would have survived the accident if no fire had occurred. The helicopter manufacturer issued several service bulletins advising owners to retrofit R44 all-aluminum fuel tanks with bladder-type tanks to improve the R44 fuel system's resistance to a postaccident fuel leak and the potential for a subsequent fire. The helicopter had not been retrofitted with these modifications. The NTSB has issued Safety Recommendation A-14-1 to the Federal Aviation Administration to require the retrofit.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Fuel Tanks&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRobinson Helicopters are equipped with either one or two metal all-aluminum main and auxiliary fuel tanks, which are installed above the engine firewall and on each side of the main rotor gearbox. In numerous instances, the fuel tanks have been breached during accidents, leaked fuel, and a post-crash fire occurred. In a number of cases, occupants have survived the initial accident, only to sustain serious or fatal injuries in the post-crash fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn December 20, 2010, RHC issued R44 Service Bulletin SB-78 recommending the installation of fuel bladders. Robinson R44 SB-67 and SB-68 address other fuel system crashworthiness components (fuel hose supports and flexible fuel lines) designed to minimize the possibility of a post-crash fire in the R44 series. Although not required, the design changes detailed in this service bulletin demonstrated compliance to a portion of the fuel system crashworthiness regulations in Title 14 CFR Part 27.952.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 28, 2012, RHC issued revision B to SB78. The revision directed an accelerated compliance date of April 30, 2013.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll R44 helicopters overhauled at the factory as of July 21, 2009, had the bladder kit installed automatically.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll new R44 Raven I models produced beginning with serial number 2066 (manufactured in October 2009) were equipped with the bladder tanks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll new R44 Raven II models produced beginning with serial number 12891 (manufactured in August 2009) were equipped with the bladder tanks.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to several similar low-energy accidents with fatalities resulting from a post-crash fire, the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) issued airworthiness directive AD/R44/23 on April 29, 2013, requiring installation of the bladders on all R44 helicopters by April 30, 2013. - The helicopter was a Robinson R44-II, serial number 12634. A review of the maintenance logbooks revealed that it had a total airframe time of 133.4 hours at the last annual inspection on February 2, 2012.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was a Lycoming IO-540-AE1A5, serial number L33351-48E. Total time recorded on the engine at the last annual inspection was 133.4 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the maintenance records revealed no unresolved maintenance discrepancies against the helicopter prior to departure. - On November 25, 2012, at 2308 Pacific standard time, a Robinson R44 II, N4204A, collided with a fueling structure at Corona Municipal Airport, Corona, California. The pilot/owner was operating the helicopter under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. The commercial pilot sustained fatal injuries; the helicopter sustained substantial damage from impact forces and post-crash fire. The cross-country personal flight was departing Corona for Fullerton, California. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA friend stated that he picked the pilot up at French Valley Airport in Temecula, California, about 1630, and they had attended an event in Temecula. He dropped the pilot back off at the airport about 2200.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses at Corona reported to first responders that they heard the helicopter, and then a bang followed by an explosion. They went outside and observed the helicopter on fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFueling records indicated that the pilot added 40.6 gallons of 100LL about 15 minutes before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of a security video showed that the helicopter was facing towards a fuel island, and the cabin was partially under a circular metal canopy that covered the island. The helicopter lifted off, and made an immediate pedal turn nose right. Nearing 180 degrees of turn, the helicopter pitched forward; the tail and main rotor blades came up, and contacted the metal canopy. The helicopter then began to flail while turning, and came to rest, after it turned 180 degrees right, back in the original direction. Several seconds later, a fire began that was followed a few seconds later by an explosion. - The Riverside County Coroner completed an autopsy. They ruled that diffuse thermal injury and inhalation of products of combustion were the causes of death.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Forensic Toxicology Research Team, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological testing of specimens of the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnalysis of the specimens contained no findings for carbon monoxide, cyanide, volatiles, and tested drugs. - An aviation routine weather report (METAR) for Corona (KAJO, elevation 533 feet) was issued at 2256 PDT. It stated: wind calm; visibility 2 1/2 miles mist; sky 300 feet overcast; temperature 12/54 degrees Celsius/Fahrenheit; altimeter 29.98 inches of mercury. - A review of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) airman records revealed that the 61-year-old pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument airplane. The pilot held a certified flight instructor (CFI) certificate with a rating for airplane single-engine land.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot possessed a third-class medical certificate issued on October 23, 2012; it had no limitations or waivers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo personal flight records were located for the pilot. The NTSB investigator-in-charge (IIC) obtained the aeronautical experience listed in this report from a review of FAA records on file in the Airman and Medical Records Center located in Oklahoma City. The pilot reported on his medical application that he had a total time of 1,500 hours with 50 hours logged in the previous 6 months. - Investigators from the NTSB, FAA, Robinson Helicopter Company, and Lycoming examined the wreckage at Aircraft Recovery Service, Littlerock, California, on November 27, 2012. Detailed examination notes are in the public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAirframe&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators examined the elements of the surviving warning light bulbs on the annunciator panel. All of the surviving elements were tight except for the \"clutch\" light, which was stretched.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor gearbox chip detector was clean, and the gearbox rotated freely by hand.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRotational scuff marks were on the upper sheave; there was rotational scoring on the cooling fan wheel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe sprag clutch operated properly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight controls&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll rod ends were accounted for, and all separations appeared to be thermal damage; investigators noted no indication of preimpact failure of the flight control system.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main tank remained attached to the fuselage with the upper half consumed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe auxiliary fuel tank separated from the fuselage, and was partially consumed by fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFire consumed the gascolator housing; the gascolator cup and screen were recovered, and both were charred.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel valve was in the \"ON\" position. Fire partially consumed the manual and auxiliary fuel pumps.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA borescope inspection revealed no mechanical deformation to the valves, cylinder walls, or internal cylinder head.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators manually rotated the crankshaft with the cooling fan, and obtained thumb compression on all cylinders in firing order.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInvestigators identified no mechanical anomalies with the airframe or engine during the wreckage examination. - Investigators examined the wreckage at the accident scene on November 26, 2012. Detailed site examination notes are in the public docket.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest partially under the metal canopy of the fuel island, which had a gash in it with torn metal sheets hanging down. The height of the top of the mast of the R44 was 129 inches (10.75 feet); the rotor radius was 198 inches (16.5 feet). The canopy was 14 feet above the ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter sustained severe fire damage from the mid tail boom forward. Fire consumed most of the cabin area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blades sustained impact and thermal damage. One main rotor blade spar separated; investigators located it in a hangar several hundred feet from the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor gearbox separated from the airframe with deformation and separation in the frame tubes. Fracture surfaces were jagged and angular.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor driveshaft had disconnected aft of the intermediate flex plate, and exhibited damage that was associated with severe thermal damage to the tail cone.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor blades sustained minor impact damage. There was rotational scoring at the tip of both tail rotor blades. There was a semi-circular ground scar with red paint transfer that arched counter-clockwise toward the tail section. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter was flying west down a hill over power lines that the pilot was inspecting when it struck the top of the power lines that were perpendicular to its flightpath. The tail rotor assembly separated, and the helicopter impacted the ground and came to rest inverted. Postaccident examination of the helicopter did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation; however, most of the wreckage sustained extensive thermal- and impact-related damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was hired about 3 weeks before the accident. He had no prior power line patrol experience, but he had completed a wire strike avoidance training module about 2 weeks before the accident. The accident occurred during the pilot's second work day of flying power line observation flights. After the accident, the operator instituted a policy requiring that all newly hired pilots obtain 100 flight hours of power line patrol-related flight experience with company crewmembers before being assigned an operation that would require flying with noncompany observers.",
    "FactualNarrative": "GPS Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Garmin GPSMAP 496 was successfully downloaded by the NTSB Vehicle Recorders Laboratory.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the recorded data, the helicopter departed ELM to the northwest at 1147:56, and then proceeded on a southwesterly heading for about 4 miles. The helicopter flew south over interstate 86, then turned back north and proceeded northeasterly, before proceeding about 1.5 nautical miles northwesterly, and then returning southeasterly along the same route. By about 12:07:10, the helicopter was proceeding westerly, north of interstate 86. From 1210:11 until about 1210:44, the helicopter flew northeasterly along the top of a ridgeline. About 1210:44, the helicopter proceeded southwesterly, crossing interstate 86 about 1211:12 at a GPS recorded altitude of 1,237 feet, and a ground speed of 36 knots. At 1211:27, the helicopter was in the vicinity of the wires that were struck at the accident site, and was flying at GPS recorded altitude of 1,014 feet, a ground speed of 43 knots, and a heading of 240 degrees. The last two recorded points were both at a GPS recorded altitude of 1,010 feet, at 1211:34 and 1211:57. The point recorded at 1211:34, was at a heading of 245 degrees and a ground speed of 11 knots. The last point was recorded on a heading of 33 degrees and a ground speed of 1 knot. - The four-place helicopter, serial number 470117D, was manufactured in 1977, and was primarily constructed of aluminum alloy. The main rotor was a fully articulated five-bladed system, with anti-torque provided by a two-bladed semi-rigid type tail rotor. It was powered by an Allison M250-C20B, serial number CAE-836392, turboshaft engine, with a takeoff power rating of 420-shaft horsepower.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped in a standard left side single pilot configuration. It was also equipped with a wire strike cutting system on the top and bottom portions of the fuselage. The operator reported that the helicopter's most recent 100-hour inspection was performed on October 19, 2012. At that time, the helicopter had been operated for 21,918 total hours. The helicopter had been operated for about 75 hours since the inspection. The engine was manufactured on May 5, 1989, and had been operated for about 12,500 hours since new. - On November 15, 2012, at 1211 eastern standard time, a Hughes 369D, N369AW, operated by Haverfield Aviation Inc., was substantially damaged following a collision with power lines and terrain in Corning, New York. The commercial pilot and the observer were fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan had been filed for the flight that departed the Elmira-Corning Regional Airport (ELM), Horseheads, New York, about 1145. The aerial observation flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe observer was a utility company employee.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the helicopter was temporarily based at the Tri-Cities Airport (CZG) in Endicott, New York, and was being utilized to inspect the power lines after a recent storm. The helicopter conducted an uneventful flight earlier in the day and was subsequently refueled at ELM, before continuing survey operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWitnesses observed the helicopter flying west, down a hill over power lines which extended east to west. One witness stated that the helicopter appeared below the highest tower, shortly before it struck the top of power lines that extended to the south, perpendicular to the helicopter's flight path. The witness further stated that he did not hear any changes in the rhythm of the rotor blades prior to the impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor assembly separated, the helicopter impacted the ground and came to rest inverted. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the main wreckage. On site examination of the helicopter was performed by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector, who noted power lines wrapped around the main rotor assembly. In addition, the power company reported two power lines \"tripped out\" at 1211.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA handheld Garmin GPSMAP 496 global positioning system receiver was recovered from the accident site and forwarded to the NTSB Vehicle Recorders Laboratory, Washington, DC for data download. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot by the Office of the Medical Examiner, Monroe County, New York. The autopsy report revealed the cause of death as \"multiple blunt force injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing was performed on the pilot by the FAA Bioaeronautical Science Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma was negative for tested substances. - The reported weather at ELM, which was located about 8 miles east of the accident site, at an elevation 955 feet mean sea level, at 1153, was: clear skies; visibility 10 statute miles; wind calm; temperature 3 degrees Celsius (C); dew point -2 degrees C; altimeter 30.37 inches of mercury. - The pilot, age 24, held a commercial pilot certificate, with ratings for rotorcraft and instrument helicopter. He also held a rotorcraft flight instructor certificate. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on March 27, 2012. At that time, he reported a total flight experience of 1,350 hours, which included 30 hours during the previous 6 months. His most recent flight review was conducted on November 8, 2012, in the same make and model as the accident helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to company records, the pilot was hired by Haverfield Aviation on October 22, 2012. He had no prior power line patrol experience and completed a \"Helicopter Accident Reduction – Wire Strike Avoidance\" training module on October 28, 2012. At the time of the accident, the pilot had accumulated about 1,635 hours of total flight experience, which included about 10 hours in the same make and model as the accident helicopter, of which 5.2 hours were accumulated during the 24 hours that preceded the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident occurred during the pilot's second work day of flying power line aerial observation flights.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a company representative, after the accident, Haverfield Aviation instituted a policy requiring that all new hire pilots obtain 100 flight hours of power line patrol related flight experience with company crewmembers prior to being assigned an operation that would require flying with non-company observers. - Examination of the helicopter after recovery did not reveal any preimpact malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation; however, the wreckage, with the exception of the tail boom and tail rotor assembly sustained extensive thermal and impact related damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEvidence of wire contact marks were observed on the main rotor blades, tail rotor blades, tail empennage, and the landing gear skid assembly. The helicopter's wire strike system showed no evidence of wire contact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll observed main rotor blades contained bent and/or broken spars, wrinkled and punctured skin, and varying degrees of trailing edge separation. The white, blue, and yellow blades were separated from the hub at their respective pitch change housings. The green blade was fractured outboard of Blade Station 105 and the outboard section was not recovered. The red blade was fractured just outboard of the root fitting doubler. A majority of the blue blade was not recovered; although a 12 inch section of trailing edge was located from the vicinity of Blades Station 45.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nContinuity of the drivetrain system could not be established due to impact and fire damage. The main transmission was intact. The output drive gear, transmission input pinion assembly and the tail rotor output pinion assembly rotated freely when manipulated by hand. The upper transmission magnetic chip detector plug was absent of metallic debris. The lower transmission magnetic chip detector plug was not located.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor driveshaft separated into four main sections, which corresponded with the position and length of fractures observed on the tail boom. The tail boom damage was consistent with main rotor blade contact. The tail rotor gearbox, rotor blades, and pitch control assemblies sustained minor damage and could be manipulated normally.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was entangled in airframe structure and wiring. Extraction of the engine revealed extensive postcrash fire damage. Neither the N1 nor the N2 drive trains could be manually rotated. The accessory gearbox, including both chip detectors was consumed by fire. The compressor remained in its normal position. The first stage axial blades exhibited nicking of multiple leading edge surfaces with deflection of several leading edge surfaces bent opposite the direction of blade rotation. The No. 1 turbine wheel was ashen coated, but otherwise normal in appearance. The fuel pump displayed evidence of thermal exposure with melting of the body and fuel pump bowl, which exposed the fuel filter. Both the power turbine governor and fuel control units were destroyed by fire damage. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The night, public flight was being operated to support ground-based police personnel in locating a missing child. Witnesses reported observing the helicopter at a very low altitude with the search light on maneuvering near the intersection of two city streets. Witness statements indicated that, as the helicopter neared the intersection, the landing gear skids collided with wires at the top a 42-foot power pole. The helicopter then flipped over and crashed into the street. Recorded radar data were consistent with the witness statements. An examination of the airframe did not reveal evidence of malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Rotational scoring found on the internal engine components indicates that the engine had power at impact. No distress calls were received from the flight crew before the crash. Most of the pilot's peers described him as \"meticulous,\" \"capable,\" and \"competent\"; however, one pilot stated that the accident pilot had a tendency to \"fly low.\"",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn November 3, 2012, about 2245 eastern daylight time, a Hughes OH-6A, N368PD, was substantially damaged following a collision with power lines and terrain while maneuvering at Atlanta, Georgia. The commercial pilot and a pilot-rated tactical flight officer (TFO) were fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to and operated by the Atlanta Police Department (APD) as a public use flight. Night, visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed. The flight originated at Hartsfield Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) at 2224.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe purpose of the flight was to support ground-based police personnel in locating a missing child. The search area was about 6 to 7 nautical miles northwest of ATL. The pilot was flying in the right cockpit seat and the TFO was in the left cockpit seat. A review of recorded APD voice communications revealed that the TFO made a \"three minutes out\" call, a \"two minutes out\" call, and then he reported that the flight was \"26\" (on station). There were no distress calls received from the flight crew prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was observed on radar, maneuvering, immediately prior to the accident. The radar data revealed that the helicopter traveled southbound, across Interstate 20, at about 1,300 feet above mean sea level (msl). The helicopter was then observed in a left turn of about 270 degrees, to a westerly heading. The last three recorded radar returns showed the helicopter at 1,200 feet msl (about 200 feet above ground level). The last recorded radar return was about 0.17 nm east of the accident site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident occurred within the city limits of Atlanta and several people witnessed the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn APD officer was in her personal vehicle, adjacent to the accident site, when she observed the helicopter traveling in a northwesterly direction. She observed that it was a police helicopter and the searchlight was on and pointed down. The helicopter disappeared from her view and she heard noises, like \"sparking\" sounds. She looked up and the searchlight had disappeared. She heard two loud explosions and saw the helicopter on the ground, engulfed in flames. When she initially observed the helicopter in flight, the engine was running it was traveling straight and not descending. The helicopter was not spinning or twisting, and seemed normal in appearance to her. She observed no smoke or anything unusual prior to the crash.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother APD officer was in his personal vehicle at the same intersection at the time of the accident. He observed an object \"explode\" in his peripheral vision and noticed that a transformer had exploded and something was on fire. A few seconds later the helicopter fell into the street and exploded.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOne witness was sitting on a wall with friends when he observed the helicopter traveling toward the local mass transit station, \"very low.\" He said to his friends, \"That helicopter is flying too [expletive] low!\" The helicopter then hit a \"transformer or something\" and \"nose-dived\" into the street and exploded. He stated that the engine sounded normal before the crash and he could hear the rotor blades. He reported that the helicopter was \"down low like it was chasing something\" and the helicopter's searchlight was on. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother witness was in the parking lot of a gas station, adjacent to the accident site. She saw the helicopter and said, \"Why is that helicopter flying so low?\" She observed the helicopter at the same altitude and did not see it climbing or descending. She observed that the bottom of helicopter \"caught the wires and it just flipped over into the street and blew up.\" Just prior to striking the wires, the helicopter was not climbing or descending, and it was not spinning. She stated that the helicopter made a \"sputtering\" sound, but she did not know what one was supposed to sound like.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother witness was on the balcony of her apartment with a friend when she observed the helicopter at a very low altitude. She stated that the helicopter made two complete circles and during the third circle, the helicopter hit the wires and exploded. The helicopter was at the same altitude during all three circles. The helicopter's searchlight was on and pointed down just prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses were interviewed by APD personnel at a local precinct after the accident. The interviews were recorded on video and copies were provided to the NTSB Investigator-in-Charge (IIC). The IIC recorded observations of the video contents (Video Reviews) and those reviews are contained in the public docket for this accident investigation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a commercial pilot certificate with a rating for rotorcraft-helicopter. He reported a total flight experience of 2,900 hours, including 70 hours during the last six months, on his second class medical certificate application, dated September 27, 2012. His last annual flight review/unit check ride occurred on March 6, 2012, in a MD Helicopters 369E.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the pilot's logbook revealed about 2,933 hours total time, all in helicopters. He also recorded about 2,354 hours of night time. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe TFO held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single engine land, airplane multiengine land, and instrument airplane. He did not hold a rotorcraft rating. He reported a total flight experience of 600 hours, including 0 hours during the last six months, on his second class medical certificate application, dated August 8, 2012. He was not yet fully qualified as a TFO and was still receiving on-the-job training at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was a single-engine, high skid (extended gear) rotorcraft, serial number 1180900, and was manufactured in 1967. It was powered by a Rolls-Royce T63-A720 series engine rated at 420 shaft horsepower. The helicopter was equipped with a Spectrolab Nightsun SX-5 searchlight and a thermal imaging (FLIR) system. The helicopter was not equipped with night vision goggles. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the helicopter maintenance records revealed that the most recent annual inspection was accomplished on August 23, 2012, at an airframe total time of 6,528.7 hours. The engine total time at the annual inspection was 1794.5 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 2053 surface weather observation for Fulton County Airport (FTY), located about 3 miles northwest of the accident site, included sky clear, calm wind, with visibility 10 statute miles or greater.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of the accident site revealed the helicopter collided with wires at the top of a 42-foot-high power pole near the intersection of two roads. The elevation of the road at the main wreckage was about 1,010 feet. The main wreckage came to rest in the center of the road adjacent to the power pole. A post-crash fire ensued and the fuselage sustained substantial fire damage. Several loose, unused ammunition rounds were observed on the street within the area of the fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUtility company crews replaced the wires and provided the damaged parts to the investigation team. The wires showed evidence of arcing and impact damage. Support structure for the wires and ceramic insulators were also damaged and broken.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll main rotor blades were accounted for within the area of the main wreckage. The tail boom of the helicopter was separated from the fuselage and was found adjacent to the main wreckage. The tail rotor blades remained attached to the tail rotor gearbox. Signatures consistent with wire contact were found on the tail boom and on one main rotor blade. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was examined on November 5, 2012 at an aircraft recovery facility at Griffin, Georgia. The majority of the helicopter was consumed by fire. The cockpit and cabin sections were completely consumed by fire. The aft fuselage (\"turtle back\") was protected by a stainless steel firewall and was not burned. The tail boom fairing and engine inlet fairing were consumed by fire except for a small section of the aft lower section of the tail boom fairing at the aft jack point. The boom fairing attach points were torn from the turtle back structure. Three main sections remained; the main rotor hub with blades and transmission, the engine and the tail boom section.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mast, main rotor hub, and flight controls above the mast rails were generally not damaged by fire. The tunnel flight control rods were consumed by fire below the upper rod end bearings. Flight control continuity from the remaining sections of the tunnel control rods to the main rotors was verified except for some fractures as a result of impact. All main rotor blades were severely bent and deformed. The yellow main rotor blade tip was separated outboard of blade station 111. The separated blade section showed impact damage to the leading edge. The yellow blade pitch housing, straps and damper attachment showed corresponding damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe transmission rotated by hand without binding and no chips were observed on the chip detectors. The engine driveshaft couplings were bent but the driveshaft was still connected to the engine. The forward section of the tail rotor driveshaft was completely consumed by fire. The tail rotor coupling was intact, but exhibited heat damage. The overrunning clutch operated normally. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was generally protected by the firewall; however, sections of the engine were burned and the engine was heat damaged. With the exception of fire damage, no obvious damage to the engine was noted. The engine was shipped to manufacturer's facilities for subsequent examination. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn extended landing gear was installed. The assembly was broken away from the fuselage and exhibited multiple fractures and was complete except for some burned sections that remained with the fuselage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom section included the upper and lower vertical stabilizers, the tail rotor transmission, and the tail rotor assembly. The tail boom was broken from the boom fairing just forward of the tail boom mounting frame. The lower vertical had impact crushing on the left side of the leading edge and was broken at the attach point. The tail rotor blades exhibited minor impact damage. The tail rotor transmission output shaft was bent together with one pitch link. The tail rotor swashplate and pitch control moved freely. The mounting arm for the tail rotor control bellcrank on the tail rotor transmission was broken from impact. The tail rotor transmission rotated normally and there were no chips observed on the chip detector. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPilot&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postmortem examination of the pilot was performed at the offices of Fulton County Medical Examiner, Atlanta, Georgia, on November 4, 2012. The autopsy report noted the cause of death as \"Blunt Force Head Injuries\" and the manner of death was \"accident.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForensic toxicology testing was performed on specimens of the pilot by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory (CAMI), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The CAMI toxicology report indicated no carbon monoxide, cyanide, ethanol, or drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTFO&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postmortem examination of the TFO was performed at the offices of Fulton County Medical Examiner, Atlanta, Georgia, on November 4, 2012. The autopsy report noted the cause of death as \"Blunt Force Chest Trauma and Thermal Injury\" and the manner of death was \"accident.\" &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForensic toxicology testing was performed on specimens of the TFO by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory (CAMI), Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The CAMI toxicology report indicated no carbon monoxide, cyanide, ethanol, or drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was disassembled and examined at the Rolls-Royce facilities at Indianapolis, Indiana on January 22, 2013. During the engine examination, nothing was discovered that would prevent normal engine operation. Rotational scoring signatures were observed in the stage four nozzle in the blade tracks of both the stage three and stage four wheels that were consistent with engine operation at impact. Rotational scoring signatures on the compressor impeller shroud from contact with the compressor impeller were observed and were consistent with engine operation at impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth the power turbine governor and fuel control unit remained in their normal positions. Both displayed blackening from post-crash fire exposure, but were otherwise normal in appearance. Removal of the fuel control fuel inlet fitting revealed that the internal fuel filter was melted. Both the fuel control throttle arm and the power turbine governor arms were slightly stiff, but could be manually actuated from stop to stop.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 14, 2013, the fuel control unit and the power turbine governor were disassembled and examined at the Honeywell facilities at South Bend, Indiana. No failed parts were discovered within either unit that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReports of the engine and engine controls inspections are included in the public docket for this accident investigation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInterviews with APD Helicopter Unit Personnel&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn November 15, 2012, the NTSB IIC visited the APD Helicopter Unit and interviewed available flight crews. The scope of the interviews included the qualifications and experience of the accident flight crew, unit policies and procedures, particulars of the accident flight, and the unit safety program. Records of the individual interviews are located in the public docket for this accident investigation. The following is a factual synopsis of those interviews.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident flight was the first flight of the day for the unit as there was no day shift manned that day. The evening shift began at 1600 and was to end at midnight; the pilot and TFO reported for duty at 1600. A call came in to respond to a missing child, and the flight crew began preparation for the flight, which included a review of the weather, locating the search area on a map, and performing the preflight procedures for the aircraft. The unit's Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) included locating missing children in a prioritized list of mission objectives. The mission objectives were rated 1 through 9, with 1 being the highest priority. \"Missing children\" were ranked at a \"6\" on the scale.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe unit's flight crew reading file included an entry on minimum altitudes. The file entry stated that aircraft should remain at 500 feet agl until in contact with the ground unit; the ground unit or supervisor would then clear the flight to proceed at lower altitudes. One unit pilot reported that, on a mission of this type, it would not be possible to discern a missing child from 500 feet, at night, and a lower altitude would be required. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilots interviewed generally regarded the accident pilot as meticulous, capable, and competent. He knew the local area well and enjoyed flying at night. He had no problems passing check rides and other pilots were comfortable flying with him. Most of the unit pilots had not observed the accident pilot flying \"too low.\" One pilot did report that, if any pilot in the unit had a tendency to fly low, it was the accident pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRegarding the unit's safety program, a unit TFO also assumed the role of Unit Safety Officer. When asked about the safety culture in the unit, he responded that it was \"very strong\" and the pilots understood to \"knock it off\" if safety of flight dictated. The Safety Officer produced a monthly safety newsletter and examples were provided to the NTSB IIC. The unit did not have a formal risk assessment program in place at the time of the accident. On July 3, 2013, the Atlanta Police Department Helicopter Unit implemented a flight risk assessment tool for use by unit flight crews. The tool assesses flight risk based on an evaluation of weather, pilot-in-command experience, tactical flight officer experience, type of call/response, and other factors. Based on a numerical value, the mission must be approved by the pilot-in-command (low risk value) up to the unit commander (high risk value). -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "According to the operator, the airline transport-rated pilot sent a text indicating that he was intending to depart on a scheduled repositioning flight from a helipad located behind the pilot's home to an airport located about 25 nautical miles southwest. Data recovered from a handheld GPS device showed that the helicopter lifted off from the helipad and began accelerating forward while turning right and maintaining a relatively constant altitude. During the 27 seconds of recorded flight that followed, the helicopter's right turn rate increased, shortly decreased slightly, and then significantly increased again as the helicopter began to descend. The helicopter subsequently impacted trees and terrain.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the weather reporting stations closest to the accident site and at the destination airport generally reported that visual meteorological conditions prevailed, the presence of calm wind, near-coincident temperatures and dew points, and the clear night sky favored the formation of patch radiation fog and/or dew on the surface. Visible satellite imagery captured about 1 hour after the accident depicted a band of low stratiform clouds or fog/mist over the accident site and along the adjacent river valley. Additionally, several witnesses near the helipad reported that the lighting and weather conditions about the time of the accident were \"dark\" and \"foggy.\" Postaccident examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures of the airframe or engine that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped to operate in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC). Although the airline transport-rated pilot possessed airplane and helicopter instrument ratings, his most recent instrument proficiency check was completed about 8 months before the accident in an airplane, not a helicopter, and no evidence was found indicating that he was current or proficient in operating a helicopter in IMC. Regardless, the fog should have been an indication to the pilot that IMC existed, and he should not have decided to operate the helicopter in such conditions. The flight profile and the presence of radiation fog during dark night conditions, which would have obscured visual references such as the trees, are consistent with the pilot having experienced spatial disorientation, specifically a vestibular illusion known as the \"graveyard spiral.\"",
    "FactualNarrative": "Spatial Disorientation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Airplane Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-3), \"Night flying is very different from day flying and demands more attention of the pilot. The most noticeable difference is the limited availability of outside visual references. Therefore, flight instruments should be used to a greater degree.… Generally, at night it is difficult to see clouds and restrictions to visibility, particularly on dark nights or under overcast. The pilot flying under VFR must exercise caution to avoid flying into clouds or a layer of fog.\" The handbook described some hazards associated with flying in airplanes under VFR when visual references, such as the ground or horizon, are obscured. \"The vestibular sense (motion sensing by the inner ear) in particular tends to confuse the pilot. Because of inertia, the sensory areas of the inner ear cannot detect slight changes in the attitude of the airplane, nor can they accurately sense attitude changes that occur at a uniform rate over a period of time. On the other hand, false sensations are often generated; leading the pilot to believe the attitude of the airplane has changed when in fact, it has not. These false sensations result in the pilot experiencing spatial disorientation.\" According to the FAA Instrument Flying Handbook (FAA-H-8083-15), a rapid acceleration \"...stimulates the otolith organs in the same way as tilting the head backwards. This action creates the somatogravic illusion of being in a nose-up attitude, especially in situations without good visual references. The disoriented pilot may push the aircraft into a nose-low or dive attitude.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA publication Medical Facts for Pilots (AM-400-03/1), described several vestibular illusions associated with the operation of aircraft in low visibility conditions. Somatogyral illusions, those involving the semicircular canals of the vestibular system, were generally placed into one of four categories, one of which was the \"graveyard spiral.\" According to the text, the graveyard spiral, \"…is associated with a return to level flight following an intentional or unintentional prolonged bank turn. For example, a pilot who enters a banking turn to the left will initially have a sensation of a turn in the same direction. If the left turn continues (~20 seconds or more), the pilot will experience the sensation that the airplane is no longer turning to the left. At this point, if the pilot attempts to level the wings this action will produce a sensation that the airplane is turning and banking in the opposite direction (to the right). If the pilot believes the illusion of a right turn (which can be very compelling), he/she will reenter the original left turn in an attempt to counteract the sensation of a right turn. Unfortunately, while this is happening, the airplane is still turning to the left and losing altitude. Pulling the control yoke/stick and applying power while turning would not be a good idea–because it would only make the left turn tighter. If the pilot fails to recognize the illusion and does not level the wings, the airplane will continue turning left and losing altitude until it impacts the ground.\" - According to the Canadian Civil Aircraft Register, the accident helicopter was manufactured in 1991, and imported to Canada in 2010. The helicopter was equipped with a three-blade main rotor system and two Rolls Royce/Allison 250-C20F engines each rated at 420 horse power. According to the operator, the helicopter was not equipped for operation in instrument meteorological conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter's most recent annual inspection was completed on February 21, 2012, and at that time the helicopter had accumulated 7,534 total flight hours. According to the maintenance journey log, which was recovered from the wreckage, the helicopter had accumulated 7,556 total flight hours prior to the accident flight. A log entry made by the accident pilot on the date of the accident noted compliance with Airworthiness Directives 2001-26-55 (tail rotor blade inspection) and 2011-22-05 (tail rotor control rod bearing play inspection) and that no discrepancies were found during either inspection. - The departure heliport, 4PN5, was located about 1,000 feet southwest of the accident site. The heliport was comprised of a 65-foot square turf and gravel helipad, which was located in the backyard of the pilot's home at an estimated elevation of 400 feet. A rural neighborhood surrounded the heliport to the north, east, and south. The west bank of the Delaware River was located about 1/2-mile east of the heliport, at an elevation of 120 feet. - The helicopter was not equipped with any flight data recording devices, nor was it required to be; however, a hand-held global positioning system (GPS) receiver was recovered from the wreckage, and found to contain data pertaining to the accident flight. The initial data point was recorded at 0634, at the 4PN5 helipad. The helicopter's position began tracking northeast at 0635:59, at a GPS altitude of 442 feet. Over the next 27 seconds, the helicopter began to accelerate to about 85 knots ground speed, while turning to the right and maintaining a relatively constant altitude, within about 50 feet of the helicopter's initial recorded altitude as it began to accelerate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter maintained a consistent right-turning track for the entirety of the flight. Between 0636:09 and 0636:17, the calculated turn rate of the helicopter increased from about 3 degrees per second to about 18 degrees per second. Over the next 7 seconds, the turn rate decreased to about 14 degrees per second. The calculated turn rate between the final two recorded GPS positions increased again to about 31 degrees per second. Over the final 5 seconds recorded for the flight, the helicopter descended from a GPS altitude of 503 feet to 455 feet, which corresponded to an approximate 575-foot per minute average descent rate for that portion of the flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe initial impact point (IIP) was located about 300 feet northwest of the helicopter's final GPS recorded position. - On October 17, 2012, at 0636 eastern daylight time, an Aerospatiale AS 355 F2, Canadian registration C-FXGM, operated by Catalyst Aviation LLC, was substantially damaged when it impacted trees and terrain shortly after takeoff from Brigham Heliport (4PN5), Erwinna, Pennsylvania. The airline transport pilot was fatally injured. Dark night instrument meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The positioning flight, destined for Wings Field (LOM), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the pilot was scheduled to position the helicopter from 4PN5 to LOM, where after fueling; passengers would embark for a local pipeline patrol flight. The pilot reported to the operator his intent to depart from the heliport via a text message that was received at 0637. No further communications were received from the pilot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses reported hearing the helicopter as it overflew their rural neighborhood about the time of the accident. The witnesses reported that it was not unusual to observe the accident pilot operating helicopters from the heliport in his backyard, particularly during his prior years of service as a State Police pilot. The witnesses reported that on the morning of the accident flight, the helicopter they heard sounded \"abnormal.\" The witnesses generally described that the helicopter was low, loud, and that it sounded different than previous times they had heard helicopters departing the heliport. One witness, who happened to be looking out a window at time of the accident, observed two lights that she presumed to be the accident helicopter as they descended into trees behind her home.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAfter hearing the sounds of impact, some of the witnesses responded to the accident scene and attempted to render assistance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses who lived in the vicinity of the accident site were interviewed separately shortly after the accident. Each was asked to describe the weather and lighting conditions that prevailed at the time. The witnesses consistently described the weather as \"foggy,\" with some stating that it was \"very\" or \"extremely\" foggy. One witness described the fog as being very dense, like \"pea soup,\" while another estimated the visibility to be about 1/8th-mile. The witnesses also consistently described the lighting conditions as \"dark\" or \"very dark\". Another witness who lived about 1 mile north of the accident site described the weather conditions about 1 hour after the accident as cloudy with no fog. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot by the Office of the Coroner, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The listed cause of death was \"multiple injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicological testing on the pilot. No cyanide, ethanol, or drugs were detected in the samples submitted for testing. The samples submitted for carbon monoxide testing were deemed \"unsuitable for analysis.\" - The National Weather Service (NWS) Area Forecast applicable to the area surrounding the accident site, which was issued at 0445, predicted broken to scattered ceiling with visual meteorological conditions generally prevailing around the region. No AIRMETS or SIGMETS were current for the area of the accident flight at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite -14 infrared satellite image for 0645 depicted a band of mid-level stratiform-type clouds over the accident site with a radiative cloud top temperature that corresponded to cloud tops near 16,000 feet. The first available visible satellite image at 0732 showed a band of low stratiform clouds or fog/mist over the accident site, and along the Delaware River Valley.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe weather conditions at Doylestown Airport (DYL), Doylestown, Pennsylvania, located about 11 nautical miles south of the accident site, at 0654, included calm winds, clear skies below 12,000 feet, 10 statute miles visibility, a temperature and dew point of 1 degree C, and an altimeter setting of 29.99 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe weather conditions at LOM, located about 25 nautical miles southwest of the accident site, at 0635, included calm winds, clear skies below 12,000 feet, 5 statute miles visibility, a temperature and dew point of 3 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.97 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the U.S. Naval Observatory, on October 9, 2012, the beginning of civil twilight occurred at 0648 and sunrise occurred at 0716. The moon set at 1902 on the preceding evening, and did not rise again until 0949 on the morning of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses who lived in the vicinity of the accident site were interviewed separately shortly after the accident. Each was asked to describe the weather and lighting conditions that prevailed at the time. The witnesses consistently described the weather as \"foggy,\" with some stating that it was \"very\" or \"extremely\" foggy. One witness described the fog as being very dense, like \"pea soup,\" while another estimated the visibility to be about 1/8th-mile. The witnesses also consistently described the lighting conditions as \"dark\" or \"very dark\". Another witness who lived about 1 mile north of the accident site described the weather conditions about 1 hour after the accident as cloudy with no fog.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the NWS, \"Radiation fog forms at night under clear skies with calm winds when heat absorbed by the earth's surface during the day is radiated into space. As the earth's surface continues to cool, provided a deep enough layer of moist air is present near the ground, the humidity will reach 100% and fog will form. Radiation fog varies in depth from 3 feet to about 1,000 feet and is always found at ground level and usually remains stationary. This type of fog can reduce visibility to near zero at times and make driving very hazardous.\" Radiation fog is most common under high pressure systems and ridges during the fall and winter months, where clear skies and light winds prevail. - The pilot, age 52, held an airline transport pilot certificate with a rating for rotorcraft-helicopter, as well as a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single and multi-engine land, and instrument airplane. He additionally held a flight instructor certificate with ratings for airplane single engine, rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument helicopter. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second class medical certificate was issued on July 23, 2012 with the limitation, \"must wear corrective lenses.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a résumé provided to the operator by the pilot, he was previously employed as a Trooper with the Pennsylvania State Police. Between 1993 and 1996, he was employed as a pilot operating airplanes, after which he operated helicopters through 2004. The pilot was employed as the helicopter unit supervisor between 2004 and 2011. During that period the pilot reported several other part time jobs with other helicopter operators. According to the pilot's personal flight log, his final flight as a State Police pilot was logged on January 5, 2011. When asked to describe the pilot, the operator stated that she was very confident in his abilities, judgment, and training; stating that he was a \"go-to\" person, and that he was the best representative of the company. She further described the pilot as very safety conscious, and related an anecdote about an instance where the pilot had refused to depart on a daytime mission until a burnt-out position light had been replaced.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's personal flight log was recovered at the accident site, and reflected flights logged between November 2002 and October 9, 2012. The pilot's flight hours between October 9 and October 14 were recovered from the accident helicopter's maintenance journey log. According to the logs, the pilot had accumulated 7,106 total hours of flight experience, 4,599 hours of which were in helicopters. The pilot recorded about 100 hours of flight experience in the accident helicopter make and model.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAs of January 2011, the pilot had accumulated 593 total hours of flight experience at night, 228 hours of which were with the aid of night vision goggles. Between that time and the pilot's most recent flight log entry on October 9, 2012, he had logged an additional 4.1 hours of night flight experience, 2.9 hours of which were accumulated in the 90 days preceding the accident in the accident helicopter make and model.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator's records, the pilot's most recent FAR Part 135 recurrent check was completed on April 27, 2012. While a remark on the evaluation form noted, \"Inadvertent IMC tested &amp; passed,\" the proficiency check did not cover instrument operations. According to the pilot's personal flight records, his most recent instrument proficiency check was completed in an airplane on February 25, 2012. The pilot's most recent logged instrument flight experience in a helicopter included 0.3 hours of simulated instrument experience logged in June 2010, and 1.0 hour of simulated instrument experience logged June 2008. No evidence of any more recent instrument flight experience in helicopters or an instrument proficiency check in a helicopter was contained within the pilot's personal flight log or other records provided by the operator.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nActivities Preceding the Accident&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator entered into a lease agreement with the accident helicopter's owner for use of the helicopter while another of the operator's helicopters underwent repairs. The accident pilot subsequently retrieved the accident helicopter from the owner on October 7, and flew it from Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF), Buffalo, New York, to one of his homes in Binghamton, New York. After performing four local flights in the vicinity of Binghamton between October 9 and 12, the pilot positioned the helicopter to his home at 4PN5 on October 14. The operator last contacted the pilot via telephone on October 16 at 2000. At that time the pilot was at the local fire department, receiving training as a volunteer fireman.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the morning of the accident the pilot was scheduled to arrive at LOM about 0730 in preparation for the pipeline patrol flight that was to follow. - The accident site was located in a densely wooded area approximately 1,000 feet northeast of 4PN5. The IIP was identified by several damaged tree limbs about 75 feet above the ground, a height which was roughly the same as that of the departure heliport. A wreckage path approximately 300 feet long, oriented roughly 350 degrees magnetic, extended from the initial impact point to where the main wreckage came to rest against a tree. The main wreckage was oriented on a westerly heading, and was largely consumed by a post-impact fire.  Each of the three main rotor blades was accounted for at the accident scene, and all came to rest within 30 feet of the main wreckage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was subsequently recovered from the accident scene and examined in detail at an aircraft recovery facility.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tailboom had severed from the fuselage forward of the horizontal stabilizer, and was found along the wreckage path about 30 feet south of the main wreckage. The severed tail section consisted of the tailboom structure, left horizontal stabilizer, the inboard portion of the severed right horizontal stabilizer, the vertical stabilizer, and the tail rotor.  The forward end of the tailboom was crumpled with a leftward directionality. The examined fracture surfaces of the tailboom structure all exhibited signatures consistent with overstress failure. The right horizontal stabilizer was severed from the tailboom via a fracture that began at the inboard forward end of the horizontal stabilizer with an aft and upward directionality. Examination of the fracture surfaces revealed signatures consistent with overstress failure and wooden splinters lodged between the top skin and doubler of the right horizontal stabilizer. The left horizontal stabilizer remained mostly intact and attached to the tailboom, albeit with a slight downward bend and with a small section of the outboard trailing edge that was severed.  The vertical stabilizer suffered no major damage except for a large dent near the leading edge of the top portion of the vertical stabilizer.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing skids were recovered as an assembly.  Both forward and aft crosstubes did not exhibit severe bending.  The main fuselage attachment points remained on the crosstubes and did not exhibit significant movement or extreme rotation about the crosstubes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll three main rotor blades exhibited significant impact-related damage to their respective leading edges, consistent with the damage observed to the trees at the accident site. Each of the main rotor blades (identified as red, blue, and yellow) exhibited the majority of the impact signatures at their tip, mid span, and root, respectively. The portions of the blades outboard of each impact was displaced aft, toward each of the blades trailing edge. The Starflex arms each exhibited signatures consistent with tensile failure on their advancing sides and compressive failure on their trailing sides. The composite main rotor blade sleeves for the yellow blade had fractured and exhibited severe splintering consistent with a high energy impact. The sleeves for the red blade exhibited less severe fractures, while the blue blade sleeves were consumed by the post-impact fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor blades exhibited scuffing on the blade skin as well as damage to the blade tips. Several fractures that ruptured through the blade skin were observed on both blades, but the blades themselves remained whole. Both pitch links remained intact and attached to the blade and to the tail rotor gearbox. Continuity of the tail rotor drive and control systems were confirmed from the tail rotor to the tailboom-fuselage separation point; however continuity could not be confirmed forward of that point due to post-impact-related fire damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth engines were recovered from the wreckage and forwarded to the engine manufacturer for disassembly and detailed examination.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe number 1 engine displayed impact-related damage and thermal damage consistent with exposure to a post-impact fire. Both left and right compressor air discharge tubes displayed denting and impact damage along their lengths but remained properly seated within both the scroll and outer combustion case. Removal of the air tubes revealed dirt within both tubes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeparation of the compressor case halves revealed that the abradable material had melted and was generally consumed by post-impact fire. With the exception of the fire-exposure signatures, the compressor rotor blades and vanes were visually undamaged. Examination of the compressor impeller and shroud revealed that the shroud exhibited rotational scoring of an approximate two hundred degree arc from the knee area extending out to the exducer area with corresponding rub damage noted on the impeller blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe outer combustion case exhibited overall scratches with denting along the top of the dome area extending to the right shoulder area. Removal of the outer combustion case revealed dirt and vegetation debris in and around the basket area. The combustor liner was found in its normal position, visually normal in appearance with no unusual streaking; however, dirt adherence was noted on the inside of the liner.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth the gas producer and power turbine supports remained in position and other than external thermal exposure signatures were normal in appearance. Separation of supports revealed both turbine rotors in proper position with dirt and light residual oil noted throughout the gas path with dirt adhesion noted across vane and blade surfaces. The #4 nozzle exhibited rub contact in the blade path of the #3 wheel between the 10 and 12 o'clock positions from rotational contact with the #3 wheel outer rim. The blade path of the #4 wheel exhibited scoring between the 4 and 5 o'clock position from rotational contact with the #4 wheel outer rim knife seals.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe number 2 engine displayed impact-related damage and thermal damage consistent with exposure to a post-impact fire. Both left and right compressor air discharge tubes were recovered. Both displayed denting along their lengths and were discolored from fire exposure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeparation of the compressor case halves revealed the abradable material to have melted and to have been generally consumed by post-impact fire with hardened molten material also noted between vanes and between impeller blades. Other than fire exposure signatures and initiating corrosion the compressor rotor blades and vanes were visually undamaged. Examination of the compressor impeller and shroud revealed the shroud to exhibit light rub from the knee area extending out to the toe area with corresponding rub damage noted on the impeller blades.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe outer combustion case exhibited denting across the top forward of the dome area extending out and including the right arm area. The exterior bottom of the outer combustion case had area of molten material adhesion including the burner drain. The combustor liner was found in its normal position, visually normal in appearance with no unusual streaking.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth the gas producer and power turbine supports remained in position and other than external thermal exposure signatures were normal in appearance. Separation of the turbine supports revealed both turbine rotors in proper position with areas of dirt noted throughout the gas path. Dirt and external debris was noted positioned between the #1 nozzle rim and the gas producer support. The #1 nozzle exhibited debris ingestion-type impact damage to the trailing edge of three vanes .The #2 turbine nozzle was visibly normal in appearance and undamaged with dirt adhesion noted on vane surfaces. The #1 wheel displayed dirt adhesion to blade surfaces with the #2 wheel displaying an ashen coating. The #3 nozzle displayed no visible damage but did exhibit dirt adhesion to vane surfaces of an approximate 30% arc of the vane surfaces and a purple coating across surfaces similar to color noted on area vegetation at the accident site. The #4 nozzle displayed dirt adhesion to vane surfaces along with a purple coating. Rotational scoring was noted in the blade path of the #3 wheel between the 4 and 8 o'clock positions from rotational contact with the #3 wheel outer rim. The blade path of the #4 wheel revealed circumferential scoring resulting from rotational contact with the #4 wheel outer rim knife seals. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "According to track data recovered from a handheld GPS receiver found in the wreckage, the helicopter was on the final leg of a cross-country flight that had originated earlier in the day. According to fueling documentation, the helicopter was refueled, and the flight departed and proceeded on a southeast course toward the intended destination. According to the plotted GPS data, while enroute, about 600 feet above ground level (agl), the helicopter entered a descending left turn to an east-northeast course. About 30 seconds later, after descending about 100 feet, the helicopter entered a climb while on a northeast heading. During the climb, the helicopter's groundspeed decreased from 73 knots to 27 knots. The final GPS data point, recorded about 1 minute after the initial turn from the intended course, showed the helicopter about 800 feet agl at 27 knots groundspeed and about 0.2 mile north-northwest of the accident site. The helicopter wreckage was located in a sparsely populated area with hilly terrain. The debris path was orientated on a south-southeast heading, and the length and distribution of the debris path were consistent with the helicopter impacting rising terrain at cruise speed.  Postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of a preimpact failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident review of meteorological data established that marginal visual flight rules conditions likely existed in the vicinity of the accident site at the time of the accident. The weather data supported increasing low-level cloud development and scattered light rain showers. No strong outflow winds or severe storm signatures were associated with the observed rain showers. The accident flight was conducted in dark nighttime conditions with minimal illumination from ground light sources. The helicopter's flight path during the last minute of GPS data was consistent with the pilot becoming spatially disoriented due to the lack of a discernible horizon that he could use to maintain control of the helicopter. Although the helicopter was equipped with basic attitude instrumentation and avionics, it was not certified for flight under instrument flight rules (IFR). Additionally, although the pilot held an instrument rating for helicopters, his IFR currency could not be verified from available logbook data.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA correspondence, about 5 months before the accident, the FAA had notified the pilot that he was ineligible to hold any class of medical certificate because of his multiple alcohol-related offenses. Although he had been advised multiple times of his ineligibility to hold a medical certificate, flight documentation established that the pilot continued to exercise the privileges of his commercial and flight instructor certificates. Toxicological test results for the pilot were negative for carbon monoxide, cyanide, ethanol, and all drugs and medications.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter operator reported that the accident occurred during an instructional flight; however, a review of available evidence did not support that the front-seat passenger was receiving flight instruction on the accident flight. According to FAA records, the front-seat passenger had never applied for a student pilot certificate or an aviation medical certificate. Additionally, a pilot logbook was not recovered during the investigation for the front-seat passenger. According to a business associate of both passengers, the front-seat passenger had coordinated the flight to attend a business appointment. According to photographs recovered from the front-seat passenger's mobile phone, on earlier flight legs, he had been seated in the left front seat. According to the helicopter manufacturer, the flying pilot typically would be seated in the right front seat, especially during initial flight instruction. Additionally, a review of the front-seat passenger's mobile phone established that he had been exchanging text messages with a business colleague in the minutes preceding the accident. Specifically, the final outgoing text message was sent about 26 seconds before the helicopter deviated from the direct course toward the intended destination. Therefore, it is unlikely that the passenger was operating the helicopter at the time of the accident.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The two passengers were employed by Venture Energy Services. According to a company representative, the purpose of the flight was to fly to Midland, Texas, so that the passengers could interview a potential employee. Venture Energy Services owned and operated their own airplane for business flights; however, on the day of the accident, the airplane was not available because it was undergoing maintenance. The owner of the company had other personal aircraft that were often used for business flights; however, those aircraft typically were not made available unless the owner was also going on the business flight. As such, one of the passengers had arranged the accident flight through Veracity Aviation LLC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the owner of Veracity Aviation LLC, the passenger who arranged the accident flight was an established customer who had previously obtained helicopter flight instruction. According to invoices, dated between May 2012 and September 2012, the passenger had completed 5 instructional flights in a Robinson R44 helicopter, totaling 7 hours of flight time. The owner of Veracity Aviation LLC reported that the passenger did not have a logbook in which the dual instruction had been recorded. Additionally, the passenger had reportedly paid for two of his friends to have introductory helicopter flights.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA records, the passenger who arranged the accident flight had never applied for a student pilot certificate or an aviation medical certificate. A pilot logbook was not recovered during the investigation for the passenger. Beyond the 5 invoices for the instructional flights with Veracity Aviation LLC, no additional information was recovered during the investigation that indicated the passenger had been actively pursuing flight instruction.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to fueling documentation for the accident flight, the passenger who arranged the flight had used his company credit card, issued by Venture Energy Services, to purchase fuel at Midland International Airport (MAF) and Gillespie County Airport (T82). According to the owner of Veracity Aviation LLC, the advertised rental rate for the accident helicopter included the cost of fuel. He further stated that he did not know why the passenger would have paid for the fuel, but that he would have credited any fuel that had been purchased by the passenger. According to a Venture Energy Services company representative, the passenger who had arranged the flight told him that Veracity Aviation LLC had discounted the hourly rental rate for the helicopter if they agreed to purchase any required fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe passenger who had arranged the accident flight had a mobile phone that contained several text messages and photos which were aviation related. On September 22, 2012, the passenger and the owner of Veracity Aviation LLC discussed having a \"charter\" the following morning. The passenger noted that he had an investor in town that wanted to go on an aerial observation flight to \"count his exotic animals.\" On September 23, 2012, the passenger sent a text message to his investor that read \"We're getting the doors off and fueling up. I'll text you when we take off and I'll pick you up by the tennis court by the lodge.\" The passenger's mobile phone contained several photos that were taken on September 23, 2012, during a helicopter flight. Two of the photos established that the photographer was seated in the forward right seat of a Robinson R44 helicopter. The photographer's feet were flat on the floor; they were not positioned on the helicopter's anti-torque pedals. According to invoices provided by Veracity Aviation LLC, the flight on September 23, 2012, was invoiced as an instructional flight and the owner of Veracity Aviation LLC was listed as the flight instructor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn October 9, 2012, the passenger and the owner of Veracity Aviation LLC exchanged multiple text messages about another potential flight; however, the discussed flight was subsequently canceled by the passenger due to a scheduling change.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the day of the accident, the passenger's mobile phone had several text messages that were associated with the accident flight. At 1016:47, the passenger mistakenly sent a text message to an unintended recipient that read \"Also I need your weight??? Lol its for fuel purposes.\" At 1034:41, the pilot sent the passenger a text message concerning a temporary airspace flight restriction (TFR), which ultimately was determined not to be active on the day of the accident. Between 1049:32 and 1050:28, the passenger and pilot exchanged 3 text messages about meeting at the airport, and the final message from the passenger read \"it will be me and 187 lbs person.\" After landing in Midland, Texas, at 1529:08, the pilot sent a business related message that indicated that they had landed at Midland. At 1859:38, the pilot sent a text message that read \"In helicopter headed back to Seguin from Midland I'm about 1 hr out.\" Between 1951:00 and 1956:24, the pilot and a colleague exchanged 5 text messages concerning a business related topic. The final 2 text messages of that conversation were sent by the passenger at 1956:17 and 1956:24. According to the recovered GPS track data, which was obtained from another handheld device, the passenger's final outgoing text message was sent about 26 seconds before the helicopter began the left descending turn, and 1 minute 25 seconds before the final recorded GPS data point.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe passenger's mobile phone also contained several photos that were taken at various times on the day of the accident. At 1449:33, while the helicopter was en route to Midland, Texas, a photo was taken looking forward from the front left seat of a Robinson R44 helicopter. At 1503:47, shortly after the helicopter had landed at Midland, Texas, a photo was taken of an airport ramp, looking forward from the front left seat of the helicopter. At 1818:17, while the helicopter was en route to Fredericksburg, Texas, a photo was taken looking forward from the front left seat of the helicopter. At 1926:36, another photo was taken looking forward from the front left seat of the helicopter. At 1926:52, another photo was taken from the front left seat of the helicopter, and depicted the left edge of the instrument panel, the left cockpit floor, and the left cyclic control stick. In the photo the photographer's feet were positioned on the helicopter's anti-torque pedals, which were in a neutral position. Although the photo did not capture entire length of left cyclic control stick, there were no hands visible on the upper 1/3 of the control stick. At 1935:35 and 1935:44, two photos were taken of a dark airport ramp with runway and taxiway lights illuminated. At 1940:05 and 1940:08, two photos were taken while the photographer stood outside the helicopter. The photos were focused on the left side of a Robinson R44 helicopter that was sitting on an airport ramp. Although the horizon was still discernible in the photos, the ramp area was already dark. The helicopter's red beacon lights were illuminated and the main rotor was rotating at the time of the photographs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter manufacturer, the flying-pilot typically would be seated in the right cockpit position. Additionally, during flight instruction, the pilot-receiving-instruction typically would be seated in the right cockpit position and the flight instructor in the left cockpit position. - The accident aircraft was Robinson Helicopter Company model R44 II, serial number (s/n) 12517. The helicopter was a four-seat, single-engine helicopter that was equipped with a skid type landing gear. The FAA type certificate required one flight crew member (pilot) and permitted operations under day or night visual flight rules (VFR). Although the cockpit was equipped with flight attitude instrumentation and avionics, the accident helicopter was not certified for flight under instrument flight rules. The helicopter was equipped with dual cyclic controls and anti-torque pedals located at both the right and left cockpit positions. The helicopter was powered by a 245-horsepower Lycoming model IO-540-AE1A5, s/n L-33161-48E, reciprocating engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was issued a Standard Airworthiness Certificate on October 14, 2008. A review of the maintenance records revealed that the helicopter had undergone an annual inspection on October 3, 2012, at 993.5 hours total time. At the time of the accident, the airframe and engine had accumulated 1,003.0 hours in service. The helicopter had accumulated 9.5 hours since the last maintenance inspection. A review of maintenance documentation did not reveal any unresolved airworthiness issues.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to maintenance documentation, the accident helicopter had a basic empty weight of 1,530.5 pounds (lbs), a center-of-gravity location of 106.9-inches, and a useful load of 969.5 lbs. According to autopsy data, the pilot weighed 200 lbs, the front seat passenger weighed 325 lbs, and the rear seat passenger weighed 200 lbs. According to the Robinson R44 II Pilot Operating Handbook, the seats were limited to 300 lbs. According to GPS flight data and refueling documentation, the accident helicopter had about 36 gallons of fuel onboard when it departed on the accident flight. The additional personal property and cargo found onboard the helicopter weighed about 30 lbs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to postaccident weight and balance calculations, the helicopter weighed about 2,501.5 lbs and had a center-of-gravity location of 91.85-inches when it departed on the accident flight. As such, at the time of departure, the helicopter likely exceeded the maximum gross weight limitation of 2,500 lbs and had a center-of-gravity located forward of the allowable limit. - On October 11, 2012, about 1958 central daylight time, a Robinson Helicopter Company model R44 II, N474FA, was substantially damaged when it collided with terrain during cruise flight near Blanco, Texas. The pilot and two passengers were fatally injured. The helicopter was operated by Veracity Aviation LLC, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 without a flight plan. Night visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight that departed Gillespie County Airport (T82), Fredericksburg, Texas, about 1942, and was en route to Huber Airpark Civic Club LLC Airport (E70), Seguin, Texas.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to recovered GPS data, the roundtrip cross-country flight, from the operator's home base at E70, located in Seguin, Texas, to Midland International Airport (MAF), in Midland, Texas, originally departed at 1241. The helicopter landed at MAF about 1503. According to fueling documentation, the accident helicopter was fueled with 37.7 gallons of 100 low-lead aviation fuel before the return flight. The return flight departed MAF at 1735 and landed at T82 to refuel about 1936.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere were no witnesses to the helicopter arriving at T82 nor while it was being refueled at the self-serve fueling stations. According to fueling documentation, at 1936, the accident helicopter was fueled with 15.92 gallons of 100 low-lead aviation fuel.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to GPS data, the flight departed T82 at 1942. A witness, who was also a helicopter pilot, reported seeing a Robinson R44 helicopter depart toward the southeast; however, due to the dark night conditions he was unable to discern the helicopter's registration number or paint color. He noted that the helicopter had departed from the self-service fueling station near the main airport building.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe plotted GPS data indicated that the flight proceeded on a southeast course toward the intended destination (E70). According to the data, the helicopter maintained an average ground speed of about 80 knots while in cruise flight. At 1956:50 (hhmm:ss), the helicopter entered a descending left turn from a southeast course to an east-northeast course. The helicopter was at 2,517 feet GPS altitude, about 610 feet above ground level, and had a ground speed of 72 knots when it entered the descending left turn. At 1957:19, the recorded GPS altitude was 2,396 feet, about 500 feet above ground level, and the helicopter's ground speed was 73 knots. The helicopter then began to climb on a northeast heading. The GPS data indicated that, during the climb, the helicopter's ground speed decreased from 73 knots to 27 knots. The final GPS data point associated with the accident flight was recorded at 1957:49 and a GPS altitude of 2,643 feet, about 800 feet above the terrain, with a ground speed of 27 knots. The final data point was located about 0.2 miles north-northwest of the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2006, the United States Air Force Rescue Coordination Center (AFRCC), located at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, received a 406 MHz emergency locator transmitter (ELT) signal assigned to the accident helicopter. About 18 minutes later, the AFRCC was received their first of several triangulated positions for the active ELT signal. The accident site was subsequently located, with the assistance of airborne and ground units, at 0824 the morning following the accident. The wreckage was located in a sparsely populated area that was comprised of hilly terrain. - On October 13, 2012, an autopsy was performed on the pilot by the Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office, located in San Antonio, Texas. The cause of death was attributed to multiple blunt-force injuries that were sustained during the accident. The FAA's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology tests on samples obtained during the autopsy. The toxicological test results were negative for carbon monoxide, cyanide, ethanol, and all drugs and medications. - At 1900, a National Weather Service (NWS) Surface Analysis Chart depicted a low pressure system over eastern Kansas with a cold front extending southwest through Kansas and into the Oklahoma panhandle. A warm front extended southeast from the low into eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas. A high pressure region was located over Alabama. The resultant pressure gradient resulted in a general southeasterly wind flow that supported a warm moist air mass originating from the Gulf of Mexico.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 2000, the NWS Weather Depiction Chart depicted a small area of marginal visual flight rule (MVFR) conditions in the vicinity of the accident site. The observed conditions near the accident site supported increasing low-level cloud development and scattered rain showers and thunderstorms.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of weather radar data revealed that, between 1956 and 1958, the helicopter's recorded GPS flight track bordered an area of very light intensity echoes. During the same time period, there was an area of light radar echoes that had developed immediately south of the accident site. The radar images revealed the potential of lower clouds and restricted visibility with light rain. Following the accident, several small areas of moderate-to-strong rain showers developed about 2 miles south of the accident site. These rain showers moved northward at 10 knots with time. No strong outflow winds or severe storm signatures were associated with the observed rain showers.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest weather observing station was located at the Gillespie County Airport (T82), Fredericksburg, Texas, about 22 miles northwest of the accident site. At 1955, the automated surface observing system reported: wind 140 degrees magnetic at 5 knots, visibility 10 miles, scattered clouds at 1,900 feet above ground level, temperature 23 degrees Celsius, dew point 22 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.10 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe United States Naval Observatory reported that the sunset and end of civil twilight at the departure airport was at 1908 and 1932, respectively. At the time of the accident, the moon was more than 15 degrees below the horizon and, as such, did not provide any illumination. Additionally, the accident site was located in a sparsely populated area with minimal illumination from ground light sources. As such, dark nighttime conditions existed at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner of the property where the accident occurred reported that it had been overcast a majority of the day with a noticeable lower cloud layer at the time of the accident. Between 1910 and 1915, as he was driving east on Farm-To-Market Road, approximately 2 to 4 miles west of his property and approximately 4 miles north of the accident site, he observed a dark cloud to the south and southeast, which he thought was associated with an area of rain. He did not recall seeing any lightning at that time. After arriving home, about 2030, it began to rain lightly to the point where it was necessary to close his house windows. - According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot, age 35, held a commercial pilot certificate with helicopter and instrument helicopter ratings. He also held a flight instructor certificate with helicopter and instrument helicopter ratings. His last aviation medical examination was completed on March 31, 2011, when he was issued a second-class medical certificate without limitations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's flight history was reconstructed using a partially completed pilot logbook, a spreadsheet flight history that was provided by the pilot's employer, and GPS flight data that was recorded on the day of the accident. A review of the pilot's flight logbook revealed that his last recorded flight was completed on May 24, 2012. At that time, he had accumulated 1,410.9 hours total flight experience, of which 1,348.1 hours were listed as pilot-in-command. All of his logged flight time had been completed in helicopters. He had accumulated 63.6 hours in simulated instrument conditions and 109.5 hours at night. According the spreadsheet flight history, the pilot had flown an additional 111.7 hours since his final logbook entry. According to recovered GPS data, the pilot had flown 4.7 hours on the day of the accident. The pilot's total flight experience was estimated to be about 1,527.3 hours, of which 543.7 hours were completed in the same make/model as the accident helicopter. He had accumulated 1,464.5 hours as pilot-in-command and 644.4 hours as a flight instructor. He had accumulated 422.6 hours during the past year, 149.4 hours during the prior 6 months, 95.0 hours during previous 90 days, and 27.4 hours in the last 30 days. The pilot had flown 5.6 hours within the 24 hour period before the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's employer, Veracity Aviation LLC, provided flight instruction, local air tours, on-demand air taxi services, and external load operations. The accident pilot was employed as a flight instructor and assistant chief pilot for their 14 CFR Part 141 flight school. According to FAA documentation, on November 7, 2011, the pilot demonstrated the skill and knowledge to operate as pilot-in-command for external-load helicopter operations. On November 8, 2011, the pilot passed a FAA regulatory checkride to become an assistant chief pilot for the 14 CFR Part 141 flight school. The pilot was not authorized to act as pilot-in-command for Veracity Aviation LLC's on-demand air taxi service under 14 CFR Part 135.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn March 15, 2012, the pilot received a letter from the FAA Aerospace Medical Certification Division informing him that he was not eligible to hold any class of medical certificate because of multiple alcohol related offenses. The pilot had two arrests that were associated with driving while intoxicated (DWI). The first arrest, dated October 16, 2004, resulted in a DWI conviction. The second arrest, dated November 18, 2011, was not prosecuted by the State of Texas as a DWI offense. On March 19, 2012, the pilot replied to the FAA letter, stating that he intended to work with the FAA to regain his eligibility to hold a medical certificate. The pilot also wrote that he had included his current medical certificate with the correspondence; however, FAA documentation indicated that the pilot had not included his medical certificate with his response. On March 27, 2012, the FAA replied to the pilot in the form of another letter that identified the specific regulations by which his eligibility to hold a medical had been revoked. The FAA response also detailed what documentation was required to be sent to the Aerospace Medical Certification Division for additional review before his eligibility could be reconsidered. On June 25, 2012, the pilot replied to the FAA in the form of another letter in which he described the circumstances of both alcohol related driving arrests. He wrote that he continued to provide \"ground instruction\" to his former students. Additionally, the pilot wrote that the State of Texas had declined to prosecute the November 2011 arrest for the charge of driving while intoxicated; however, he had pleaded not-guilty to the charges of speeding and being in possession of an open alcoholic beverage while operating a motor vehicle. On October 9, 2012, the FAA sent another letter to the pilot that reiterated his ineligibility to hold a medical certificate until all of the previously requested documentation had been received and reviewed by the Aerospace Medical Certification Division. (The pilot had not received the latest correspondence from the FAA Aerospace Medical Certification Division when the accident occurred)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe owner of Veracity Aviation LLC told the NTSB investigator that although he knew of the pilot's November 2011 arrest, he was unaware that the FAA had revoked his medical certificate. Additionally, he was unaware that the pilot had been working with the FAA to reestablish his eligibility to hold a medical certificate. According to flight documentation provided by Veracity Aviation LLC and the pilot's personal logbook, the pilot had accumulated 218.1 hours since March 15, 2012, when he received the initial letter from the FAA Aerospace Medical Certification Division notifying him of his ineligibility to hold a medical certificate. Additionally, the flight records indicated that the pilot continued to act as pilot-in-command and as a flight instructor during the same time period. (Federal regulation 14 CFR Part 61.23 required a flight instructor to hold at least a third-class medical certificate if they acted as the pilot-in-command of any instructional flight) - The helicopter wreckage was located in a sparsely populated area that was comprised of hilly terrain. The initial point-of-impact was identified by recently disturbed terrain near the summit of a hill. A wreckage debris path originated from the initial point-of-impact and consisted of fragmented airframe and flight control components. The debris path was orientated on a south-southeast heading. Portions of both landing gear skids were located between the initial point-of-impact and the main wreckage. The main wreckage was located about 160 feet from the initial point-of-impact. The engine, which had separated from the airframe, was located about 300 feet from the initial point-of-impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident investigation confirmed that all airframe structural components were located at the accident site. A majority of the airframe and flight control systems were fragmented during the impact sequence. There was no evidence of an inflight or postimpact fire. Flight control continuity could not be established due to multiple separations; however, all observed separations were consistent with overstress fractures. The hydraulic control servos moved freely when manipulated by hand. Examination of the four V-belts did not reveal any preimpact separations. The entire circumference of the forward face of the upper sheave exhibited scoring. Additionally, an upper fuselage frame tube exhibited scoring adjacent to the forward face of the upper sheave in the direction of sheave rotation. The observed scoring was consistent with the engine operating at the time of impact. The main rotor and tail rotor drive systems exhibited impact damage and several overstress separations. The main rotor hub had separated from the upper portion of the mast; however, the main rotor blades remained attached to their respective blade grips. The main rotor blades exhibited spanwise bending, fractures, and delamination consistent with ground impact. The main rotor gear box rotated freely by hand without any anomalies. The tail rotor hub remained attached to the tail rotor gearbox output shaft. The tail rotor blades remained attached their respective blade grips. One tail rotor blade exhibited spanwise bending and was fractured near the tip. Both tail rotor blades exhibited chordwise scratches. The tail rotor gear box rotated freely by hand without any anomalies. Both fuel tanks had been damaged during impact and did not contain any recoverable fuel. There were numerous separations within the fuel system; however, all observed separations were consistent with overstress fractures. The fuel selector valve was found in the \"ON\" position. The airframe examination did not reveal any evidence of a preimpact failure or malfunction of the helicopter structure, drive train, flight controls, hydraulic system, fuel system, and main and tail rotor systems that would have precluded normal operation. All observed airframe fractures were consistent with overload forces that were encountered during the impact sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine had separated from the helicopter airframe during the impact sequence. The left magneto, engine-driven fuel pump, and oil filter had separated from the engine. Internal engine and valve train continuity was confirmed as the engine crankshaft was rotated. Compression and suction were noted on all cylinders in conjunction with crankshaft rotation. The upper spark plugs were removed and exhibited features consistent with normal engine operation. A borescope inspection of the cylinders revealed no evidence of foreign object ingestion or detonation. The ignition harness and both magnetos exhibited impact damage that precluded a functional test of the ignition system. The fuel injection servo, induction system, and exhaust were not obstructed. Fluid consistent with the appearance and odor of 100 low-lead aviation fuel was observed in trace amounts at the fuel flow divider, engine-driven fuel pump, and the fuel injection servo filter screen. The right side of the oil cooler exhibited numerous impact marks adjacent to the starter ring gear. The left side cooling panels, adjacent to the starter ring gear, also exhibited scuff marks. The postaccident examination revealed no evidence of preimpact mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal engine operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFollowing the accident, a fuel sample was collected from the self-service fueling station that was used to fuel the accident helicopter before the accident flight. The fuel sample was blue in color, consistent with 100 low-lead aviation fuel. Additionally, the fuel sample did not contain any particulate or water contamination. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "A witness, who was performing maintenance on a broadcast tower, observed a helicopter operating about 1/2 mile to the east, flying toward the broadcast tower. When the helicopter was about 60 feet from the tower, it banked to the left, away from the tower, and subsequently struck the number 4 guy-wire on the south side of the broadcast tower. After the helicopter struck the wire, it veered back to the right and descended to the ground. Postaccident examination of the helicopter, engine, and related systems revealed no anomalies that would have precluded normal operation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn October 10, 2012, approximately 1155 central daylight time, a Bell 206B helicopter, N333DR, was substantially damaged when it impacted a guy-wire on a broadcast tower and then terrain, near Crowley, Louisiana. The private pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to Pintail Lodge Inc., and operated by a private individual under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight, which operated without a flight plan. The personal flight originated from Broussard, Louisiana, approximately 1135, and was en route to Beaumont, Texas.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a witness performing maintenance on the broadcast tower, he observed the helicopter ½ mile to the east, flying towards the tower. When the helicopter was approximately 60 feet from the broadcast tower, the helicopter banked to the left, as if to avoid hitting the tower and subsequently struck the number 4 guy-wire on the south side of the tower. After the helicopter struck the wire, the helicopter veered back to the right and descended to the ground. The witness did not observe or hear anything abnormal with the helicopter prior to the impact with the wire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 66, held a private pilot certificate with airplane single and multiengine airplane, rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument airplane ratings. He was issued a third class airman medical certificate on August 2, 2011. The certificate contained the limitation “Must have available glasses for near vision.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot’s flight logbook was not located. According to his last medical certificate application, the pilot reported 3,200 total flight hours; 30 of which had been logged in the previous six months. The date of the pilot’s last flight review, experience in a Bell 206, and recent experience could not be determined. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident helicopter, a Bell 206B (serial number 4340), was manufactured in 1995. It was registered with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on a standard airworthiness certificate for normal operations. A Rolls Royce 250-C20J engine rated at 420 horsepower powered the helicopter. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was maintained under an annual inspection program. A review of the maintenance records indicated that an annual inspection had been completed on October 10, 2012, at an airframe total time of 1,343.8 hours. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest official weather observation station was Le Gros Memorial Airport (K3R2), Crowley, Louisiana, located 7 nautical miles (nm) northeast of the accident site. The elevation of the weather observation station was 14 feet mean sea level (msl). The routine aviation weather report (METAR) for K3R2, issued at 1155, reported, wind 070 degrees at 3 knots, visibility 10 miles, sky condition clear, temperature 27 degrees Celsius (C), dew point temperature 20 degrees C, altimeter 30.15 inches.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1145, the sun was at 149 degrees azimuth and 49 degrees altitude. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was located in open, flat terrain at an elevation of 8 feet msl. The debris extended from the tower on an approximate heading of west. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft portion of the tail boom was located in a crawfish pond between the tower and the main wreckage. The tail boom included the tail rotor gear box, the aft portion of the tail rotor drive shaft, the vertical fin, and the tail rotor. The inboard portion of both tail rotor blades remained attached and measured approximately 12 inches in length. The separation of the outboard portion of both blades was consistent with an impact with a cable. The tail rotor rotated without binding and rotation was observed in the tail rotor driveshaft to the point of separation. The tail rotor blades also pivoted correctly and movement was confirmed through the anti-torque tube. The vertical fin was unremarkable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right cabin door was located approximately 50 feet to the north of the aft portion of the tail boom. The Plexiglas was broken and the door was otherwise unremarkable.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor assembly was located in the same crawfish pond to the south of the aft portion of the tail boom. The main rotor consists of two blades which are labeled either white or red for identification purposes. Both remained attached at the main rotor hub.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe white blade was 12 feet in length. Approximately three feet outboard from the hub the blade was partially separated into two pieces. The outboard leading edge of the white blade exhibited paint transfer, red in color. The blade was bent in several locations. The red blade was 16 feet in length. An eight foot section of the center section of the red blade separated and was fragmented. The blade was bent in several locations and the leading edge was unremarkable. The outboard most portion of the main rotor mast separated from the remainder of the driveshaft in overload. Both balance weights remained attached.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main wreckage was located west of the tower, on a service road between two crawfish ponds. The main wreckage included the cabin, instrument panel, engine and transmission assembly, both landing skids, and a portion of the tail boom from the transition area aft to the horizontal stabilizer, and then further aft  an additional 47 inches. The wreckage came to rest inverted oriented on an approximate heading of 240 degrees. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth skids were crushed up into the fuselage; broken, and fragmented. The upper portion of the fuselage was crushed down, broken, and fragmented. The cabin area was crushed, reducing the occupiable space, and the instrument panel was crushed and broken. A tear initiated on the right side of the helicopter near the pilot chin bubble and continued aft at a 45 degree angle for 30 inches. The anti-torque pedals separated and were found to the west of the main wreckage. The tear in the lower fuselage and along the anti-torque pedals was consistent with a cable strike.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was confirmed. The collective separated from the airframe where the mixing unit jack screw was located. The mixing unit was damaged in overload, and the cyclic was impact damaged. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth front seats were broken and partially separated from the airframe. The right and left sides of the fuselage were crushed and wrinkled and all cabin doors had separated and were located in the debris field. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right horizontal stabilizer was unremarkable. The left horizontal stabilizer was crushed in at the outboard edge of the control and had dirt and grass imbedded in the edge and along the position light cover. The damage to the tail boom at the separation point was consistent with a cable strike. There was red paint transfer, rubbing, and grey witness marks along the top and sides of the skin. The bottom portion of the tail boom had a witness mark that was fairly wide and uneven, consistent with the braiding of a cable. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe autopsy was performed by the Calcasieu Parish Coroner’s Office on October 11, 2012, as requested by the Acadia Parish Coroner’s office. The autopsy concluded that the cause of death was multiple injuries sustained in the helicopter accident, and the report listed the specific injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the autopsy, specimens were collected for toxicological testing to be performed by the FAA’s Civil Aerospace Medical Institute, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (CAMI Reference Number 201200257001). Testing of the urine revealed 0.027 ug/ml Oxazepam. Oxazepam is a tranquilizer used in the treatment of anxiety disorders and is a metabolite of Diazepam, Nordiazepam, and Temazepam.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe broadcast tower was registered as KQIS FM tower No. 1061295. The tower was painted red and white, with each painted section being 100 feet in length with 11 different sections. The tower was secured to the ground by three sets of guy wires. According to the most recent sectional aeronautical chart, the broadcast tower was accurately depicted at an altitude of 1,066 feet msl. The broadcast tower was properly marked based upon the guidance outlined in the FAA Advisory Circular 70/7460-1K and the requirements found in the Federal Communications Commission Regulation 47 CFR §§ 17.21-17.50. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The surviving passenger reported that, after taking off, the weather \"began to get worse,\" and the helicopter pilot advised the passengers that they would not be able to make it to their destination airport. The weather worsened, and the pilot decided to divert. When the surviving passenger looked out of the window, it was \"misty and dusky.\" Shortly after, the helicopter struck trees and terrain. A witness reported observing the helicopter flying \"very low\" along the southbound lane of an interstate with all of its lights on just before the accident. He stated that the visibility was low, that the helicopter was under \"low fog,\" and that it was like \"pea soup\" around the area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of meteorological and GPS information indicated that dark night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) existed in the accident area. Light rain was present, and low instrument flight rules conditions existed with vertical visibility of 200 feet and variable visibility of 1/2 mile. Before the accident, the helicopter was flying through this area of weather at a low altitude and an airspeed of about 30 knots. Although the pilot could have returned to the departure airport or landed in a suitable area along his route of flight, he chose to enter IMC despite the availability of safer options and was then forced to divert as the weather worsened. Also, once the helicopter had entered the weather, the sun had already set and minimal ground lighting was present in the heavily wooded area surrounding the interstate. Therefore, it is unlikely that a discernable horizon was present, which would have significantly increased the pilot's workload because it would have required him to reference the helicopter's flight instruments to maintain the helicopter's attitude, flightpath, energy state, and altitude. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel was found onboard the helicopter, and no evidence of any preimpact failure or malfunction of the helicopter, drivetrain, or engine was found that would have precluded normal operation. Review of data recorded by the engine control unit revealed no hard faults or engine operational issues before the beginning of the accident sequence. Recorded data further indicated that the engine was running during the impact sequence and continued to operate for an additional 21 minutes following the accident while the helicopter was resting on its right side, which resulted in reduced oil flow and lubrication to the engine and the eventual postimpact failure of the turbine main line bearings and rotatable parts. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAlthough the pilot held an airline transport pilot certificate that allowed him to fly under IMC in airplanes, he did not possess an instrument helicopter rating. Review of information provided by the helicopter manufacturer revealed no evidence that the pilot had received any inadvertent IMC or instrument flight rules helicopter training when he was at its training center. Examination of the pilot's flight- and duty-time records also revealed that he was scheduled to fly a round trip for the airline he worked for the day after the accident occurred, which likely resulted in self-imposed pressure to complete the trip he was flying on the day of the accident so that he could return home and make his report time for his assigned trip on the following day.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn October 9, 2012, about 2003 eastern daylight time, a Bell 407, N108MF, operated by ACS Helicopters LLC., was substantially damaged when it impacted trees and terrain in Coolbaugh Township, Pennsylvania. The airline transport pilot and one passenger were fatally injured, and one passenger was seriously injured. The corporate flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. Dark night instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the planned flight to Westchester County Airport (HPN), White Plains, New York. The flight last departed Elmira/Corning Regional Airport (ELM), Elmira, New York about 1845.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to recovered cockpit documentation and passenger interviews, on the day of the accident, the helicopter departed Somerset Airport (SMQ), Somerville, New Jersey at 0730 for Morristown Municipal Airport (MMU), Morristown, New Jersey. After arriving at MMU at 0753, the pilot boarded four passengers, and then departed at 0830 for Camden County Airport (19N), Berlin, New Jersey, where it arrived at 0920. After having breakfast, the four passengers then played golf from approximately 1030 to 1500, and then socialized for approximately an hour before returning to the airport, where they once again boarded the helicopter. At 1630, the helicopter then departed for SMQ, landing there at 1710, and deplaned one passenger. At 1720 the helicopter departed once again, this time for ELM with three of the original four passengers onboard. After arriving at ELM at 1830 another passenger deplaned, and at 1845 the helicopter with the pilot and two of the original four passengers departed for HPN. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the surviving passenger, after taking off from ELM, the weather \"began to get worse,\" and the pilot advised them that they would not make it to HPN. The weather became \"even worse\" and the pilot decided to divert to Pocono Mountains Municipal Airport (MPO), Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. The surviving passenger then texted his wife and advised her that they were \"3 miles/ 3 minutes\" from MPO and that they were going to land there. When he looked out of the window it was \"misty and dusky\" and he thought it must have been around 1930 or later. He advised that the \"crash\" happened shortly thereafter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a witness, at approximately 1945, she heard a helicopter that sounded \"like it was going to land on my house\" and that the helicopter was \"extremely low\" at a \"really low altitude\" in the area of Interstate 380 (I-380) and the Daleville exit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA truck driver in the vicinity also reported that he saw the helicopter flying \"very low\" and observed it passing over a Pennsylvania Department of Transportation shed near exit 20 (the Daleville exit) heading southbound along the south bound lane of Interstate 380. All of its lights were on, and at first he thought it was a state trooper 'All lit up\" chasing someone down the highway. He described the helicopter as being \"at or below, 200 feet off the deck.\" The visibility was low, and the helicopter was under the \"low fog.\" He also advised that it was like \"pea soup\" around the area of I-380 and the Daleville exit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a limousine driver who was supposed to pick up one of the passengers at HPN, at 1938 he had received a text from the passenger stating that they were \"running late\". Then at 1953, he received another text instructing him to go back to MMU to pick up the passenger. After arriving at MMU, the driver waited but the helicopter never arrived.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA search by Federal, State, and Local authorities was initiated. On October 10, 2012 at approximately 0230 the helicopter was discovered in a heavily wooded area adjacent to the south bound lane of I-380 approximately 1.3 miles northwest of MPO. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Bell Training Academy, and American Airlines records, the pilot in addition to flying for ACS Helicopters also flew for American Airlines as a First Officer. He held an airline transport pilot certificate with ratings for airplane multi-engine land, commercial privileges for airplane single-engine land, and rotorcraft-helicopter. He also held Type Ratings for the ATR-42, ATR-72, CE-500, DC-9, and HS-125, in addition to a flight engineer certificate for turbojet powered airplanes.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn November 3, 2009, he took his private pilot rotorcraft-helicopter examination in a Robinson R44. On that date, he reported that he had accrued 77 total hours of helicopter flight experience. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFrom November 16th to November 20th, 2009, he attended Bell 407 initial ground and flight training which included ground training, training in a flight training device, and flight training in the Bell 407. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 14, 2010, he took his commercial pilot rotorcraft-helicopter examination in a Robinson R44. On that date, he reported that he had accrued 202 total hours of helicopter flight experience.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn August 9th and 10th 2010, he attended bell 407 refresher training which included ground training, training in a flight training device, and flight training in the Bell 407.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn October 28, 2010, the pilot received one additional hour of flight training in the Bell 407.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 16th and 17th, 2011, he once again attended Bell 407 refresher training which included ground training, training in a flight training device, and flight training in the Bell 407.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 7th and 8th, 2012, approximately 5 months prior to the accident, he attended Bell 407 refresher training again which included ground training, training in a flight training device, and flight training in the Bell 407. At the time of his refresher training he reported to the Bell Training Academy that that he had approximately 400 total hours of helicopter flight experience, which included, approximately 350 hours in the Bell 407, and approximately 50 hours in the Robinson R44.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHis most recent application for an FAA first-class medical certificate was dated June 1, 2012. On that date, he reported 19,000 hours of total flight time. Though he held an Airline Transport Pilot Certificate which allowed him to fly under IMC in airplanes, He did not possess an instrument-helicopter rating, and review of information provided by Bell Helicopter revealed no evidence of any inadvertent IMC or Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) helicopter training for the pilot during training at the Bell Training Academy. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the pilot's flight time and duty time provided by American Airlines revealed that on the day before the accident he had reported for duty at 0810 edt at Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Newark, New Jersey one hour prior to his scheduled departure to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW), Dallas, Texas, then flew 7 hours and 10 minutes arriving back at EWR at 1741 edt. Further examination of his schedule also revealed that he was also scheduled to fly another EWR-DFW-EWR round trip the day after the accident occurred, and was scheduled to sign in at 1155 edt.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident aircraft was a single-engine helicopter of conventional construction. It was equipped with a four-blade, soft-in-plane design, composite hub, main rotor system. A full monococque aluminum skinned tailboom, and conventional two blade tail rotor system. It was powered by a 650 shaft horsepower, Rolls-Royce/Allison 250-C47B turboshaft engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe original electro-mechanical instrumentation and spinning mass gyroscopes had been replaced with a SAGEM Integrated Cockpit Display System (ICDS) which consisted of electronic attitude &amp; heading sensors and two 10-inch liquid crystal displays. One display functioned as a primary flight display and was vertically oriented on the right side of the instrument panel in front of the pilot, and the second display was horizontally-oriented and functioned as an engine instrument and multi-function display on the left side of the instrument panel. Standby analog instruments (clock, airspeed, attitude, and altimeter) were also provided. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was certificated for land operation under day or night visual flight rules (VFR) in non-icing conditions. It was not certificated for IFR operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA and maintenance records the helicopter was manufactured in 2007. The helicopter's most recent annual inspection was completed on August 3, 2012. At the time of the accident, the helicopter had accrued 837.3 total hours of operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSatellite Imagery and Weather Radar&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of satellite imagery of the accident area revealed that cloudy conditions existed over eastern Pennsylvania. Weather radar returned reflectivity values which indicated that light rain was present. Surface temperatures were above freezing indicating that freezing rain and freezing fog were not present.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutomated Surface Observing System.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecorded weather obtained from MPO's automated surface observing system located approximately 1.3 miles southeast of the accident site also revealed that low instrument flight rules weather existed around the time of the accident with vertical visibility of 200 feet and variable auto sensor visibility down to 1/2 mile, with a light east wind and light rain as indicated by METARs where: &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 1953, the recorded weather included: wind 120 degrees at 6 knots, visibility 3/4 mile, light rain, mist, vertical visibility 200 feet, temperature 09 degrees C, dew point 09 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.10 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 2003, the recorded weather included: wind 100 degrees at 6 knots, visibility 1 1/4 miles, light rain, mist, overcast ceiling of 200 feet, temperature 09 degrees C, dew point 09 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.10 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n- At 2017, the recorded weather included: wind 110 degrees at 5 knots, visibility 1/2 mile, light rain, fog, vertical visibility 200 feet, temperature 09 degrees C, dewpoint 09 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 30.10 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSun and Moon Data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the United States Naval Observatory, on the day of the accident sunset occurred at 1829, and the end of civil twilight occurred at 1857. Moon rise did not occur until the following day at 0140. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRPORT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Airport Facility Directory, MPO (the diversion airport), was a publicly owned, uncontrolled airport. It had two runways oriented in a 13/31and 05/23 configuration. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRunway 13 was the closest runway to Interstate 380 and was most closely aligned with the helicopters flight path. It was served by two instrument approaches a VOR approach and a GPS approach. The runway was asphalt, in excellent condition, and was equipped with non-precision runway marking in good condition. The total length of the runway was 5,001 feet, and its width was 75 feet. It was equipped with a 2-light precision approach path indicator located on the left side of the runway and runway end identifier lights. The threshold was displaced by 501 feet. An obstruction in the form of a 29 foot tree, located 348 feet from the runway, 235 feet left of centerline was present which took a 5:1 slope to clear.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFLIGHT RECORDERS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was not equipped with a cockpit voice recorder or flight data recorder nor was it required to be equipped with them under the CFRs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter however was equipped with a Garmin GNS 530 panel-mounted Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, an Apollo SL40 dual Very High Frequency (VHF) communications transceiver, the ICDS, and the engine control unit (ECU). All of which had some capability of data retention.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditionally, a Garmin Aera 560 portable GPS navigation device was also discovered at the accident site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGNS 530&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Garmin Model GNS 530 GPS receiver featured a 5-inch color liquid crystal (LCD) display and offered navigation and communication data, along with precision and non-precision approach certification in the instrument flight rules (IFR) environment. The unit had a slot for a Jeppesen database (front-loading data card) containing all airports, VHF Omni Directional Radio Range (VOR) sites, Non Directional Beacons, NDBs, intersections, Approach, standard terminal arrival routes (STARs), standard instrument departures (SIDs), and special use airspace (SUA) information. A flight plan composed of multiple waypoints, including user-defined waypoints, could be programmed in to the unit. However, no provision had been made to record and store position information within the unit. Data related to last known frequency settings and last known GPS location was stored in volatile memory and could be read from the front panel display upon power-up. There were no provisions for downloading stored data. An internal button-battery was used to back-up power to the internal memory and real-time clock during those periods when main power was removed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the unit revealed the unit had sustained minor damage. The unit was able to power on normally by applying external power, however only the active frequency of 120.1 MHz which was the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport (AVP) control tower frequency and the passive frequency of 121.5 MHz which was the international air distress frequency (emergency frequency) and the helicopter's last known GPS position was captured.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSL40&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Apollo SL40 dual VHF communication transceiver featured a 16 character, 5 x 7, LCD dot matrix LED display. The unit had a frequency range from 118-136.75 MHz and could store up to 8 user defined frequencies. The unit's frequency monitor function could listen to the standby frequency while monitoring the active frequency. The Apollo SL40 would also store the last known frequency settings in non-volatile memory.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the unit revealed that it had sustained minor damage. The unit was able to power on normally by applying external power. During power up, the active frequency of 125.47 MHz which was the Elmira / Corning regional Airport (ELM), automatic terminal information service frequency was displayed and the standby frequency of 122.95 MHz which was the AVP and ELM Unicom frequency was displayed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nICDS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ICDS had recording capability and was capable of storing data on two programing/data cards.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the ICDS revealed that the units had received minor damage and were functional. Each unit contained a slot for insertion of a programming/data card. However, examination of the cards contained in the slots revealed that they were dummy cards which were incapable of storing data.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAera 560&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Garmin Aera 560 portable GPS navigation device employed a 4.3 inch touch-screen and color moving map display. The Aera was also capable of storing tracks logs that contained position location information for an unspecified number of points in non-volatile memory internally. Examination revealed the unit had sustained major damage which required a chip level recovery of the data to be performed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe data extracted during the chip level recovery included 103 tracks (24,504 total data points) which started on August 3, 2012. The accident flight was the last track recorded. It started on October 9, 2012 at 19:35:21 and ended at 20:03:24 and was composed of 2,084 total data points.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of graphical overlays generated from the Garmin Aera 560 data using Google Earth revealed that a large difference existed between the previous altitudes and airspeeds that were stored during the previous 4 flight legs where for example, at 17:49:04 the helicopter was flying at a GPS altitude of 2,642 feet and a GPS groundspeed of 131 knots but, on the last flight leg the last data points indicated that helicopter was flying in the direction of MPO above and along Interstate 380 at low altitude and airspeed, and where examination of the last data point at 20:02:36 indicated that the helicopter was at GPS altitude of 2,162 feet and a GPS ground speed of 31 knots prior to turning slightly right towards the accident site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site revealed that the helicopter had come to rest approximately 200 feet from the right shoulder of the southbound lane of I-380, near a group of approximately 40 foot high trees, in a heavily wooded area, at an elevation of approximately 1,930 feet above sea level, on a magnetic heading of 254 degrees. In close proximity to the wreckage, a large tree with its upper limbs broken off was present. The ground was saturated with fuel, and there was still fuel onboard the helicopter. Further examination of the accident site also revealed that the surrounding trees located adjacent to the accident site to the north and west of the accident site were approximately 50 to 70 feet in height. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo evidence of any preimpact failures, or malfunctions of the aircraft structure, drive train, flight controls, hydraulic system, main rotor system was discovered that would have precluded normal operation, and all observed fractures were consistent with overload forces during the impact sequence with the trees and ground.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the multi-segmented caution light panel also did not display evidence of filament stretching in any of the critical system's bulbs and the standby attitude indicator's gyro assembly showed evidence of rotational scoring internally.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAircraft Structure&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter's structure revealed that after striking trees, the helicopter struck the ground coming to rest on its right side. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll major components were found within approximately 100 feet of the main wreckage. One large section of main rotor blade material (blade skins and honeycomb) was observed suspended on tree branches near the main wreckage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuselage exhibited crushing, fractures, and damage to the right bottom and right side surfaces. The tailboom was fractured aft of the horizontal stabilizer consistent with overload forces at impact however both sections of tailboom remained connected together through an unfractured tail rotor drive segment, and the upper portion of the left horizontal stabilizer end plate had been severed consistent with a main rotor blade strike.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe landing gear exhibited bending of the cross tubes and fracturing consistent with overload on both the fore and aft right cross tubes. The right skid tube also exhibited an overload fracture at the forward saddle. The left side of the landing gear was intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth the pilot and copilot seat belts had been cut by rescue personnel to facilitate recovery of the front seat occupants. Both the pilot and copilot seat pans and seat support structures exhibited downward deformation consistent with impact. The pilot seat structure also exhibited bending to the right consistent with a right side impact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDrive Train&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor hub assembly could be rotated in the direction of normal rotation (counter-clockwise) and free movement of the K-Flex main driveshaft was observed, indicating continuity within the main transmission. Examination of both main transmission chip detectors was performed and no chips were observed. The K-Flex main driveshaft had remained connected at both the transmission and engine ends. The four elastomeric corner mounts between the transmission and mount legs were intact, and all four transmission mount legs were also intact. The right side fore/aft pylon pitch restraint spring assembly exhibited a fractured housing at the forward end consistent with overload forces and the roof mounted right side pylon stop fitting also exhibited mechanical damage on its aft surface consistent with main rotor impact forces being applied through the protrusion on the transmission mounted pylon restraint fitting.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe steel tail rotor driveshaft (1st driveshaft in system) located under the engine exhibited a torsional overload fracture of the tube consistent with a sudden stoppage from the rear while being powered at impact. The oil cooler driveshaft rotated freely. All tail rotor hanger bearings rotated freely and were intact. Some splaying of the Thomas couplings flexure plates was observed, especially in the area surrounding the tailboom fracture. Approximately 1 foot aft of the tailboom fracture, the 2nd to the last driveshaft on the tailboom exhibited a fractured adaptor ear consistent with overload forces. The tail rotor gearbox could be rotated freely and no chips were observed on its chip detector.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight Controls and Hydraulics&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with dual flight controls. The pilot collective stick exhibited a fracture at its base consistent with overload forces. The throttle on the pilot collective stick was found to be in the Fly position. At areas of corresponding airframe damage, various main flight control fractures consistent with overload forces were observed in the vertical tunnel area, under the seats and between the seats. The collective control tube in the vertical tunnel was fractured at approximately the lower third section of the tube consistent with overload forces. The upper portion of the fractured collective tube was moved by hand and control motion was observed through the collective servo to the collective lever. The cracked left and right cyclic vertical control tubes were both moved by hand and corresponding cyclic control movement was observed through the left and right cyclic servos to the non-rotating swashplate. All four pitch change links exhibited fractures consistent with overload in the threads of the bottom rod ends that connect to the outer ring rotating swashplate.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic reservoir was empty with visible signs of hydraulic fluid on roof surfaces near the reservoir, consistent with drainage after impact. Each of the three main rotor servo input connections at the wiredrive joints exhibited intact nuts that had not backed off between the servo wiredrives and the servo valve input levers. Locking tangs were bent over on each wiredrive attachment nut and torque stripe markings were observed to be in-line on each servo. The hydraulic filter buttons on both the Return and Pressure filters, which indicate an impending clogging condition when extended, were observed to be in. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe horizontal control tube attached to the pilot anti-torque control pedals exhibited a fracture at the center pedestal access hole consistent with overload forces at impact. At the accident site, the copilot pedals were manipulated by hand and control movement was observed at the fractured long tail rotor control tube at the area of tailboom fracture. The aft fractured section of the long tail rotor control tube was then moved and corresponding pitch control movement was observed at the tail rotor.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain Rotor Hub and Blades&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll four blades exhibited extensive damage consistent with striking trees during impact. Major portions of each main rotor blade were found near the main fuselage. Several large tree branches were observed cut and fallen to the ground in the vicinity of the accident site. Some afterbody (blade skins and honeycomb) blade sections were observed to be suspended on the branches of nearby trees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Red main rotor blade (Red triangle on blade) exhibited three composite spar fractures consistent with overload forces. The other three blades (Blue, Orange, and Green) exhibited spar damage and blade afterbody damage on the majority of the span of each spar.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll four main rotor hub composite flexure arms were fractured and separated from the hub. The hub flexures exhibited broom straw fracture features consistent with overload fractures from striking trees during the impact sequence. Extensive damage to outboard lead/lag feathering bearings was also observed on all blades, and the Orange and Red blade bearings exhibited complete separation between elastomer layers. The Blue pitch horn was fractured in the middle of the arm consistent with overload forces. The upstops and downstops for each blade on the main rotor hub were extensively damaged consistent with significant up and down blade movement during driven contact with the trees.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTail Rotor Hub and Blades&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth tail rotor blades remained attached to the tail rotor hub assembly. The static stop yield indicator was bent in on both sides of the indicator and evidence of static stop to tail rotor yoke contact was observed on the yoke for each blade side. The Orange blade pitch change link was bent. The tail rotor hub was otherwise intact, with all cotter pins and nuts attached. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Orange tail rotor blade exhibited evidence of a leading edge tip strike to the left side of the tailboom, and red paint transfer marks on the blade leading edge were observed. The left side of the aft tailboom was bent in, and marks on the tailboom consistent with a tail rotor strike were observed. The Green tail rotor blade exhibited a large dent in the leading edge approximately 8 inches from the blade tip.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination and testing of the engine revealed no evidence of any preimpact failures or malfunctions which would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\nOn-Scene Examination of the Engine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn Scene examination of the engine revealed that he right forward engine mount was found to have fractured during the accident however the engine had remained securely attached to the airframe with no visible impact damage. The engine control unit (ECU) was found securely mounted in its normal position with no visible external damage. Both the J1 and J2 HiRel connector plugs were connected and both rings were seated. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring the visual examination, no visible impact damage was noted to the engine. Manual rotation of the N1 drive train at the starter generator revealed continuous rotation to the compressor. Manual rotation of the No.4 power turbine wheel resulted in continuous rotation to the power take off gear. No further examinations were conducted and the engine was shipped to Rolls-Royce Indianapolis for further examination and testing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination and Testing at Rolls-Royce&#x0D;\n. &#x0D;\nOn November 28, 2012 further examination of the engine was conducted at Rolls-Royce, Indianapolis, Indiana under the auspices of the NTSB IIC. As the engine was being prepared for an engine run, examination revealed that both N1 and N2 drive trains exhibited continuity through their respective drive trains during manual rotation. Examination of the upper chip detector revealed however, the presence of a large amount of material. Examination of the lower chip detector revealed it to be void of any material. With the large volume of material present on the upper chip detector it was decided to disassemble the engine in lieu of an attempted engine run. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCompressor &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVisual examination of the compressor found it properly positioned with no visible external damage. The left and right compressor air discharge tubes were in position and properly seated in both the scroll and outer combustion case. Separation of the compressor module from the engine revealed the spur adapter gear shaft to be in position. It was normal in appearance and oil wetted. The No. 2 bearing was also in its proper position, oil wetted and normal in appearance. Manual rotation of the compressor by the spur adapter gear shaft revealed smooth and continuous rotation of the compressor, and the compressor scroll was in position and externally, was also normal in appearance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccessory Gear Box&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth N1 and N2 gear trains were smooth and continuous through the gearbox during manual rotation. Visual examination into the gearbox revealed the inside of the gearbox to contain clean residual oil. The oil pump was in position and visually normal in appearance. The piccolo tube was in position and was also visually normal in appearance.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTurbine&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth the gas producer and power turbine support were in normal position with no visible external damage. The thermal couple harness was in position and displayed no visible damage and probe tips revealed no evidence of burning.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the No. 1 nozzle area revealed it to be normal in appearance. Removal of the stage one nozzle shield revealed outward denting of the No. 8 bearing sump cover nut. Further examination revealed the turbine tie bolt to have fractured approximately one inch aft of the forward end allowing aft movement of the stage one wheel stub shaft and subsequent contact of the tie bolt with the sump cover. The spanner nut was found backed off the stage one wheel stub shaft with no thread engagement. The stage one nozzle was in its normal position with the leading edge side normal in appearance. Examination of the trailing edge side revealed rub damage to the inner rim face and a small dent in the diaphragm from stage one wheel contact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe stage one wheel exhibited blade tip and trailing edge damage from contact with the blade track of the stage two nozzle and the knife seals on the inner hub displayed evidence of rub from contact with the stage two nozzle inner bore. The curvic coupling exhibited smearing due to relative movement with the stage two wheel curvic. Evidence of circumferential rub was noted on the stub shaft from rotational contact with the No.8 bearing inner race. The stage two nozzle exhibited circumferential rub on the leading edge side around the inner rim area and extending into the vane root area with a beginning crack visible in the rim from stage one wheel contact. Rub evidence was also noted in the blade track of the stage one wheel. The trailing edge side of the stage two nozzle displayed rub in the blade track of the stage two wheel. The stage two wheel displayed several blade tips fractured off from contact with the stage two nozzle. The curvic couplings exhibited smearing from relative motion between the stage one wheel with rub damage noted to the inner knife seals from contact with the stage two nozzle bore. The trailing edge side of the stage two wheel exhibited circumferential rub around the inner hub face, and a section of approximately 30 degrees of the inner hub rim had fractured off. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe stage three nozzle leading edge side displayed rub evidence around the face of the inner rim and tang areas. The trailing edge side revealed nicks out of the trailing edges along with trailing edge cracks of several blades with an approximate 90 degree segment of the inner rim lip having fractured off. The stage three wheel leading edge side displayed circumferential rub damage around the outer rim face extending into the leading edges of the blades near the root from stage three nozzle contact. The forward section of the lab seal had fractured off and remained inside the stage three wheel bore. Stage three wheel outer rim knife seals displayed heavy rub damage from contact with the fourth stage nozzle blade track. The trailing edge side revealed circumferential rub around the outer rim face. The curvic coupling was normal in appearance. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth The stage four nozzle leading edge and trailing edge side vanes were normal in appearance with heavy circumferential scoring noted in the both the stage three and stage four wheel blade tracks. The stage four wheel displayed one rub on the leading edge side outer rim face and on the outer rim knife seals from contact with the stage four nozzle. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCombustion System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe outer combustion case which displayed no visual damage was removed to reveal the combustor liner. Visual examination of the inside of the outer combustion case revealed no damage. The combustor liner was normal in appearance with no visible damage or unusual streaking.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFuel System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe hydraulic metering unit (HMU) was undamaged with all line and fittings secure. The fuel line at the fuel nozzle revealed the presence of fuel. Fuel was also noted within the fuel nozzle at removal. The fuel nozzle was visually normal and no excessive carbon was present on the air shroud.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLubrication System&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll engine oil lines were found in position with no visible damage noted. During removal of the lines, all lines were found to be at least finger tight with no evidence of leakage. The engine oil pump was not removed but was visually inspected through gearbox openings and was in position with no visible damage. Manual rotation of the N1 drive train resulted in smooth rotation of the oil pump. The piccolo tube was in proper position and visually undamaged as was the No. 4 bearing oil nozzle. The inline screen at the No.6/7 bearing pressure line \"T\" fitting was clean and exhibited residual oil. The No. 6/7 bearing oil delivery tube exhibited heavy coking to external surfaces. Other than coking, the delivery tube was visually open. The No.8 bearing oil delivery tube displayed coking but was otherwise normal and open to air flow. The No.8 bearing oil nozzle was in position and visually open. The No.8 bearing sump area was dry.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBearings&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe No. 1 and No. 2 bearings remained in position within the compressor and were not removed. Manual rotation of the compressor by the spur adapter gear shaft resulted in smooth rotation of the compressor and both the No.1 and No.2 bearings. Viewed in position the No.2 bearing was oil coated and all balls had a normal appearance. The No.4 and No.2 ½ bearings remained in position were visually normal in appearance but dry. The No.5 bearing was in its normal position and dry. The balls were absent with the inner race exhibiting skidding and grooving.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe bearing bore of the power turbine support was found dry. The No.6 bearing balls were absent with the inner race exhibiting a mushroom appearance over the power turbine inner shaft. The No.7 bearing races were in position however the balls were absent from their position. The No. 8 bearing inner and outer races were in their normal position but the balls were absent. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Shafting&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe power turbine to pinion gear coupling was in position however both Teflon washers had melted from thermal exposure. Both forward and aft splines were visually normal. The power turbine outer shaft was normal in appearance. The power turbine inner shaft displayed some material flaking from thermal exposure, and the No.6 bearing inner race displayed an aft mushroomed appearance. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe spur adapter gear shaft was retained by the forward end within the compressor and was visually normal in appearance however the aft \"O\" ring was absent. The turbine to compressor coupling was also visually normally along its length. The turbine splined adapter was seized in the aft end of the turbine to compressor coupling with a torsional appearance of the splines. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMetallurgical Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe turbine tie bolt which was discovered fractured and the turbine to compressor coupling along with the turbine splined adapter underwent metallurgical examination. Laboratory results indicated that the tie bolt fracture that was discovered was consistent with torsional overload.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe turbine splined adapter and the aft end of the turbine to compressor coupling shaft which were fused together and deformed were also examined. Metallographic evaluation of these components revealed thermal distress.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEngine Control Unit&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine control unit (ECU) which also recorded engine data revealed that the case exhibited no external damage and remained in its normal position during the accident with both J1 and J2 connectors remaining attached. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the information recorded in the Incident Recorder data revealed the following faults from snapshot data records were recorded during the accident:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n• At 746:21:41, a reduction in rotor speed (NR) and torque exceedance were recorded. The time stamp for the reduction in NR was later than the first full record of data in the incident data section and the line of data for the torque exceedance was incomplete indicating that the ECU lost power while writing this line of data.&#x0D;\n• At 746:16:00, a power turbine (NP) exceedance, and Overspeed Solenoid Activation occurred, which was indicative of load being removed from the engine and the ECU sensing an overspeed condition. An NR exceedance was also recorded at this time.&#x0D;\n• At 746:37:30, a measured gas temperature (MGT) exceedance was recorded (21 minutes after the NP exceedance).&#x0D;\n• At 746:37:49, another NR reduction was recorded when a second electrical interruption occurred.&#x0D;\n• At 746:37:37, another MGT exceedance was recorded followed almost simultaneously by another NP exceedance.&#x0D;\n• At 746:37:38, the engine stopped running.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFurther review of the recovered data revealed no preaccident hard faults or engine operational issues prior to the beginning of the accident sequence and that the engine had continued to operate for 21 minutes following the accident while the helicopter was resting on its right side. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was performed on the pilot by Forensic Pathology Associates on behalf of the Monroe County Coroner. Cause of death was multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing of the pilot was conducted at the FAA Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The specimens were negative for carbon monoxide, cyanide, basic, acidic, and neutral drugs with the exception of Ranitidine which was detected in Urine and is an over-the-counter histamine H2-receptor antagonist used to decrease gastric acid production, treat ulcers, and a number of other stomach complaints.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nORGANIZATIONAL AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of documents discovered onboard the helicopter revealed documentation indicating that the Standard Airworthiness Certificate had been issued to a \"N108MG\" (not N108MF) on September 18, 2007. The registration which was issued on July 28, 2009 listed the helicopter as being 108MF which matched the registration number on the helicopter, and that it was registered to ACS Helicopters LLC.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMultiple documents titled \"TRIP SHEET\" were also discovered that contained a space for entries titled: \"Company (circle one) ACS / Aerocare Services.\" A space for entry of a \"Customer\" name was listed, as well as spaces to list passenger names, leg numbers for multiple flight segments, and duty time.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the State of New Jersey, ACS Helicopters LLC was incorporated in 2009, and Aero Care Services LLC was incorporated in New Jersey in 2002. The principal for both companies was the same individual.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA records, neither company held a 14 CFR Part 135 operating certificate. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "According to the operator, the pilot was performing a local postmaintenance flight following a routine phase check that had been completed the previous evening. Several witnesses reported seeing the helicopter start up and enter a low altitude hover before it hover-taxied toward the runway. One witness reported that she saw the helicopter depart on the runway heading and disappear into fog or a low cloud ceiling. Another witness, who also was a pilot employed by the operator, reported that there was mist, fog, and a low cloud ceiling when the helicopter departed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRecovered flight data indicated that, about 20 seconds after takeoff, the helicopter reached a maximum altitude of 255 feet and ground speed of 51 knots while still on the runway heading. The helicopter then entered a left descending turn, during which, it reached a maximum bank angle of 38 degrees to the left and a 20-degree nose-down pitch angle. The helicopter also achieved a 1,600 ft per minute descent during the turn. After turning about 200 degrees from the original departure heading, the helicopter descended into trees and terrain in a nose-low, left-skid-low attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe postaccident examination of the helicopter revealed no evidence of a preimpact failure or malfunction that would have precluded normal operation. Additionally, the engine exhibited damage consistent with it operating at the time of impact. The witness accounts of the helicopter climbing into a low cloud ceiling during initial climb and the subsequent descending left turn shown by the recovered flight data were consistent with the pilot inadvertently encountering instrument meteorological conditions and then attempting a course reversal. Additionally, the helicopter's descent rate and pitch and bank angles during the course reversal were consistent with the pilot lacking a discernible horizon or ground reference to maintain control of the helicopter. Although the helicopter was equipped with basic attitude instrumentation and avionics, it was not certified for flight under instrument flight rules (IFR). Additionally, although he held an instrument rating for helicopters, the pilot was not current for IFR operations nor was it required for his employment as a pilot of helicopters limited to visual flight rules operations.",
    "FactualNarrative": "The accident aircraft was a Bell Helicopter model 407, serial number 53481. The helicopter was configured to transport personnel to/from off-shore platforms. The FAA type certificate required one flight crew member (pilot) and permitted operations under day or night visual flight rules (VFR). Although the cockpit was equipped with flight attitude instrumentation and avionics, the accident helicopter was not certified for flight under IFR. The helicopter was powered by a Rolls-Royce model 250-C47B turboshaft engine, serial number CAE-847752, with maximum takeoff and maximum continuous power ratings of 650 and 600 shaft horsepower, respectively.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was issued a normal category standard airworthiness certificate in June 2001. The helicopter was maintained under an approved aircraft inspection program. The most recent inspection, a routine phase inspection, was completed on October 4, 2012, at 11,465.5 hours total airframe time. The engine had accumulated 7,530.7 hours total time. A review of the available maintenance records did not reveal a history of outstanding maintenance discrepancies. - The Central Industries Airport (2LA0) was located about 1 mile north of Intracoastal City, Louisiana, and was used primarily for off-shore helicopter operations. The private-use airport was served by a single runway: 6/24 (3,100 feet by 75 feet, grass/turf). The airport elevation was 2 feet msl. - The helicopter was equipped with an Appareo Flight Data Monitoring (FDM) system, which included a crash-hardened self-contained flight parameter data recorder. The FDM system consisted of a detached SD memory card storage unit, an internal GPS receiver, and an internal attitude reference unit. The system generated a new data file for each power-up cycle and could store approximately 200 hours of accumulated flight data. The recorded data was used by the operator for their Flight Operations Quality Assurance (FOQA) program. The system recorded 3-axis accelerometer data in addition to GPS positional data. The system, as configured on the accident helicopter, did not record indicated airspeed or any engine parameters. The system was designed to record data on two devices; a data collection device with non-removable memory and a separate removable SD memory card device that was used for normal data retrieval.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe recovered SD memory card contained records from the accident flight and the previous 98 power cycles. The accident flight data file was approximately 6 minutes in duration; however, there was only about 2 minutes of data associated with significant movement of the helicopter over the ground. The data for the accident flight began at 0752:43 (HHMM:SS). The helicopter maneuvered in a low-altitude hover, at a nearly static location over the ground, until about 0756:50, when it began a hover taxi to the northeast. The helicopter turned northwest before it turned to a west-southwest course and began increasing altitude at 0757:55. The plotted position data established that the helicopter performed a takeoff using runway 24. About 20 seconds later, the helicopter reached a maximum altitude of 255 feet and ground speed of 51 knots while still on the departure runway heading. At this time the helicopter entered a left descending turn. During the descending turn, the helicopter reached a maximum bank angle of 38 degrees to the left and a 20 degree nose down pitch angle. The helicopter also achieved a 1,600 feet per minute descent during the turn. The final data point was recorded at 0758:30 with the helicopter at 37 feet altitude, rolled about 20 degrees to the left, and pitched 17 degrees nose down. The last recorded data point was located approximately 113 feet from the initial ground impact point and 255 feet from the final location of the main wreckage. As of the final recorded data point, the helicopter had turned about 200 degrees from the original runway heading. Download of the separate data collection device did not yield additional flight data beyond 0758:30. - On October 5, 2012, about 0758 central daylight time, a Bell 407 helicopter, N406AL, was substantially damaged when it collided with terrain shortly after takeoff from Central Industries Airport (2LA0), near Intracoastal City, Louisiana. The commercial pilot, who was the sole occupant, was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Bristow US LLC, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 while on a company flight plan. Day instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed for the postmaintenance flight that was originating at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the operator, the pilot was performing the postmaintenance flight to identify if there was any residual oil left behind during a routine phase check that had been completed the previous evening. At 0756, the pilot sent an electronic message to the company's flight-following center located in New Iberia, Louisiana, to activate his local flight plan and to report having 1 hour of fuel on-board.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses reported seeing the helicopter startup and enter a low altitude hover over the landing pad before it hover-taxied toward runway 24. One witness reported that she saw the helicopter depart on the runway heading and disappear into fog or a low cloud ceiling. Several witnesses reported hearing a sound consistent with a ground impact shortly after the helicopter had departed toward the southwest. - On October 8, 2012, an autopsy was performed on the pilot at the Louisiana Forensic Center, located in Youngsville, Louisiana. The cause of death for the pilot was attributed to multiple blunt-force injuries sustained during the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute (CAMI) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, performed toxicology tests on samples obtained during the pilot's autopsy. Carbon monoxide, cyanide, and ethanol were not detected. Pioglitazone and Rosuvastatin were detected in blood and liver samples. Pioglitazone, brand name Actos, is a prescription oral antidiabetic agent used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Rosuvastatin, brand name Crestor, is a prescription medication used to treat elevated cholesterol.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA medical documentation, dating back to May 1980, the pilot never disclosed having been diagnosed with diabetes or elevated blood cholesterol levels. Additionally, the pilot did not report the use of any prescription or non-prescription medication on his most recent medical certificate application. - The closest weather observing station to the accident site was located at the Abbeville Chris Crusta Memorial Airport (IYA), about 13.6 miles north-northeast of the departure airstrip. At 0755, the IYA automated surface observing system reported: calm wind, visibility 1/4 mile with fog, an overcast ceiling 200 feet above ground level, temperature 20 degrees Celsius, dew point 20 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 30.14 inches of mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness to the accident flight, who also was a pilot employed by the operator, reported that on the morning of the accident, before sunrise, instrument meteorological conditions prevailed at 2LA0 with a low cloud ceiling and ground fog. He reported that after sunrise, the weather conditions improved for a brief time, which allowed two helicopters to depart the airport under VFR conditions; however, shortly following the two departures, instrument meteorological conditions resumed at the airport. The witness reported that when the accident helicopter departed there was a low cloud ceiling, with mist and fog.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to documentation provided by the operator, at 0634, the base manager issued a weather alert for ground fog and a zero surface visibility at 2LA0, and as such, all VFR helicopter operations were placed on a ground-hold. At 0713, the base manager upgraded the weather conditions to scattered ground fog. The improved weather conditions allowed VFR helicopter operations to proceed under \"caution\" without a requirement to consult the base manager. At 0722, a Bell model 407 (N687AL), departed 2LA0 under VFR conditions and the pilot issued a pilot report (PIREP) for scattered ground fog, but clear weather conditions above the fog layer. Following the accident, at 0802, the base manager issued a weather alert for ground fog and reinstated the requirement that pilots consult with him before a planned VFR departure. At 0827, the base manager issued a weather alert for ground fog and a zero surface visibility. All helicopter operations were ceased following the 0827 weather alert.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother operator based at 2LA0 reported that one of their helicopters had departed about 16 minutes before the time of the accident. The pilot of that helicopter reported that during departure he was able to see down the entire length of the airstrip (3,100 feet by 75 feet). However, after climbing above the surrounding tree line he observed ground fog, approximately 75-100 feet thick, immediately adjacent to the east side of the airbase near the Bristow facility. He reported that as he continued toward his planned destination, toward the west, there were no visibility restrictions. - According to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot, age 62, held a commercial pilot certificate with helicopter and instrument helicopter ratings. His last aviation medical examination was completed on April 18, 2012, when he was issued a second-class medical certificate with a limitation for corrective lenses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to flight time records provided by the operator, the pilot had accumulated 11,386 hours of flight experience, of which 11,262 hours were logged as pilot-in-command. All of the pilot's accumulated flight experience had been completed in helicopters. He had accumulated 619 hours in a Bell model 407 helicopter. He had logged 455 hours at night, 279 hours in instrument meteorological conditions, and 155 hours in simulated instrument conditions. The operator reported that since being hired, in November 2000, the pilot had accumulated 5.0 hours of simulated instrument time. Additionally, the operator reported that the pilot had accumulated 0.5 hours of simulated instrument time in the 12 months preceding the accident. According to the operator, the pilot was qualified and approved to fly Bell models 206 and 407 helicopters; however, neither helicopter model was certified for instrument flight rules (IFR) operations. The pilot's most recent FAA Part 135 Proficiency/Qualification Check for the Bell model 407 helicopter was satisfactorily completed on February 8, 2012. Additionally, on August 15, 2012, the pilot received a separate FAA Part 135 Proficiency/Qualification Check in a Bell model 206 helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had logged 446 hours during the past year, 222 hours during the prior 6 months, 118 hours during previous 90 days, and 43 hours in the last 30 days. The operator reported that the pilot had flown 7 hours within the 24 hour period before the accident flight. - On November 14, 2012, the engine electronic control unit (ECU) was examined at the Triumph Engine Control Systems factory located in West Hartford, Connecticut. An analysis of the nonvolatile data recovered from the ECU revealed that there were no malfunctions in the full authority digital engine control (FADEC) at the time of the accident. There were no unexpected records recorded in the engine history data. Additionally, no incident recorder information was stored on the device, indicating that no event triggers had been detected during the accident flight. The manufacturer attributed the lack of recorded faults during the accident flight to a sudden loss of FADEC system power at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn February 19, 2013, an engine teardown inspection was completed at the Rolls-Royce factory located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The teardown inspection revealed damage to the compressor impeller blades, scoring of the aft impeller face, scoring of impeller inducer shroud, and scoring within the blade tracks of the gas producer and power turbine wheels. The observed damage was consistent with engine operation at the time of impact. Additionally, there was ingested dirt found throughout the engine air flow path. The engine teardown inspection did not reveal any mechanical anomalies that could be associated with a preexisting condition or failure that would have precluded normal engine operation. - A postaccident investigation confirmed that all airframe structural components were located at the accident site. The initial point-of-impact was within a small grouping of trees located about 132 feet south-southwest of the main wreckage. At the initial point-of-impact, there were two small trees that exhibited limb and trunk damage about 20 feet above the ground. A third tree, located about 32 feet into the debris path, exhibited limb and trunk damage about 15 feet above the ground. The magnetic heading between the initial point-of-impact and the main wreckage was about 035 degrees. A depression that was attributed to the left toe skid appeared to be the first ground impact. The left float blow-down bottles were found within the initial ground impact depression. The remaining landing gear components were located between the initial ground impact depression and the main wreckage. The main wreckage consisted of the entire fuselage and tailboom. The fuselage was found resting on its right side against trees and overgrowth. Flight control continuity could not be established due to multiple separations; however, all observed separations were consistent with overstress fractures. All four hydraulic control servos moved freely when manipulated by hand. The transmission, mast, and main rotor hub assembly had separated from the fuselage transmission mounts as a single unit. The main rotor and tail rotor drive systems exhibited impact damage and overstress separations. The main rotor blades remained attached to the hub; however, each blade exhibited bending and delamination consistent with ground impact. The tailboom had separated at the fuselage attach point and exhibited a second fracture immediately forward of the tail rotor gearbox. The tailrotor gear box output shaft rotated freely when moved by hand. One tail rotor blade was found fractured about midspan and the other blade appeared relatively undamaged. The airframe examination did not reveal any evidence of a preimpact failure or malfunction of the helicopter structure, drive train, flight controls, hydraulic system, and main and tail rotor systems that would have precluded normal operation. All observed airframe fractures were consistent with overload forces that were encountered during the impact sequence.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the fuselage by oil supply lines. The engine was found in a vertical position with the compressor section partially buried in dirt and mud. The N1 drive train did not rotate freely because of impacted dirt and vegetation found within the compressor inlet. After the debris was removed, the N1 drive train rotated freely between the starter generator and the compressor. Inspection of the compressor impeller revealed several blade tips that were bent in the opposite direction of rotation. The N2 drive train rotated freely between the No. 4 power turbine wheel and the power takeoff gear. About 1-tablespoon of fuel was collected from the supply line connected to the fuel nozzle. The fuel nozzle appeared undamaged. Other than the presence of dirt and debris, the combustion liner appeared undamaged and normal burn signatures were observed. Examination of the upper and lower magnetic chip detectors established that they were oil-covered and free of foreign material. The engine and its electronic control unit (ECU) were retained for additional examinations. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "During cruise flight, witnesses on the ground reported hearing a grinding or popping noise, which was followed by the separation of the yellow main rotor blade. Examination of the fore/aft servo revealed that the internal threads of the upper rod end fitting on the servo were severely worn. The lower threaded portion of the upper rod end was not found secured into the servo's upper end fitting and was not recovered. Additionally, the upper end fitting was packed with soil as the lower threaded portion of the upper rod end had separated from it prior to ground impact. A 100-hour maintenance inspection of the accident helicopter had been completed on the morning of the accident and a 600-hour inspection of the accident helicopter was completed about 3 months prior to the accident. Neither inspection detected the worn threads on the fore/aft servo upper end fitting. The fore/aft servo had been overhauled about 4 years prior to the accident. Additionally, the fore/aft servo was repaired 10 months prior to the accident and no anomalies were observed with the threads at that time. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator used Mastinox, a corrosion inhibiting compound, during installation of the upper rod ends to the right-roll, left-roll, and fore/aft servos. The helicopter manufacturer's maintenance manual listed only G.355 grease and did not prescribe for the use of Mastinox. However, the standard practices manual stated that a torque correction factor of 0.4 is used for G.355 grease, but not for Mastinox, since the latter is not a lubricant. The torque value listed in the manual for the rod ends already took a torque correction factor into account. A higher torque value would theoretically have been necessary when Mastinox was used in place of G.355 grease. The operator stated an adjusted torque value was not used during installation of the upper rod ends using Mastinox. Evidence of sealant at the junction of the upper rod end and nut, which was required to be applied during servo installation per the maintenance procedures, was not found on either the right-roll or left-roll servos. While the lack of sealant may not result in a catastrophic event, its breakage or absence (and/or radial play of a servo end bearing) noted during a maintenance inspection could be indicative of a loss of torque. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of the helicopter manufacturer's checklists and maintenance manuals revealed some guidance for servo inspections. The daily operating check (after the last flight of the day) included an instruction to check the main rotor servos for security and absence of leaks. The 600-hour inspection called for checking the radial play of the end bearings; however, there were no instructions to specifically check the threads of the servo end fitting or the torque of the rod end nut.",
    "FactualNarrative": "Fore/Aft Servo&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Air Equipment F6103 31026-010 (serial number 68) fore/aft servo was manufactured in 1981 and installed on the accident helicopter in 1994. It's most recent overhaul was completed by Aerocopter Component Services (ACS), Ontario, Canada, in March 2008. In August 2010, the fore/aft servo was repaired by ACS and recertified to manufacturer specifications in accordance with Air Equipment Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) No. 67-39-10. Specifically, a bearing was replaced due to play in the pilot valve. In November 2011, the fore/aft servo was again repaired by ACS and recertified to manufacturer specifications in accordance with the same CMM. During the second repair, items were replaced due to hydraulic fluid seepage. A manager at ACS stated that during the most recent repair, the threads were inspected per the CMM and no discrepancies were observed at that time. Review of the CMM revealed, \"…check all male and female threads for general condition…\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of MET WC 05.21.00.603, titled \"Daily Operating Checks\" (after last flight of day) revealed, \"Servocontrols, hydraulic system. Security, absence of leaks, lines.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of MET WC 05.23.00, titled \"Basic Inspection\" (T Inspection/600-hour Inspection), section 6.3, revealed:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"Servo-controls and particularly rod end bearings&#x0D;\n(Fig. 1, DETAIL B) :&#x0D;\nDisconnect a mounting pin (W.C. 67.30.00.402 or 67.30.15.402).&#x0D;\nManually check that radial play (J) is normal, the second anchoring point being used as fulcrum. J &#x0D;\nIf in doubt, remove servo-control as per W.C. 67.30.00.402 or 67.30.15.402 for check in workshop.&#x0D;\nConnect or install servo-control as per W.C. 67.30.00.402 or 67.30.15.402.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhile the Basic T/600-hour inspection called for checking radial play of the rod end bearings, there was no specific guidance to check either the security (torque) of the rod end nut to the servo end fitting or to inspect the condition of the threaded connection. Review of Eurocopter Standard Practices Manual W.C. 20.02.05.404 contained general guidance for the inspection of threaded components, which must be performed each time an externally threaded part is removed. Other than the note in the daily operating check to look for security and absence of leaks, there was no other guidance specifically pertaining to the security of the rod end connection to the servo end fitting. - The six-seat helicopter, serial number 5227, was manufactured in 1982. It was equipped with two Rolls-Royce (Allison) 250-C20F, 420-shaft horsepower engines. The helicopter was maintained under a manufacturer's approved inspection program. It's most recent inspection was a 100-hour inspection, which was completed on the morning of the accident in conjunction with the installation of the repaired main transmission. At that time, the helicopter had accumulated 11,431.3 hours of operation. The helicopter's most recent 600-hour inspection was completed on June 5, 2012. At that time, the helicopter had accumulated 11,332.7 hours of operation. - On September 15, 2012, at 1200 eastern daylight time, an Aerospatiale AS 355F1, N58020, operated by Analar Corporation, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain following an in-flight breakup near West Windsor, New Jersey. The commercial pilot was fatally injured. The positioning flight was conducted under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed and no flight plan was filed for the planned flight to Atlantic City International Airport (ACY), Atlantic City, New Jersey. The flight originated from Princeton Airport (39N), Princeton, New Jersey, about 1155.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the owner and president of the operator, the helicopter had flown during the summer with a loaner main transmission, while its own transmission was sent out for repair. After the repair was complete, the helicopter's main transmission was received and then reinstalled on September 13, 2012. After the installation, the president conducted a maintenance ground run, followed by a 30-minute maintenance test flight, with no anomalies noted. Earlier during the day of the accident, the accident pilot completed a roundtrip flight uneventfully, with a relative of the helicopter owner onboard. Specifically, the pilot flew from 39N to the West 30th Street Heliport (JRA), New York, New York, picked up the passenger, and flew back to 39N. At the conclusion of that flight, the helicopter was \"hot fueled\" to its maximum fuel capacity and then departed on the accident flight to pick up another relative of the helicopter owner at ACY. The president estimated that the helicopter had flown approximately 1 hour 10 minutes since the installation of the transmission when the accident occurred.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to information from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the helicopter was in radio and radar contact with McGuire Approach Control. Radio and radar contact were lost at 1200 and no distress calls were received. Witnesses near the area of the accident site reported hearing a banging, explosion, or engine rev noise, followed by a piece separating from the helicopter and the helicopter spiraling nose down toward the ground. - An autopsy was performed on the pilot by the Mercer County, Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, West Trenton, New Jersey, on September 17, 2012. The cause of death was noted as \"Massive multiple traumatic injuries.\" Toxicological testing was performed on the pilot by the FAA Bioaeronautical Science Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Review of the toxicological report revealed:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n\"Metoprolol detected in Blood\" - Trenton Mercer Airport (TTN) was located about 7 miles west of the accident site. The recorded weather at TTN, at 1153, was: wind 350 degrees at 9 knots, gusting to 16 knots; visibility 10 miles; sky clear; temperature 21 degrees C; dew point 9 degrees C; altimeter 30.14 inches Hg. - The pilot, age 65, held a commercial pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine land, rotorcraft helicopter, instrument airplane and instrument helicopter. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued on July 21, 2012. It was a deferred issuance due to a new onset of atrial fibrillation. He was previously issued a second-class medical certificate on September 12, 2011. According to employer records, the pilot had a total flight experience of approximately 11,100 hours; of which, about 2,200 hours were in the same make and model as the accident helicopter. The pilot had flown about 21 hours during the 90 days preceding the accident. - The helicopter came to rest upright in a cornfield, on a magnetic heading of 305 degrees. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the cockpit and cabin. Due to fire damage, flight control continuity could not be confirmed. Both antitorque pedals were installed. The right cyclic was installed and the left cyclic was located in the field next to the rotorhead, consistent with its removal prior to flight. The right collective was installed and fire damaged. The left collective was not recovered. The majority of the instrument panel, including the caution warning panel, was consumed by fire. Three identifiable engine instruments were recovered; however, their indicating needles were loose. One front seat buckle was identified and noted as unclasped. Both forward cabin doors were found about 50 yards from the main wreckage. The doorpost and segments of the windshield remained attached to the right door. The doorpost and windshield were found separated from the left door (for more information, see Wreckage Plot in the public docket).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft section of tailboom was not consumed by fire and exhibited impact damage. The right horizontal stabilizer was separated near the root and a segment of the right horizontal stabilizer was recovered about 165 yards southeast of the main wreckage. The separation signatures were consistent with main rotor blade contact. The left horizontal and upper vertical stabilizers remained attached and were undamaged. The ventral fin remained attached; however, the lower end of the fin sustained impact damage. The tailboom had separated forward of the horizontal stabilizer. The tailrotor driveshaft remained intact from the tailrotor gearbox to just prior to the forward spline, where the tailrotor driveshaft had melted. One tailrotor blade remained attached to the tailrotor hub. The other tailrotor blade separated at the hub and was found 25 yards north, consistent with impact damage. The left engine cowling, with its intake screen, was located about 140 yards south of the main wreckage. The cowling was coated with clean (light yellow/brown) oil on both sides.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe rotorhead, located about 100 yards southwest of the main wreckage, included the top portion of transmission (the conical housing with the epicyclic and ring gear attached), the main rotor shaft, the starflex, and the red and blue main rotor blades with their sleeves and spherical thrust bearings attached. Also included were two servos (left-roll and right-roll) and three pitch change rods. A third servo (fore/aft) was found near the rotorhead, but had separated at both rod end connections; both upper and lower rod end bearings remained attached to the stationary swashplate and conical housing, respectively. The entire yellow main rotor blade and sleeve assembly had separated from the rotorhead and was later recovered about 270 yards southeast of the main wreckage. The yellow star arm had separated from the starflex and was located about 40 yards south of the main wreckage. The lower (stationary) scissor link assembly separated from both hinges and was not recovered. The rotorhead had separated from the main transmission near the upper flange of the bevel gear reduction module's cylindrical housing; the fracture surface remained intact with the separated rotorhead (for more information, see Airworthiness Group Chairman Factual Report in the public docket).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMetallurgical examination of the retained components revealed that the upper rod end of the fore/aft servo (actuator) remained attached to the swashplate and exhibited a bending overstress fracture near its neck. The lower threaded end of the upper rod end (shank, nut, and lock washer) was not in the actuator and was not recovered. The mating threads of the fore/aft servo upper end fitting exhibited severe wear, consistent with thread wear occurring over a period of time. The upper end fitting was packed with soil, consistent with its exposure prior to ground impact. Additionally, new thread impressions were observed, below the original worn threads, consistent with a vibration of the shank in the actuator hole. Metallurgical examination of all other retained components did not reveal any preimpact mechanical malfunctions (for more information, see Materials Laboratory Factual Report in the public docket.)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEvidence of Mastinox, a corrosion inhibiting compound, was found on the threaded shank of the left-roll and right-roll servo’s upper rod end (threaded shank of fore/aft servo upper rod end not recovered). Evidence of Mastinox was not found on the remnant upper rod end and end fitting of the fore/aft servo; however, the operator reported that they used Mastinox for the servo connections due to the dissimilar metals (aluminum and steel) and covered the Mastinox with a \"thin\" layer of grease. No evidence of grease was observed on the servo rod ends or fittings. For the servo rod ends’ threaded connection, the Eurocopter maintenance manual (MM) listed only G.355 grease and did not prescribe for the use of Mastinox. However, the Eurocopter standard practices manual stated that a torque correction factor of 0.4 was used for G.355 grease, but not for Mastinox. According to a representative from Eurocopter, the torque value listed in the manual for the rod ends already took the torque correction factor into account and a higher torque would have been necessary when Mastinox was used in place of G.355 grease. The operator reported that they did not adjust torque factor when using the Mastinox with a \"thin\" layer of grease. Additionally, evidence of sealant at the junction of the upper rod end and nut was not found on either the left-roll or right-roll servos (the sealant area on fore/aft servo was not recovered for inspection). Maintenance procedures for the installation of the rod ends of the servo-controls were found in the Eurocopter Maintenance Manual (MET) Work Card (WC) 67.30.15.401. Review of the WC revealed \"…Apply a bead of sealant on the nut (8) and the thread of the ball end (1)…\" -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot and his passenger were conducting a low-level aerial photography operation in a helicopter when the engine stopped producing power. Several witnesses observed the helicopter descend vertically to the ground as the body of the helicopter spun to the left around the main rotor blades. A postimpact fire consumed most of the helicopter. A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation. Although the weather conditions at the time of the accident were conducive to the formation of carburetor icing at cruise and glide power settings, the investigation could not conclusively determine that carburetor ice caused the loss of engine power. The cause of the power loss could not be determined.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 10, 2012, about 1545 central daylight time, N281RG, a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain during a low-altitude maneuvering flight in Houston, Texas. The commercial pilot and the passenger were fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to and operated by Helicopter Services, Incorporated, Spring, Texas. Day visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident. No flight plan had been filed for the 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 aerial photography flight. The helicopter had departed Baytown Airport (HPY), Baytown, Texas, approximately 1500.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter originally departed David Wayne Hooks Memorial Airport (DWH), Houston, Texas, about 1200, and flew in the local area before landing at HPY around 1425. Fueling records indicate the helicopter was serviced with 22.9 gallons of 100LL fuel at 1429. Around 1500, the Baytown Airport manager saw the pilot and the passenger depart toward the southwest. Approximately 45 minutes later, the helicopter was observed by several witnesses maneuvering over the steel pipe yard near the accident location.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness was driving west on Highway 90 toward the beltway when he first observed the helicopter. He said it was about a mile away and at first he thought it was a remote controlled helicopter. The witness said the helicopter was “way up there” and estimated that it was about 400-500 feet above the ground. The helicopter was spinning slowly (he did not recall what direction it was turning) around the main rotor shaft and was descending vertically about 70-80 miles per hour as if it had \"lost power.\" There was no smoke or parts coming off the helicopter as it descended. The main rotor blades were turning \"slower than expected\" and were not deflected upward. The witness said that the tail rotor did not appear to be turning. The helicopter then impacted the ground, which resulted in a large dust cloud. The witness stopped his vehicle and ran towards the helicopter. After he negotiated a chain link fence, he and another witness used fire extinguishers to contain the post-impact fire, which he described being more intense on the right side of the helicopter, until the fire department arrived.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother witness was driving east on Highway 90 toward the beltway when he first observed the helicopter about a mile away. It was 70 to 100 feet-high above the ground and was slowly spinning counter-clockwise around the main rotor shaft and was in a slow vertical descent. The witness said the helicopter seemed to move in “slow-motion.” When it was approximately 40 to 50 feet above the ground, the helicopter’s descent rate increased rapidly before it impacted the ground. The witness thought the pilot was trying to land and he did not observe any smoke coming from the helicopter prior to impact. He noted that the main rotor blades were turning “pretty slow” and it seemed “like he lost power.” The body of the helicopter was level and the main rotor blades were not deflected upward. The witness could not hear the helicopter prior to the impact, which occurred just as he was stepping out of his vehicle. After the impact, he observed a large dust plume as he was running to the steel yard. Seconds later, as he was trying to crawl under a chain link fence, he saw a fireball coming from the helicopter. He and another responder used fire extinguishers to contain the post-impact fire until the fire department arrived.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo witnesses, who were driving together westbound on Highway 90, stated they first observed the helicopter when it was about 1 to 1.5 miles away.  They said the helicopter was spinning counter-clockwise and was approximately 75-feet-high above the ground.  One of the witnesses thought the pilot was attempting to avoid the highway and drifted over toward the steel pipe storage yard.  Neither witness saw any smoke or debris trailing the helicopter and did not hear the helicopter prior to impact. One of the witnesses said the helicopter descended quickly (about 30 seconds). The nose of the helicopter was pointed down toward the ground and the main rotor blades did not look like they were moving. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAnother witness was working on a construction site located about a 1/4-mile from where he first observed the helicopter. He said the helicopter was hovering over a building near the accident site “real low.” All appeared to be normal. The witness lost sight of the helicopter for about 10 minutes due to work related reasons before he saw the helicopter a second time. This time, the helicopter was hovering around 100 to 150-feet-high above the ground over the steel pipe yard. The nose of the helicopter was pointed toward the north. He could not hear the helicopter from his location. The witness said that the helicopter hovered for approximately 1 to 1.5 minutes before it “leaned sideways” to the east and the “tail came around on him.”  The helicopter then began to turn to the right slowly as it began a slow vertical descent in a slight nose-down and to-the-right attitude. The witness said the helicopter spun 4 to 4.5 times in a “wide-motion” as it descended “straight down” at a speed of 10-15 mph, as if the pilot was trying to correct for the situation. He said the main rotor blades were turning and deflected slightly upward, but he could not estimate how fast. He never looked at the tail rotor. The witness said from the time the helicopter entered the right turn to the time it impacted the ground it was about 10-15 seconds. Once on the ground, he could still see the main rotor blades. Approximately 30 seconds later, he saw that the helicopter had caught on fire and called 9-1-1 emergency. He did not respond to the scene.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a commercial pilot certificate for rotorcraft-helicopter. His last Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) first class medical was issued on December 16, 2011. According to the operator, the pilot had accrued a total of 757 flight hours, of which, 619 hours were in the R22B.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot had not attended the Robinson Pilot Safety Course prior to the accident, but was scheduled to attend a future class.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather reported at Ellington Field (EFD), Houston, Texas, approximately 16 miles southwest of the accident site, at 1550, was wind 130 degrees at 8 knots, visibility 10 miles, scattered clouds at 8,000 feet, temperature 93 degrees F, dewpoint 62 degrees F, and an altimeter setting of 30.02 inches of Mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe carburetor icing probability chart from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin (SAIB): CE-09-35 Carburetor Icing Prevention, June 30, 2009, shows a possibility of icing at cruise/glide power at the temperature and dew point reported at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest upright on a heading of 195 degrees on a dirt road located inside a steel pipe storage yard. The entire helicopter was accounted for at the site and sustained extensive post-impact fire damage. The skids were spread and level with the belly of the fuselage. The body of the helicopter was listed to the right.&#x0D;\nA postaccident examination was conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Investigator-in-Charge (IIC) on September 12-13, 2013. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter revealed that the cockpit area was consumed by fire. The remains of a camera bag, along with several lenses, and several unidentified electronic devices were found in the area near the collective.  These devices were sent to the NTSB Recorders Laboratory in Washington DC, and no data was able to be retrieved due to thermal damage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe removable controls were not installed at the co-pilot's station on the left side. The pilot’s left anti-torque pedal was positioned forward and the collective was mid travel. Both seat structures were fully collapsed.&#x0D;\nFlight control continuity was established for all flight controls to the cockpit.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main fuel tank was partially consumed by fire and the rear exterior skins were bulged and slightly deformed. A puncture hole was observed in the fuel tank and also through the firewall that sat below the tank.  The puncture came from the bottom up. The #2 spark plug that sat directly underneath the puncture hole exhibited damage to the top of its ignition lead.  The tank’s fuel cap was secure to the filler neck and the fuel finger-screen was absent of debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe auxiliary fuel tank was mostly consumed by fire. The crossover line was disconnected and exhibited thermal damage at both ends of the fuel disconnect. The fuel cap was secure to the filler neck and the fuel finger-screen was absent of debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe gascolator was thermally damaged. When the unit was disassembled, the gasket was found dry and brittle consistent with heat exposure. There was a small amount of debris on the fuel-screen.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel system’s vent lines, hoses and tubes were all consumed by fire. No blockages or fuel were found in any of the remaining fuel lines. All of the B-nuts for the fuel supply lines were finger tight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuel control located in the cockpit was observed to be in the “ON” position and the fuel-mixture control was in the full rich position. The carburetor-heat control was unlocked and raised approximately 1-inch. The governor switch was in the “ON” position and the throttle connecting rod on the collective was in the full open position. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe clutch annunciator light and the low rotor RPM warning light were examined by an NTSB Materials Engineer. Examination of the clutch light revealed that the light bulb filament heat coil stretching, indicative of the light being on at the time of impact. The low rotor RPM warning light had heat damage to the extent the bulb melted on to itself and the filament. The filament was broken but exhibited no hot coil stretching.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe skids remained attached to the fuselage and were spread apart and even with the belly of the fuselage. Both cross tubes were bent up at the ends. The aft cross tube was separated at both ends due to impact. The forward right strut was slightly bowed. The heel of the right skid tube was consumed by fire. The toe of the left skid had separated at the forward strut mount. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe V-belts sustained extensive thermal damage. Small sections of V-belt remnants were found on the horizontal firewall; in the grooves of the sheaves, and on the ground below the sheaves at the accident site. The upper sheave was partially consumed by fire. The sprag-bearing moved freely when manually rotated opposite the direction of drive and locked onto the driveshaft when rotated in the direction of drive. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor gearbox rotated freely by hand. The intermediate flex coupling was bent and twisted. There was rotational scoring on the frame adjacent to the intermediate flex coupling. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe inboard section of the main rotor blades sustained thermal damage. No damage was noted to the remaining portion of the blades. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail rotor blades were separated at the root and exhibited rotational scoring at the tips. The tail rotor driveshaft damper bearing sustained thermal damage but rotated freely. The tail rotor gearbox rotated freely and smoothly.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine remained attached to the airframe during the impact sequence and sustained varying degrees of thermal damage. Impact damage was observed on the exhaust system, air box, carburetor, fan and scroll. The scroll was completely consumed by fire. The outer edge of the cooling fan was dented at the 6 o’clock position. There were no indications of any rotational scoring. The starter ring gear did not contact any other engine accessories or components and the upper sheave did not exhibit any rotational scoring.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe air-box was pushed up into and around the carburetor. The filter was thermally damaged. The carburetor float bowl was separated from the carburetor and the brass floats were crushed. The fuel inlet fitting was disconnected from the carburetor due to impact and the carburetor inlet finger screen was dislodged and absent of debris. The fuel mixture arm on the carburetor was disconnected from its shaft due to impact. However, the control-wire hardware was secure and the wire appeared to be in a full rich position.  The carburetor heat slider valve was open .400-inch, which corresponded to a carburetor heat selection of about 13 percent of full heat. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe spark plugs were removed and each displayed a low service life and a color consistent with normal combustion when compared to the Champion Spark Plug Wear Guide P/N AV-27.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEach cylinder was then examined using a lighted bore-scope and no defects were noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBoth magnetos sustained extensive thermal damage and were observed on their respective mounts; however, the right magneto’s upper mount was not fully secure to the magneto clamp. The upper right clamping nut was partially backed away from the magneto clamp. The left magneto was them removed from the engine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe oil sump was intact; however, all oil carrying lines were consumed by fire. The oil suction screen was removed and absent of debris. The oil filter was removed and the element was thermally damaged. An unmeasured amount of oil was observed in the oil sump. The oil cooler exhibited thermal damage and the oil pump rotated freely by hand.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine could not be manually rotated by the front sheave. The accessory housing and right magneto were then removed and another attempt was made to rotate the engine by hand. This attempt was successful and compression was obtained on #1, #3, and #4 cylinders. Continuity was also established for the valve train, crankshaft, and accessory gears.  The #2 cylinder sustained extensive thermal damage around the valve springs. Each of the springs had diminished tensile strength. The #2 cylinder was removed and examined. The piston and piston pin were unremarkable. The intake and exhaust valves and push rods were undamaged, but the exhaust valve’s rocker arm bushing was loose.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was conducted on the pilot by the Harris County Medical Examiner's Office, Houston, Texas, on September 11, 2012.  According to the autopsy report, the cause of death was \"blunt force and thermal injuries.\"&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing was conducted by the FAA Toxicology Accident Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The tests were negative for all items tested.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Robinson R22B Pilot Operating Handbook, page 3-2, the emergency procedures for a power failure (autorotation) between 8 feet and 500 feet above ground level (agl) are:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n1)\tTakeoff operation should be conducted per the Height-Velocity diagram in Section 5&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n2)\tIf power failure occurs, lower collective immediately to maintain rotor RPM&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n3)\tAdjust collective to keep RPM in green arc or apply full down collective if light weight prevents attaining above 97%&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n4)\tMaintain airspeed until the ground is approached, then begin cyclic flare to reduce rate of descent and forward speed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n5)\tAt about 8 feet agl, apply forward cyclic to level ship and raise collective just before touchdown to cushion landing. Touch down with skids level and nose straight ahead. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "A witness who spoke with the pilot before the flight reported that the pilot had checked the fuel before departure and intended to \"make a couple of laps\" before proceeding to a local airport to purchase more fuel. Another witness observed the helicopter perform two 180-degree turns before it descended and impacted the ground. Examination of the accident site confirmed a vertical impact, and the helicopter damage was consistent with low or minimal rotor speed at the time of impact. Inspection of the fuel system revealed no fuel in the right fuel tank and about 2 pints of fuel in the left fuel tank. No contamination was observed in the fuel on board, and no obstructions were observed in the fuel system. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe experimental amateur-built helicopter was constructed from a kit and received its airworthiness certificate in 2003. The pilot purchased the helicopter about 4 months before the accident through the kit manufacturing company, which was brokering the sale of the helicopter for the builder’s estate. The pilot did not hold a pilot certificate and did not register the helicopter with the FAA. Examination of the pilot's logbook revealed that about 2 years before the accident, he had received 3.2 hours of helicopter instruction. Interviews revealed that when the pilot acquired the helicopter, he flew an additional 15 hours with the owner of the helicopter kit manufacturing company (in the accident helicopter and another company helicopter). However, these flights were limited to hover practice.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIt is likely that while the pilot was maneuvering the helicopter at a low altitude, it experienced a loss of engine power due to fuel exhaustion. At this point, the pilot needed to immediately enter an autorotation. However, given the pilot’s limited flight training and his lack of pilot certification (he would have had to demonstrate an autorotation in order to become a certificated helicopter pilot), he almost certainly was not proficient in performing autorotations. The helicopter’s vertical impact with low rotor rpm is consistent with the pilot failing to make the control inputs necessary to enter an autorotation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 1, 2012, at 0900 eastern daylight time, N70415, experimental amateur-built Safari helicopter was substantially damaged when it impacted the ground while maneuvering in McVeytown, PA. The non-certificated pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal, local flight that was conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR Part 91. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a witness, he observed the helicopter flying away from him, and then made a 180-degree turn toward the hangar it was kept in. The helicopter then made another 180-degree turn and \"started to go down.\" The witness observed a puff of smoke as the helicopter disappeared from his view. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) database revealed the pilot did not hold a pilot certificate. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a pilot logbook provided by the pilot's wife, he logged three flights on: August 14, 2010, August 21, 2010, and October 9, 2010. The total flight time for these flights was 3.2 hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was built from a kit, by the previous owner, and received its first airworthiness certificate on April 10, 2003. It was equipped with a Lycoming O-320, 160-horsepower engine. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident pilot purchased the helicopter in March 2012; however, there was no evidence that he attempted to acquire an airworthiness certificate or register the helicopter with the FAA. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the helicopter and engine logbooks revealed the most recent condition inspection was completed on June 30, 2011 by the previous owner/builder. No anomalies were noted in the entry, and a tachometer time of 395 hours was noted. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tachometer time at the accident site was 442 hours. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the kit manufacturer, they brokered the sale of the helicopter between the accident pilot and the widow of the previous owner/builder. After the accident pilot purchased the helicopter, the kit manufacturer performed some maintenance on it to assure it was in a flyable condition. The work they performed included: replacing the main rotor spindle, and performing an annual condition inspection. This work was completed on May 11, 2012. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe weather recorded at the nearest airport, at 0853, included wind from 280 degrees at 7 knots, 10 miles visibility, a broken cloud layer at 7,000 feet, temperature 23 degrees C, dew point 19 degrees C, and altimeter setting 30.13 inches mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the accident site confirmed the helicopter impacted the ground in a vertical attitude with minimal forward speed. Inspection of the main rotor blades and tail rotor blades revealed damage consistent with low or minimal rotor speed (RPM) impact with terrain. Main and tail rotor control system continuity was confirmed from the cockpit to the control surfaces. Inspection of the fuel system revealed no fuel in the right fuel tank and approximately 2 pints in the left fuel tank. A sample of fuel from the left tank was found to be free of contamination and consistent with 100LL aviation fuel. The carburetor bowl drain was opened and fuel was observed. No obstructions were noted in the fuel system, or the air induction system. The fuel selector was in the ON position. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine crankshaft was rotated at the propeller flange and thumb compression and valve train continuity was confirmed on all four cylinders. No mechanical anomalies were noted during the engine examination. [Additional information regarding the on-scene helicopter examination can be found in the FAA Inspector Statement located in the public docket.]&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Mifflin County Coroner performed an autopsy on the pilot on September 1, 2012. The cause of death was listed as blunt force trauma.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA Toxicology and Accident Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma conducted toxicological testing on the pilot. No drugs or alcohol were noted in the testing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness who spoke with the pilot prior to the flight reported that the pilot had \"five and a half inches\" of fuel in the helicopter prior to departure. He reported the pilot intended to \"make a couple of laps,\" and then they were going to fly to the local airport to purchase more fuel. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the kit manufacturer, when the pilot arrived at their facility to acquire the helicopter in May 2012, the owner of the kit manufacturing company flew with the pilot for about 15 hours (both in a company helicopter and in the accident helicopter). The purpose of these flights was for the pilot to practice hovering the helicopter. Because the pilot did not have a pilot's license and was not familiar with this type of helicopter, the company owner told him not to lift the helicopter more than 2 feet off the ground, once he arrived home, until he received instruction in it. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the pilot's wife, she believed the pilot flew the helicopter for the first time after it arrived at their home from the manufacturer's facility, on July 4, 2012. She estimated the pilot flew approximately every other weekend since then (three times in July and two in August).The pilot's wife believed the flights only included the pilot practicing lifting the helicopter off the ground and setting it back down again. He may have circled the field where he kept the helicopter, but she believed that would have been the longest duration of a flight. The pilot's wife was not aware that he intended to fly the helicopter on the day of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the Height-Velocity diagram contained in the Safari Helicopter Flight Manual revealed that operations below an altitude of 400 feet and below airspeeds of 50 knots should be avoided. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA Rotorcraft Flying Handbook, FAA-H-8083-21, the height/velocity (H/V) diagram depicts critical combinations of airspeed and altitude should an engine failure occur. Operations in crosshatched or shaded areas of the H/V diagram may not allow enough time for the critical transition from powered flight to autorotation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was transporting passengers across a lake and home from a race track at night. A witness who was boating on the lake across from the helicopter landing area watched the helicopter approach and land. He stated that the landing light was on during the landing. He watched the passengers exit the helicopter and then the helicopter lift off and turn toward the lake, descend down an embankment, and turn over the lake. The witness stated that the landing light was not on during the departure. The helicopter traveled about 150 yards when the bottom skids began to make the water spray. The helicopter then nosed over and impacted the water. The witness then directed his boat toward the impact area where he found the tail boom separated from the fuselage and the cockpit area submerged. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the fuselage, including the top Plexiglas window and frame, revealed evidence of main rotor contact. The helicopter's engine was torn from the fuselage and could not be located due to poor visibility in the water and its irregular bottom features. The engine control unit (ECU) was retrieved, and all of the data revealed that no engine operating exceedances occurred before impact, and no accumulated engine faults were recorded during the previous engine run. The ECU data and physical evidence are consistent with power being supplied to the main rotor at the moment of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSecurity camera video footage revealed that the pilot had successfully conducted this low-level, rapid acceleration takeoff profile several times during the day when visual spatial references were plentiful. The available data and evidence, as well as the previous flights, are consistent with controlled flight into water while conducting a rapidly accelerating, low-altitude flight after takeoff over an unlit body of water in dark night conditions. The pilot's decision to attempt a such a takeoff at night without the aid of ambient light or the use of helicopter lights denied him the visual spatial references needed to assure safe terrain and obstacle avoidance. Additionally, the conditions during the flight were conducive to a type of pilot spatial disorientation known as \"somatogravic illusion,\" in which aircraft acceleration may be misinterpreted by the pilot as an increasing nose-up pitch attitude and result in inappropriate nose-down control inputs. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn August 24, 2012, about 2230 eastern daylight time, a Bell 407 helicopter, N407N, collided into South Holston Lake during a night departure from a river bank in Abingdon, Virginia. The airline transport pilot was fatally injured. The helicopter was substantially damaged when it impacted the water. The helicopter was registered to and operated by K-VA-T&amp;W-L Aviation LLC under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual night meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed. The flight was originating from a private field at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a witness, while boating on the lake across from the helicopter landing zone, he watched as the helicopter came in and landed. He recalled that the landing light was on, and he watched as the passengers exited the helicopter. The helicopter then lifted and turned toward the lake, descended down an embankment and made a turn over the lake. The witness said that he noticed that the landing light was not on during the departure flight. The helicopter traveled approximately 150 yards when the bottom skids began to make the water spray on the side of the helicopter. The helicopter then nosed over and made a loud splash. The witness waited for a short moment and then turned on his spot light and moved towards the position of the helicopter. As he moved towards the helicopter, his boat bumped into the tail boom, which was floating away from the fuselage. He continued towards the helicopter and came upon the helicopter floating upside down with the skids upright approximately 2 feet above the water. The witness shined his light throughout the cabin and cockpit but did not see anyone. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 64, held an airline transport pilot certificate for airplane single-engine land, multi-engine land, and rotorcraft-helicopter issued May 27, 2008, and a second-class airman medical certificate issued February 17, 2012, with limitations for corrective lenses. The pilot's logbook was not recovered for review. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records, the pilot reported 26,000 flight hours on his last medical.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the pilot's flight schedule for that day revealed that the pilot started the passenger flights at 1500 on the day of the accident. A review of the flight schedule times revealed that 10 passenger flights between Bristol Speedway to a private residence near South Holston Lake were made in a period of 1 hour and 20 minutes. After the pilot returned, he was informed that the next flight would start at 2100. During the flights, the pilot hot fueled at the landing site adjacent to the residence where he dropped off and picked up passengers. There is no record of the amount of fuel taken onboard the helicopter during the day. According to the wife of the pilot, he was well rested the night before and there was nothing abnormal about the day. She went on to say that the pilot was in good health. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe seven-seat, skid equipped helicopter, serial number 53077, was manufactured in 1996. It was powered by a Rolls-Royce model 250-C47B turbo-shaft 650-hp engine. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of copies of maintenance logbook records showed an annual inspection was completed March 20, 2012, at a recorded airframe total time of 2,339.1 hours, and an engine time of 2,091.0 hours. The Hobbs hour-meter showed 2,427.8 hours at the accident site. The engine control unit recorded an engine total time of 2,771.06. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nVideo footage from a security camera captured several daytime departures by the pilot earlier that day. In all the takeoffs, the helicopter was low enough to the surface of the lake to allow the main rotor to create a wake on the surface of the water. On the night of the accident, video footage showed the helicopter's anti-collision lights reflecting off of the lake's surface prior to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAERODROME INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe intended landing site was in the backyard at the private residence of the owner of the helicopter, which is an area of turf grass. The landing site was elevated approximately 30 feet above the lake surface. The area is unlit and not a dedicated helipad and it was used frequently by the owner for helicopter operations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of recorded data from the Virginia Highlands Airport, Abingdon, Virginia (VJI) automated weather observation station, elevation 2,087 feet, revealed that at 2235, conditions were wind 100 degrees at 4 knots, visibility of 10 miles, cloud conditions scattered at 11,000 feet above ground level (agl). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn the day of the accident, official sunset was at 2007, end of civil twilight was at 2033, moonset was at 1917 with an elevation more than 29 degrees below the horizon, and moonrise would be 1519 on August 25, 2012. Moon phase was a waxing crescent with 51% of visible disk illuminated. The evening trip took place under nighttime VFR conditions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe fuselage of the helicopter was recovered on August 28, 2012, approximately 100 yards from the estimated location of the helicopter's original impact point on the water. The helicopter's engine was torn from the fuselage and could not be located due to poor visibility in the water and the irregular bottom features which rendered the search ineffective.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the cockpit area of the fuselage revealed that it had been breached during impact. The pilot and copilot's seat pans were broken away from their respective bases and deformed. The instrument panel was dislodged from its mount and held to the fuselage by wiring. A cursory examination of the instrument panel revealed that the landing light switch was found in the \"both\" position but the landing light circuit breaker was observed in the \"out\" position (turned off). Examination of the fuselage exhibited evidence of main rotor contact. The top Plexiglas window and frame exhibited evidence of main rotor contact. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the flight controls revealed that all controls from the collective and cyclic to the vertical control tubes to the hydraulic actuators to the swash plate were intact and no notable damage was observed. The forward vertical firewall exhibited rotational witness marks from the engine to transmission shaft. Rotational witness marks were also present on the transmission shaft. The forward end of the transmission shaft remained attached to the main transmission; the K-Flex coupling on the aft end of the transmission shaft had failed in overload and was splayed outward. The main rotor mast had fractured in overload at its base but had not separated. Examination of the main transmission chip detector upper and lower was found clean of debris. The hydraulic reservoir was found full of hydraulic fluid and clean of debris.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the main rotor blades revealed that all four rotor blades were fractured consistent with a sudden stoppage. The blue, red, and green pitch change links were bent; the orange pitch change link was fractured in overload. All pitch link hardware was present, and all cotter keys were installed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom was fractured at the aft bulkhead and the fracture surfaces were consistent with a main rotor strike. Strike marks were present on both of the top of the vertical stabilizers above the tail boom and the bottom of the vertical stabilizers below the tail boom. The foreword-most 4 feet of the tail boom was not recovered. The vertical fin was not damaged, and the anti-collision light remained intact. The tail boom drive shaft was fractured at the number 3 coupling. Examination of the 90-degree gearbox revealed that the chip detector was found clean and free of debris. The 90-degree gearbox rotated with no binding or grinding. Control continuity was confirmed from the forward fracture to the tail rotor control lever upper end. The tail rotor control lever attachment point showed signs of impact damage and remnants of the arm bearing were located in the lower end of the tail cone. No anomalies were found with the tail rotor which would have prevented normal operation and control. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine bay showed evidence of contact by the main rotor. The mounts, engine controls, fuel, oil and electrical connections were all severed from the helicopter. The only engine components present were the Engine Control Unit (ECU), part of a throttle control arm, and a small fragment of the starter/generator mount. All engine mounts were fractured in overload and deformed. The engine oil reservoir, oil cooler, and fan were missing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to extensive impact damage, control continuity could not be established from the cockpit to the engine bay. The collective was fractured at its base. The throttle twist grip was deformed and not movable by hand. The throttle was found in the full-open (fly) position. A piece of the throttle engine's throttle arm was present in the engine bay, still attached to a deformed section of throttle control linkage. The airframe-mounted fuel filter was present. The outlet fuel line to the engine had been severed, allowing water contamination of the filter bowl. The filter bowl was opened and examined. A small amount of silt was present, from the river bed but the filter was otherwise normal. The ECU baseplate was deformed due to impact damage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was performed on the pilot on August 28, 2012, by the Department of Health, Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, Roanoke, Virginia, as authorized by the medical examiner for Washington County.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Civil Aerospace Medical Institute performed forensic toxicology on specimens from the pilot with negative results for drugs and alcohol. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTEST AND RESEARCH &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the recorded ECU data revealed that there were no engine operating exceedance prior to impact, and no accumulated engine faults were recorded during the previous engine run. No Incident recorder (IR) data had been written to file; however, a partial Snapshot trigger dataset had been recorded. The Snapshot trigger was caused by an Engine Torque Exceedance of 116%. Only seven sequential engine parameters were recorded in the Snapshot data. This is consistent with destruction of the helicopter occurring almost immediately after the initial over-torque event occurred. Electrical power was lost to the ECU before a full line of Snapshot data could be written or any IR data could be recorded. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDue to the limited amount of data recorded on the ECU, very little analysis of engine performance could be achieved. The disparity between main rotor rpm (Nr) and power turbine speed (Np) is attributable to the rapid deceleration of the main rotor as it impacted the water. There is a 24 millisecond cycle time for the data write; however, the Nr signal first passes through a digital converter before the Np signal. During a rapid deceleration of the main rotor, the recorded value for Np will be lower than that recorded for Nr. The recorded Nr data was sampled a few milliseconds before the recorded Np data. The Np data was recorded during or immediately following the main rotor strike of the water.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSpatial Disorientation&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to Spatial Disorientation in Aviation (F.H. Previc and W.R. Ercoline), the otoliths (tiny organs of the inner ear), sense the acceleration of gravity and the acceleration associated with translational motions. Because the otoliths cannot distinguish between these two types of acceleration, they can only sense a combination of these two forces, the gravitoinertial force (GIF) vector. During coordinated, unaccelerated flight, the GIF vector is directed straight down through the pilot's seat. When an aircraft accelerates rapidly, however, the GIF vector is displaced aft, causing a false sensation of pitching up. This misperception, known as the somatogravic illusion, is normally dispelled when the pilot views the external horizon and/or the flight instruments. If no external horizon is visible and the flight instruments are not continuously monitored or are not correctly interpreted, the somatogravic illusion can persist, leading to an inaccurate understanding of aircraft orientation and direction of motion known as spatial disorientation, a condition that can lead to inappropriate pilot control inputs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSpatial disorientation illusions are described extensively in FAA pilot training literature. For example, the 2012 Aeronautical Information Manual states, \"A rapid acceleration during takeoff can create the illusion of being in a nose up attitude.\" Similarly, the FAA Instrument Flying Handbook states, \"A rapid acceleration, such as experienced during takeoff, stimulates the otolith organs in the same way as tilting the head backwards. This action creates the somatogravic illusion of being in a nose-up attitude, especially in situations without good visual references.\" The Manual and the Handbook warn that, \"The disoriented pilot may push the aircraft into a nose-low or dive attitude.\" Identical information is included in the FAA's Pilot Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge. This particular illusion is so well recognized that information about it is included in the FAA's private pilot, instrument rating, and airline transport pilot knowledge test guides and the FAA practical test standards for private pilots. &#x0D;\nAccording to FAA Advisory Circular AC 60-4A, \"Pilot's Spatial Disorientation,\" tests conducted with qualified instrument pilots indicated that it can take as long as 35 seconds to establish full control by instruments after a loss of visual reference of the earth's surface. AC 60-4A further states that surface references and the natural horizon may become obscured even though visibility may be above VFR minimums, and that an inability to perceive the natural horizon or surface references is common during flights over water, at night, in sparsely populated areas, and in low-visibility conditions. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The pilot was transporting personnel from a remote elevated helipad constructed of logs. Witnesses stated that the helicopter had just touched down, and the pilot turned his head to give the signal to board when the helicopter suddenly pitched up and back, striking trees at the edge of the helipad. The helicopter rolled down the hill.  A postaccident examination of the helipad revealed that one of the logs that made up the rear portion of the helipad decking had been pulled from the structure and damaged.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on the lack of mechanical anomalies with the helicopter and the damage to the helipad decking, it is likely the pilot landed too far forward on the helipad, which allowed the tail of the left skid to fall into the open area between the logs and become entangled.

    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn August 7, 2012, about 1645 Alaska daylight time, a McDonnell Douglas MD600N helicopter, N737TV, sustained substantial damage while landing on a remote helipad near Pogo Mine, 38 miles Northeast of Delta Junction, Alaska. The helicopter was being operated by Aurora Aviation Services, Inc., Delta Junction, as a 14 CFR Part 135 visual flight rules (VFR) on-demand charter flight when the accident occurred. The certificated airline transport pilot was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and company flight following was in effect. The flight departed from the Pogo Mine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter had been based at Pogo Mine since May, 2012. Its primary purpose was to support exploratory gold mining operations, by transporting personnel and equipment to remote drilling sites. Remote helipads were constructed at numerous drilling sites to provide improvised landing platforms. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe remote helipad at Rig 3 was located approximately 1 mile southeast of the Pogo Mine runway, in an area of steep, heavily forested terrain, at an elevation of about 2,700 feet MSL. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helipad was constructed of logs interlaced and nailed together to provide an improvised landing platform. The platform was approximately 16 feet wide by 21 feet long. The logs forming the platform deck were placed only at the forward and aft section of the log frame. With two logs, approximately 8 inches in diameter forming the forward platform deck, followed by approximately 4 feet of open space, then a single 6 inch diameter log, followed by approximately 8 feet of open space, and then 4 logs, about 6 inches in diameter forming the rear platform deck. Large boulders were placed under the framework at various locations to support the platform. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe day of the accident the pilot had flown several missions into numerous helipads, and conducted several sling load operations. He was returning to the helipad at Rig 3 to transport personnel back to the mine.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring an on-scene interview with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) on August 8, a witness reported that just before the accident he radioed the pilot to request a pickup at the remote helipad located at Rig 3. He was kneeling beside the helipad when the helicopter touched down. He said the pilot turned his head to give the signal to board, when suddenly the helicopter pitched up and back, striking trees at the edge of the helipad. The helicopter rolled down the hill, and came to rest on its left side. The engine was still running when the witness arrived on-scene.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a separate on-scene interview with the NTSB IIC on August 8, another witness working in the vicinity heard the helicopter land at the helipad, followed shortly thereafter by a loud screeching noise and impact. After the accident, while running past the helipad en-route to the accident scene, he noticed a log on the rear left side of the helipad that was displaced upwards. He noted that the long spike that attaches the log to the foundation was pulled out, and the log was displaced aft.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a separate on-scene interview with the NTSB IIC on August 8, another witness working approximately 500 feet northwest of the accident site, reported hearing the helicopter land, followed by a tremendous crash, and debris flying in the air. On his way past the helipad, to render aid, he observed one of the logs that made up the rear portion of the helipad decking had been pulled from the structure and was damaged. He also reported that on several previous occasions, he had observed the pilot land forward on the remote helipad, allowing the tail of the landing gear skids to fall into the open area of the platform decking. The pilot would then reposition the helicopter up and aft so the tails of the landing gear skids came to rest on top of the four logs that formed the rear portion of the helipad.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA post mortem examination was conducted under the authority of the Alaska state Medical Examiner, Anchorage, Alaska, on August 9, 2012. The cause of death for the pilot was attributed to blunt force, traumatic injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Civil Aeromedical Institute performed toxicology examinations for the pilot on September 28, 2012, which was negative for alcohol and drugs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn August 8, two NTSB investigators, along with two FAA aviation safety inspectors from the Fairbanks Flight Standards District Office (FSDO), and a representative from Aurora Aviation Services Inc. examined the wreckage at the accident site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was configured for left seat flight control operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll of the helicopters major components were found at the main wreckage site. The accident site was in an area of steep, heavily forested terrain at an elevation of about 2,700 feet mean sea level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main debris path was on approximately a 200 degree heading, and downhill (All headings/ bearings noted in this report are magnetic).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nScattered downslope in a line from the initial impact point, and the final resting point of the main wreckage, were small portions of wreckage debris, broken Plexiglass, and personal effects. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter fuselage and passenger cabin was lying on its left side with the nose oriented to the southeast.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cockpit was severely damaged with extensive deformation. The canopy was segmented and separated with all canopy glass windscreens and overhead transparencies shattered or missing. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft cabin and passenger compartment was slightly bent and buckled inward along the upper roof area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe right hand fore and aft landing gear struts fractured at the foot assemblies where the strut attaches to the landing gear skid. The right hand landing gear skid was located on the left side, and just aft of the main wreckage site. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe left hand forward landing gear strut fractured at the foot assembly, the aft landing gear strut remained attached to the landing gear skid. The left hand landing gear skid fractured just aft of the front foot assembly and was located uphill of the main wreckage site.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe NOTAR tail boom assembly was severed just aft of the tail boom attach points. The tail boom came to rest upright, with the aft portion of the boom pointing towards the fuselage. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe MD 600N helicopter has six all metal main rotor blades. Each main rotor blade is color coded for easy identification. Each main rotor blade is attached to the main rotor hub by means of a strap pack assembly.  The accident helicopter’s yellow and black blades stayed attached to the main rotor hub assembly. The red blade separated when the pitch housing and strap pack assembly was torn from the main rotor hub assembly. The blue, white and green blades were fractured at the blade root just outboard of the doublers. All blades exhibited damage consistent with sudden stoppage associated with multiple ground and tree strikes while under power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNo evidence of preimpact mechanical anomalies was found.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 64, held an airline transport pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating, and held commercial pilot privileges for airplane single-engine land. He also held a type rating for a Eurocopter/MBB BO-105 helicopter. His most recent second-class medical was issued on April 2, 2012, with the limitation that he must wear corrective lenses.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the Pilot/Operator Aircraft Accident Report, (NTSB Form 6120.1) submitted by Aurora Aviation Services Inc., the pilot’s total aeronautical experience was about 19,500 flight hours, of which about 306 were in the accident helicopter make and model. In the preceding 90 and 30 days prior to the accident, the pilot flew a total of 306 and 100 flight hours.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe operator’s pilot training records showed no deficiencies, and that the accident pilot had completed all required training, including a required CFR Part 135 VFR competency check ride on May 12, 2012, that was observed by a FAA aviation safety inspector. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was a 1997 model year, McDonnell Douglas 600N, equipped with a Rolls Royce M250-C47M engine. According to the operators records, at the time of the accident the helicopter had about 9,730 flight hours. The most recent annual inspection of the airframe and engine was completed on April 1, 2012. The last recorded inspection of the engine and airframe was a 100-hour inspection, completed on July 13, 2012, about 90 hours before the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe aft most section of the landing gear skids were fitted with Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) “Bear Paws”. The Bear Paws are constructed of high strength polymer, are attached to the rear of the landing gear skids and provide a 19 inch wide footprint to aid in landing on soft or uneven terrain. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn examination of the helicopter’s maintenance logs showed no mechanical discrepancies. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe closest weather reporting facility is Allen Army Airfield, approximately 41 miles southwest of the accident site.  About 20 minutes after the accident, at 1653, an aviation routine weather report (METAR) at Allen Army Airfield, Ft. Greely, Alaska, reported in part, wind from 310 degrees, at 13 knots, gusting to 21 knots, visibility, 10 statute miles, scattered clouds at 7,000 feet, scattered clouds at 20,000 feet, temperature, 65 degrees F; dew point 7, degrees F; altimeter, 29.84 inHG.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered from the accident site and transported to Alaska Claims Services, Inc., in Wasilla, Alaska. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn September 5, 2012 a wreckage exam and layout was done under the direction of the NTSB IIC. Also present was an air safety investigator from MD Helicopters, Inc., an air safety investigator from The Boeing Company, and an air safety investigator from Rolls-Royce Corporation. During the examination, no preaccident airframe or engine anomalies were noted. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGarmin GPS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the pilot was using a Garmin GPSMAP 496 portable global positioning system (GPS) receiver, capable of storing route-of-flight data. The unit was sent to the NTSB’s Vehicle Recorders Division for examination. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA NTSB electrical engineer was able to extract the GPS data for the accident flight, which included, in part, time, latitude, longitude, and GPS altitude. Groundspeed and course information were derived from the extracted parameters. A flight track map overlay, and tabular data corresponding to the accident flight are available in the public docket for this accident. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "During an instructional flight, the student pilot reported that the instructor was demonstrating a “fast landing” approach to a hill. The instructor subsequently positioned the helicopter in a 3- to 4-foot hover above the ground and heading into the wind, then initiated a left pedal turn and started to lift off. The student stated that the helicopter suddenly rolled rapidly to the right and the main rotor blades contacted the ground, which resulted in a rollover.  A postaccident examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of mechanical malfunctions or failures that would have precluded normal operation.  The terrain surrounding the accident site was covered with sporadic patches of sagebrush ranging from 1 to 4 feet high.  It is likely that the helicopter contacted brush as the pilot performed the left hovering turn, which resulted in a dynamic rollover.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn July 9, 2012, about 1015 Pacific daylight time, a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter, N7527Y, impacted terrain following a loss of control while hovering at an off field landing site near Murrieta, California. The flight instructor was fatally injured and his student was not injured. The helicopter was substantially damaged. The helicopter was being operated by USA Academy of Aviation, Inc., under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. A flight plan had not been filed for the local instructional flight, which originated from French Valley Airport, Murrieta, about 0900. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the accident. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe student reported that they were practicing off field landings. According to the student, the instructor pointed toward a hill and explained that he would demonstrate a “fast landing” approach. The instructor flew toward the hill at about 50 knots, flared to slow the helicopter, and came to a hover at the center of the hill top. The instructor hovered at 3 to 4 feet above the ground heading south into the wind, performed a left pedal turn to the east and then started to lift off. At this point, the helicopter rolled rapidly to the right, and the main rotor blades hit the ground. When the helicopter came to rest, it was lying on its left side. The student exited the helicopter and found that the instructor was trapped beneath the fuselage and was not responsive. The student reported that he was not on the flight controls when the accident occurred. He did not report any preimpact mechanical discrepancies or anomalies with the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 61-year-old flight instructor, seated in the left seat, held a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft helicopter rating, and a flight instructor certificate with a rotorcraft helicopter rating. His most recent Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) second-class medical certificate was issued on September 6, 2011. At that time, he reported that he had a total flight time of 10,625 hours and had flown 251 hours in the preceding 6 months.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe student, seated in the right seat, held a private pilot certificate with an airplane single-engine land rating. His most recent FAA third-class medical certificate was issued on December 13, 2010. At that time, he reported that he had a total flight time of 80 hours and had flown 20 hours in the preceding 6 months. The student reported that he started working with the flight instructor to obtain his rotorcraft helicopter rating about 1 week before the accident, and they had flown together about 15 hours. He further reported that he had not yet soloed in the helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe single engine two person helicopter was manufactured in 2004 by the Robinson Helicopter Company. It was equipped with a two-bladed main rotor system, a two-bladed tail rotor, and skid-type landing gear. The helicopter had a maximum takeoff weight of 1,370 pounds and a useful load capacity of about 575 pounds. The helicopter was powered by a Lycoming O-360-J2A four cylinder, horizontally opposed, normally aspirated, air cooled engine. This engine was designed to produce 145 horsepower at sea level. A review of the helicopter’s maintenance logbooks revealed its most recent 100-hour inspection was completed on March 11, 2012, at a recording hour meter time of 2,100 hours and a total time of 4,266.5 hours. The helicopter’s recording hour meter showed 2,199.6 hours at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the maintenance records revealed no evidence of any uncorrected maintenance discrepancies.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt 1055, the automated weather observing system at March Air Reserve Base, Riverside, California, located about 22 miles northwest of the accident site, reported wind from 330 degrees at 7 knots; clear sky, visibility 10 miles; temperature 34 degrees Celsius; dew point minus 4 degrees Celsius; and an altimeter setting of 29.97 inches.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn automated weather station (ME2644) in Hemet, California, located about 12 miles north of the accident site, reported the following:&#x0D;\nTime\tWind Direction\tWind Speed&#x0D;\n0959\tNorthwest\t1.0 mph&#x0D;\n1004\tNorthwest\t2.3 mph&#x0D;\n1009\tCalm\t\t0 mph&#x0D;\n1014\tCalm\t\t0 mph&#x0D;\n1019\tNorthwest\t2.0 mph&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was examined by a FAA inspector and a representative from the Robinson Helicopter Company at the accident site on the day of the accident, and again on July 19, 2012, at the facilities of Robinson Helicopter Company in Torrance, California. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on its left side with the nose on a heading of about 090 degrees, positioned 10 to 12 feet southeast of the top of a hill. The surface was loose dirt over rock. The area had sporadic patches of sagebrush ranging from 1 to 4 feet high.  The main rotor mast was bent and disconnected about 6 inches above the gearbox, and the main rotor system, with the exception of the outboard section of one main rotor blade, was lying next to the fuselage. There were ground scars directly under the helicopter and one about 17 feet south of the fuselage, which was consistent in appearance with a main rotor blade tip strike.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe intact main rotor blade was bent upward about 3 feet from the hub, bent upward and back (in the direction of rotation) near the tip, and displayed chordwise creases near the tip. The other main rotor blade was separated about 3 feet from the hub, and the majority of the separated section of the blade was found about 135 feet from the fuselage. This blade was bent back at the tip and displayed chordwise creases throughout its length.&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nBoth tail rotor blades were disconnected near the hub. One had a small dent in its leading edge, and the other displayed chordwise scuff marks. The tail rotor output shaft rotated smoothly, and the tail rotor flight controls had continuity throughout.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nNeither door was installed. The left side windshield was shattered, and the right side windshield was separated from the cabin. There was a large scuff mark on the chin to the left of the landing lights. The left door frame and roof section were distorted due to impact.  The cowling around the main rotor mast was dented and deformed consistent with contact with the main rotor mast. The upper stabilizer was damaged near the tip and bent midway consistent with ground contact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the cyclic and collective flight controls revealed no evidence of any preimpact malfunctions or failures. The surfaces of the separated control tubes were angular and jagged consistent with separation as a result of overload. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was examined on July 19, 2012, and no visible damage was noted. The lower spark plugs were removed, the engine was rotated by hand, and good thumb suction and compression were obtained on all cylinders. The plugs were reinstalled, and the engine was started. It ran slightly rough for the first few minutes but after it warmed up, it ran smooth at idle and at 100% rpm. A magneto check was performed at 75% rpm, which resulted in an 8% rpm drop on the left magneto and a 12% rpm drop on the right magneto. Oil pressure and temperature were normal.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was performed on the flight instructor on July 10, 2012, by the Office of the Riverside County Sheriff-Coroner. The report identified the cause of death as craniocerebral trauma. The flight instructor and the student pilot were not wearing helmets, nor was this required. The helicopter was equipped with a combined seat belt/single-strap shoulder harness (similar to the type commonly installed in automobiles) for each occupant, and the student reported that both he and the instructor were using them.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nForensic toxicology testing was performed on specimens from the flight instructor at the FAA’s Bioaeronautical Sciences Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The tests were negative for all screened substances. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The helicopter was reported missing by family members, and the wreckage was found the next day in a deep river canyon abutted by 200-foot vertical cliffs. Before the accident, a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) cableway system had spanned the river about 300 feet north of the wreckage and had been elevated about 39 feet above the river's center. Examination of the cable, its landing platforms, the helicopter, and the wreckage location revealed evidence consistent with the helicopter impacting the cable while traveling in level-forward flight. A photo of the cableway taken by the USGS before the accident showed that the cable suspended over the river was not visible against the terrain background; however, the cableway did not meet the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aerial marker requirement criteria. The USGS has replaced the cableway with aerial markers. In addition, the accident occurred within a designated Special Conservation Area, which the FAA recommends avoiding, if practical, or if flown through, it recommends that pilots should make every effort to fly not less than 2,000 feet above ground level.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot's postaccident ethanol levels were indicative of the ethanol being produced postmortem; if any of the ethanol was due to ingestion, it was well below the FAA regulatory limit, and it is unlikely to have contributed to the accident. The pilot's postaccident diphenhydramine level suggests that he had taken it within an hour of taking off. Diphenhydramine causes marked sedation, is a central nervous system depressant, and it has been observed to alter mood and impair cognitive and psychomotor performance. It is likely that diphenhydramine led to cognitive and psychomotor impairment to the pilot and contributed to his decision to fly at an insufficient altitude in a river canyon.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn June 30, 2012, at 1207 Pacific daylight time, a Eurocopter AS350BA, N729DP, was flying low through the Verde River canyon approximately 8.6 miles south of Camp Verde, Arizona, and struck a cable that spanned the river at a narrow portion of the canyon/gorge. The helicopter was registered to Chopper II LLC, and operated by the private pilot under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 91. The pilot and three passengers were fatally injured, and the helicopter was substantially damaged. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan had been filed. The flight originated from Scottsdale Airport, Scottsdale, Arizona, around 0825.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was reported missing on June 30th by concerned family members and the wreckage was located July 1st. The helicopter was laying on its right side in 4-5 feet of water in the center of the Verde River. Vertical cliffs extend up from the river bed about 200 feet on both the eastern and western sides of the river. Approximately 300 feet north of the wreckage was a USGS streamgaging cableway system that spanned the river, and was elevated 39 feet above the river. The steel cable was found severed and the cable carriage located on the landing platform deformed. The cable ends were flayed consistent with overload, and the cable end located on the eastern shore had grey paint that matched the color of the rotor blades and composite rotor blade fibers were imbedded in the cable strands at the severed cable end.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRadar records indicate that the helicopter departed Scottsdale Airport, around 0830. A mobile phone location search was conducted by the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) while searching for the helicopter. One of the phones serviced by Verizon that was in the possession of one of the helicopter's occupants provided a significant amount of recorded location activity. The phone record indicated that between 0912 and 1101 location activity was concentrated in the vicinity of the Sedona Airport and the town of Sedona. Between 1110 and 1142, there was location activity recorded 7 miles north of Sedona. Between 1152 and 1158, there was location activity near Montezuma Castle National Monument. Finally, between 1200 and 1207 there was location activity south of Camp Verde, near the accident location. There was no activity recorded after 1207. A Park Ranger at the Montezuma Castle National Monument reported that at 1155 she observed a helicopter with the numbers N729DP on the tail orbit the castle at a low altitude then depart towards Camp Verde.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe five seat, conventionally configured, single-engine helicopter, serial number 2338, was manufactured in 1990. It was powered by a Turbomeca Arriel 1B 478 KW engine. Review of airframe and engine maintenance logbook showed that an annual inspection was completed on February 10, 2012, at a total aircraft time of 7,342.4 hours; engine total time of 10,658.4 hours; hobbs meter reading of 7,342.4 hours. Installation of 2 Data Toys DT-CAM-WDR600 cameras and recording system was completed on April 26, 2012. The most recent maintenance on the helicopter consisted of air conditioning system maintenance, and tail boom to fuselage junction torque check (AD 2001-04-14) completed on June 25, 2012. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot, age 70, held a private pilot certificate with ratings for airplane single-engine and multiengine land, instrument airplane, and rotorcraft-helicopter issued on February 22, 2008, and a third-class, special issuance medical certificate with the limitation that he must have glasses for near vision, issued June 9, 2011, and not valid for any class after December 31, 2012. The pilot reported a total flight time of 4,500 hours on his medical application. The pilot's logbook that was examined by investigators recorded the pilot's helicopter flight time starting in August 2006. The logbook indicated that the pilot had 1,734.2 hours of helicopter time, 416.9 hours in the AS350 model of helicopter, and his most recent logbook entry was on February 19, 2012, where he listed the helicopter hobbs time as 7,347.3 hours. The pilot's most recent flight review was conducted on March 28, 2011. Flight time for the 90 days preceding the accident was zero.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was located in the center of the Verde River, on its right side in about 4-5 feet of water. The main rotor and transmission had separated as a single unit, and was located approximately 70 feet to the east of the fuselage. The tail boom had separated at the fuselage-tail splice, and rotated downward relative to the helicopter, but remained adjacent to the fuselage. The engine remained with the fuselage. The rear passenger and front passenger seats had separated from the cabin, however, the pilot's seat remained attached to the cabin deck. The oil cooler fairing and fuselage belly fairing were located approximately 500-600 feet north of the main fuselage.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe main rotor blades remained attached to the starflex rotor hub. The tips of the red and yellow rotor blades had separated about 3 feet inboard from the blade tips. The blade tip separation occurred along the chord line for both blades. Both blades had witness marks on their leading edges at the point of separation consistent with that of a steel cable. The transmission had separated from its support mounts, and the fracture surfaces contained 45-degree shear lips with a bright granular surface consistent with overload. Transmission drive train continuity was established by moving the rotor head and observing movement of the engine to transmission drive coupling. The engine to transmission drive shaft was not located.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHelicopter flight control rods were continuous from the cockpit cyclic and collective controls up to the transmission deck. Control pitch change links and servos remained attached to the swash plate and transmission structure. Control rod ends were attached to the control servos. The blue pitch change link was separated in overload at the lower rod end, and the yellow pitch change link exhibited a cable witness mark at mid length. The tail rotor drive shaft had separated aft of the number 2 hanger bearing near the tail boom splice, and was continuous to the tail rotor gear box. The tail rotor control rods were continuous from the tail rotor servo aft to the tail rotor. The tail rotor hub, pitch links, and paddles were present and connected on the hub.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was attached to the engine deck mounts. The gas generator turned freely by hand. The throttle and anticipator cables were securely connected, as were all the fuel and oil lines. Both electric chip detectors were clean. The free turbine rotated by hand, no blade shedding had occurred, and continuity was confirmed from the tower gear and accessory gear train, and from the turbine to the reduction gearbox and the power shaft. Both the Ng (gas producer turbine) and NTL (free turbine) drives were intact and could be moved by hand on the fuel control unit (FCU). Fuel was observed in the main fuel line. The Module 5 (reduction gearbox) was removed and approximately 1 mm of misalignment on the input pinion nut was observed, an indication of an over torque condition, which is consistent with engine being driven during an impact of the main rotor. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe cable that spanned the river was approximately 1 inch in diameter, and determined by the USGS to be 286 feet in length. The cable ends where the cable had separated were flayed, and the cable stands ends were bright and shiny consistent with recent damage. The cable length that remained on the eastern shore line was approximately 130 feet long, and the cable that remained on the western shore line was approximately 140 feet long. A steel platform with an aluminum carriage was located on the western side. The aluminum carriage was bent and deformed.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFLIGHT RECORDERS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was equipped with a DataToys, Ultimate Digital Video Platform (UDVP) video recorder and two lipstick style DT-CAM-WDR600 cameras. An SD memory card was removed from the UDVP recorder and sent to the NTSB Vehicle Recorder Laboratory for data extraction. The Vehicle Recorder Laboratory reported that the video imagery that was downloaded from the SD card did not match the terrain that was in the vicinity of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPATHOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the FAA certified medical file, this 70-year-old pilot first received medical certification in 1974. He continued to be routinely certified through 2004, and reported no significant medical conditions or medications to the FAA during this time. In 2004, the pilot developed chest pain, and after a medical evaluation, underwent four vessel coronary artery bypass grafting for severe coronary artery disease. At that time, hypertension and hyperlipidemia were also diagnosed. The pilot applied for medical certification in 2006; after review of his medical condition, treatment, and test results, the pilot received a special issuance medical certification. Thereafter, the pilot received annual special issuance medical certification in the third class. His last medical certification exam was performed on 6/9/2011 and his special issuance was granted through 12/31/2012. The pilot reported using Toprol (metoprolol, a beta-blocker used to treat hypertension and prevent infarction in patients with coronary artery disease) and Lipitor (atorvastatin, a cholesterol lowering agent) to the FAA beginning in 2006.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe FAA's Forensic Toxicology Research Team CAMI performed forensic toxicology on specimens from the pilot. Toxicology testing revealed several alcohols in multiple tissues. Ethanol was identified in heart (0.083 gm/dL), brain (0.046 gm/dL), and blood (0.043 gm/dL) and amounts too small to quantify of n-butanol and n-propanol were found in heart and blood. In addition, acetaminophen (an analgesic marketed under the trade name Tylenol) was detected in blood, metoprolol (a beta-blocker marketed under the trade name Toprol) was found in liver and blood, and diphenhydramine (a sedating antihistamine and sleep aid marketed over the counter under the trade names Benadryl and Unisom) was discovered in liver and blood (0.1ug/ml).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was performed on the pilot on July 3, 2012, by the Yavapai County Medical Examiner, Prescott, Arizona. The medical examiner found the cause of death to be blunt force injuries and the manner of death to be accident. Evidence of coronary artery disease and the previous coronary artery bypass procedure was also identified. No other natural disease was described.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRSPACE INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident occurred in a Special Conservation Area that is marked on the Phoenix Sectional Aeronautical Chart. The Special Conservation Area is depicted by a cyan line with a single row of dots on the inside of the prescribed area. Special Conservation Areas include National Parks, Wildlife Refuges, and Primitive and Wilderness Areas. FAA Advisory Circular 91-36, Visual Flight Rules (VFR) Flight Near Noise-Sensitive Areas, lists a number of voluntary practices for a pilot to exercise as a practical indication of concern for the environment. AC 91-36 recommends the avoidance of noise sensitive areas if practical, or to make every effort to fly not less than 2,000 feet above ground level (agl) defined as the highest terrain within 2,000 feet laterally of the route of flight or the uppermost rim of a canyon or valley.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe USGS Bureau of Aviation provided photos of the streamgaging station that were taken to document the station and cableway, and were taken sometime well before the accident. The USGS Bureau Aviation Manager states that the photos clearly shows that the cable could not be seen against the background terrain of the river and rock canyon. -",

    "FactualNarrative": "On June 12, 2012, at 1520 Pacific daylight time, a Robinson Helicopter Company R44 II, N282MC, collided with a power line in East Wenatchee, Washington. The helicopter was owned by Reed Helicopters, and operated by Dragonfly Aviation, LLC, through a contract with JR Helicopters, LLC, under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91. The helicopter sustained substantial damage. The commercial pilot sustained serious injuries and the pilot rated passenger was fatally injured. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed.According to the operator, the helicopter was on a 30-day contract to dry cherries and the contract had been arranged through JR Helicopters. The operator reported that the helicopter was not equipped with dual controls.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDuring a telephone interview, the pilot stated that the pilot rated passenger was a newer employee and had come out to watch the flying pilot work the orchard. The passenger asked if he could go up on a flight. The flying pilot stated that it wasn't typical, but there was nothing prohibiting it, so he took the passenger with him on the accident flight to show him the ropes. The flying pilot stated that he did not recall the accident, but that there was nothing wrong with the helicopter prior to lift off, and transition to forward flight.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA witness, who lived next to the orchard, watched the helicopter as it flew. She reported that the helicopter was flying in a southerly direction. As the helicopter made a steep left turn, the main rotor impacted a power line and the helicopter descended into a tree.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA postaccident airframe and engine examination revealed that rotation signatures were identified on the fanwheel and clutch assemblies. The engine spark plugs were removed and normal wear signatures were noted. Engine cylinder compression was established by covering the lower spark plug holes with a finger. Flight control continuity was established. The flight control servos were removed and visually appeared normal. The two hydraulic servo's (actuators) were subsequently disassembled and the hydraulic fluid remaining was captured. At the conclusion of the examination, no mechanical malfunctions or failures were revealed that would have precluded normal operation. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The commercial pilot was attempting to land his single-engine helicopter on a fixed production platform helipad when the main rotor blades struck the corner of an oil derrick that was partially positioned over the helipad. The pilot lost control and descended inverted into the ocean. The emergency external floats were not inflated, and the helicopter sank. At the time of the accident, a mobile jack-up rig was mated with the fixed production platform. According to the company that owned the production platform, the helipad was closed and all flight operations were being conducted from the jack-up rig’s helipad, which was larger and unobstructed. However, at the time of the accident, the production platform’s helipad was not marked closed and no notice to airman (NOTAM) had been issued to notify pilots that the helipad was closed. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was also nothing in the operator’s flight operations manual that would have restricted the pilot from landing under an obstruction. Other company pilots were aware that this helipad was a flight hazard due to the encroachment of the oil derrick, but it was never reported to management or via the company’s internal safety notification system. A review of company flight manifest records revealed that the pilot had flown to this platform on several occasions, including 2 days before the accident, and landed on the jack-up rig’s helipad. It could not be determined why the pilot decided to land on the smaller and obstructed helipad rather than the jack up rig’s larger helipad just 2 days later.  Examination of the helicopter and engine revealed no preimpact mechanical failures or malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn May 28, 2012, approximately 1610 central daylight time, a Bell 206-L4 helicopter, N7077F, was substantially damaged when it collided with the Ensco 99 oil rig derrick while on approach to the South Timbalier (ST67B) production platform in the Gulf of Mexico. The commercial pilot, who was the only occupant, was fatally injured. The helicopter was registered to and operated by PHI INC, Lafayette, Louisiana. A company visual flight rules flight plan was filed for the flight that originated from its base in Grand Isle, Louisiana, at 1514, and was destined for the Mississippi Canyon (MC397) and ST67B oil platforms. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the on-demand offshore flight conducted under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 135.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to PHI INC flight manifest records, the pilot landed at MC397 at 1541, dropped off a box, and then departed for the ST67B platform at 1543 to pick up a passenger.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe ST67B production platform was a permanent structure equipped with a 24-foot-long by 24-foot-wide helipad with a 3-foot-wide solid safety fence.  At the time of the accident, the Ensco 99 mobile jack-up oil rig was connected on the north side of the ST67B platform. The Ensco 99 rig, which was being operated by Ensco for Energy XXI, was equipped with a 65-foot diameter helipad.  At the time of the accident, the Ensco 99’s oil derrick was positioned over the ST67B helipad by about seven feet and was supposedly closed due to this encroachment.  Flight operations were being conducted to/from the Ensco 99 helipad.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn an interview, a witness, who was the passenger waiting to be picked up by the helicopter, stated he was standing on the Ensco 99 rig near the helipad when he heard a public announcement for a “Green deck on 67B.” Then he heard someone respond, “Green deck 67B.”  The witness watched the helicopter circle the rig and then he headed toward the Ensco 99 helipad.  When the helicopter did not approach the Ensco 99 helipad, he looked over the side of the rig and saw the helicopter approaching the ST67B helipad instead. The witness said the pilot’s approach was slow and steady, and the helicopter was moving forward the entire time. There were numerous workers trying to wave the pilot off from landing. The witness remembered thinking to himself, “There was no way [the pilot] could land there.”  He then saw the main rotor blades hit the side of the rig and the engine revved up.  The witness said the helicopter either backed out or lost control, because it came back up and the main rotor blades struck the rig a second time.  Then the tail rotor struck the helipad and the entire helicopter fell back into the water.  The witness said he ran over to the ST67B platform and saw life rings in the water. He could still see the helicopter, but it was sinking quickly.  A life boat was also being lowered into the water by the crew stationed on the the Alliance I lift boat. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Alliance I lift boat was stationed at the southeast corner of the two rigs. The boat was staffed with a captain and a first mate, who both witnessed the accident. According to the captain, he was in his office on the boat when he heard the helicopter approaching. He got alarmed because the noise of the helicopter was so loud and he thought the ST67B helipad was closed. The captain watched the helicopter approach the pad and he could see a worker on the Ensco 99 rig trying to wave the pilot off from landing. Due to the relatively close proximity of the helicopter to the boat, the captain thought he saw the pilot trying to \"pull back”, but “it was too late\", and the main rotor blades struck the southeast corner of the oil derrick. The helicopter then spun rapidly and the tail boom separated from the fuselage. The helicopter descended into the water inverted. The captain immediately sounded the general alarm. The emergency floats on the helicopter were not deployed and the helicopter began to sink. In less than a minute, a rescue boat was in the water but the helicopter had already sunk from view below the surface of the water. The captain said this was the first time he had seen someone try to land on the ST67B helipad. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe first mate said he was in the boat’s wheelhouse when he heard the helicopter approaching. He looked outside the window and saw the skids of the helicopter going by. He was concerned because he thought the ST67B helipad was closed due to the oil derrick’s position over the helipad. The first mate was watching a person on the Ensco 99 rig trying to wave the pilot off from continuing the approach when he heard a “pop, pop, pop” noise. At that moment, he knew the main rotor blades had struck the base of the oil derrick. When he looked back at the helicopter, it had spun around suddenly and he thought the tail rotor struck the helipad. He said, “The helicopter jumped violently and the tail seemed to fold and the chopper fell along the northeast side of the platform.” The first mate then assisted the captain and other parties in an attempt to rescue the pilot. The first mate said that he has never seen a pilot try to land on the ST67B helipad prior to the accident. &#x0D;\nAnother witness was working on the north side of the oil derrick when he heard the helicopter make two passes around the oil rig. He then heard the helicopter approaching the ST67B helipad and it sounded \"normal.\"  Shortly after, the witness heard the main rotor blades impact the base of the oil derrick (rig floor). The witness then rushed down a set of stairs on the east side of the rig floor and looked over the railing. At that point, the tail boom had separated from the fuselage, and both sections were descending into the water. The witness said he had been stationed on the Ensco 99 rig for approximately four months and this was the first time he had seen a helicopter try to land on the ST67B helipad.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot was hired by PHI INC on January 5, 2012. On January 18, 2012, he successfully completed ground school and flight training in the Bell 206 helicopter and was assigned to PHI INC’s base in Grand Isle, Louisiana.  He also successfully completed water survival training on January 14, 2012.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe pilot held a commercial pilot certificate for rotorcraft-helicopter, and instrument helicopter. His last Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) First Class medical certificate was issued July 18, 2011. A review of company records and also one of the pilot’s logbooks, revealed he had accrued approximately 1,645.1 hours; of which 363 hours were in Bell 206-L3/4 model helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe week before the accident, the pilot completed transition training in the Bell 407 helicopter and successfully passed an FAA Part 135 airman competency/proficiency check ride on May 24, 2012.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of company flight manifest records revealed the pilot had been dispatched to ST67B on several occasions. His most recent trip occurred just two days before the accident on May 26, 2012. According to the passenger he flew there that day; he said the pilot got a “green deck” before landing. He described the flight as normal and the pilot made two passes around the rig before landing on the Ensco 99 helipad. The passenger said he and the pilot did not discuss which helipad to land on. The passenger said that he had flown to/from ST67B about 2 to 3 times a month prior to the accident and never had a pilot try to land on the ST67B helipad. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nIn interviews with other PHI INC pilots based in Grand Isle, none of them recalled having a conversation with the accident pilot about the ST67B helipad. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter was a Bell 206-L4, serial number 52038. An FAA inspector performed a review of the maintenance records, which revealed that all required inspections had been completed by the operator. No discrepancies were noted.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWeather at  Fourchon, Louisiana (K9F2), approximately 15 miles north of ST67B, at 1700, was reported as wind from 240 degrees at 12 knots, visibility 7 miles, few clouds 3,000 feet, temperature 32 degrees Celsius, dewpoint 25 degrees Celsius, and an altimeter setting of 29.87 inches of Mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHELIPAD INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the height above the ST67B helipad to the bottom of the Ensco 99’s oil derrick was approximately 30 to 35 feet.  According to Energy XX1, the ST67B helipad was closed due to this encroachment, but at the time of the accident there were no markings on the helipad that denoted it as closed. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nEnergy XX1 reported that when the Ensco 99 mated with the ST67B in January 2012, a tarp with a red “X” was placed over the ST67B helipad.  At some point, the tarp blew away or “disappeared.”  Then an “X” was made on the helipad with red tape, and that too disappeared.  Energy XX1 did not know the when the tarp or tape were placed on the ST67B helipad. However, the day after the accident, a red “X” was painted on the ST67B helipad.  &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nAccording to PHI INC, a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) declaring the ST67B helipad \"closed\" was not issued prior to the accident.  As a result of the accident, they issued a company NOTAM on May 29, 2012, declaring the ST67B helipad closed. &#x0D;\n &#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter wreckage was recovered several hours after the accident and transported to PHI INC’s facility in Lafayette. The wreckage was examined on May 30, 2012, under the supervision of the NTSB investigator-in-charge.  In addition to salt- water damage, the helicopter sustained impact damage on the left side of the nose and along the left side of the fuselage. The roof of the fuselage was partially crushed into the cabin and the skids were spread.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe tail boom had separated from the fuselage at the point where the tail boom attached to the fuselage. The tail boom exhibited minor damage. The tail rotor assembly and both blades were not damaged; however, the main rotor blades exhibited impact damage and were fragmented. Both main rotor blades remained attached to the mast, but only about four feet of each blade remained. The missing pieces of the main rotor blades were not recovered. Flight control continuity was established for all flight controls to the cockpit. Examination of the airframe found no mechanical discrepancies that would have contributed to the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nExamination of the engine found no obvious mechanical discrepancies that would have contributed to a loss of engine power.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn autopsy was conducted on the pilot on May 29, 2012, by the Jefferson Parish Forensic Center, in Harvey, Louisiana. The cause of death was determined to be asphyxia due to drowning and multiple blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicological testing was conducted by the FAA Toxicology Accident Research Laboratory, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  The tests were negative for all items tested.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSURVIVAL ASPECTS&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to information provided by the company that recovered the helicopter, the pilot was found inside the cockpit of the helicopter with his seatbelt/shoulder harness assembly unfastened.&#x0D;\nExamination of the helicopter revealed that the pilot’s seat (front right) was intact and no visible damage was noted to the seat frame or box. The front right door was not damaged and functioned normally when tested. The pilot's 4-point seatbelt/shoulder harness assembly was intact and both the lap belt buckle and inertial reel system worked when manually tested. The pilot was wearing his company issued life vest and the two bladders were found outside of their vest pockets. The vest had two bladders that could be inflated manually by pulling down on two pull-tabs on the front of the vest (one for each bladder). When the tab is pulled it activates a carbon dioxide cartridge. Once the cartridge is activated, a red locking pin built into the system is sheared. Examination of the cartridge on the left side of the pilot's vest (which feeds the front bladder) revealed that the red locking pin was sheared and the cartridge had been activated. Examination of the front bladder revealed a 3-inch-long diagonal tear on the front left side of the bladder. The tear appeared to have been made with a sharp object and it was later determined that the bladder was cut by rescue personnel to help extricate the pilot from the helicopter.  The seams of the bladder were inspected and no other tears/leaks were noted. Examination of the red locking pin on the right cartridge assembly (which feeds the rear bladder) revealed it was intact and the cartridge had not been activated. No tears or leaks were observed in the rear bladder. The cartridge was then activated and the bladder filled immediately with air. The helicopter’s emergency external float system was intact.  The system was manually activated from the cockpit during the wreckage examination, and all but the middle float on the right rear fully expanded.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEnergy XXI contracted PHI INC to transport their employees and contractors. Flights were conducted out of PHI’s base in Grand Isle, Louisiana. Based on interviews conducted with PHI INC pilots based in Grand Isle, it was learned that the oil derrick’s position over the ST67B helipad was a known safety hazard. However, the hazard was never brought to the attention of PHI INC management based in Grand Isle or via the company’s internal safety reporting system. According to one pilot based in Grand Isle, he said he had landed on the ST76B helipad on April 17, 2012, at the request of his passenger, an Energy XX1 employee. At that time, the oil derrick was extended only 4-feet over the helipad. It was moved three more feet over the pad the following day on April 18, 2012. Though the pilot said he was legal to land on the ST67B helipad per his operations manual, he felt it was unsafe to operate from that helipad due to the confined space.  The pilot said that when he returned to Grand Isle, he told an administrative assistant about the hazard versus the base’s lead pilot because, “A lead pilot was not on duty that week.”  The pilot said an administrative assistant called the platform and told them the ST67B platform was too dangerous to land on and should be closed.  The assistant then put up a memo in the pilot’s lounge stating the ST67B helipad was closed.  The pilot said he was aware of PHI INC’s internal safety notification process since it was part of his initial training.  But, with all the other information they had to absorb in training “that info went out the window.”  The pilot did not recall if he had any conversations with the accident pilot about landing on the ST67B helipad. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe passenger on the April 17th flight stated that he did not recall ever landing on the ST67B helipad that day or ever making a request to land there.  The passenger said he has always landed on the Ensco 99 helipad and has never had a pilot ask him which helipad he wanted to land on.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the Grand Isle base’s weekly safety meeting notes from January 2012 (when the Ensco 99 mated with the ST67B platform) to the date of the accident revealed there was no mention about the ST67B helipad being closed or a hazard.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of the Master Service Agreement between PHI INC and Energy XX1 revealed there were no requirements for Energy XXI to inform PHI that the ST67B helipad was closed or to tell PHI INC how to conduct their flight operations. According to Energy XX1, they relied on pilots to use their best “professional judgment” to avoid hazards. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Ensco 99 was staffed with a rig clerk, whose duties included coordinating transportation for Energy XXI and Ensco employees to and from the rig. In an interview, the rig clerk stated that one of PHI INC‘s administrative assistant from the Grand Isle base contacted him on the day of the accident via the telephone to verify that the accident pilot had a “green deck” prior to landing.  He didn’t recall if the assistant specified which helipad the green deck was for, but he assumed it was for the Ensco 99 helipad since that was the only helipad he gave a “green deck” to. The rig clerk confirmed the “green deck” and was told the pilot was 20 minutes out from landing.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA review of PHI INC’s flight manifest records for the accident flight revealed that ST67B was the designated location, not Ensco 99. This was observed on other PHI INC flight manifest records as well.  In an interview, the supervisor of the passenger scheduled to be picked up on the day of the accident, stated that he sent the transport request to PHI INC on the morning of the accident. When asked if he specifically requested that his employee be picked up at the ST67B helipad.  He said, “No, the ST67B pad was out of service. However, when we make the request to PHI for a pilot to pick us up here, they know it’s for the Ensco 99 helideck.”  The supervisor said that he had not seen or read anything that stated the ST67B pad was closed, and it was just an assumption since flights were always made to/from the Ensco 99 helipad.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to PHI INC’s FAA accepted Operations Manual revealed there were no restrictions or limitations that would have prevented the pilot from landing on the ST67B helipad. -",

    "AnalysisNarrative": "The single-main-rotor helicopter was dispatched on a search and rescue (SAR) mission in response to a snowmobile accident in remote, mountainous terrain. The helicopter was on lease to the local sheriff's office, and was being flown by the chief pilot of the company that owned it. Two SAR personnel were passengers. After an initial but fruitless search to locate the snowmobile victim, the helicopter located members of the snowmobile party. After a landing and brief discussion with the snowmobilers, they agreed to lead the helicopter to the accident site on their snowmobiles. The helicopter lifted off to follow the snowmobilers, flying about 100 to 200 feet above the trees. Because the helicopter was faster than the snowmobiles, the pilot stopped several times in a hover to allow the snowmobiles to catch up. During one hover, the pilot experienced a slight left yaw, which he believed he corrected. The helicopter then began to spin rapidly and descended into the trees. The sheriff's office dispatchers used a commercial flight following system to track the helicopter, but system difficulties prevented them from detecting the accident via that system. The injured pilot climbed a nearby hill, and notified the dispatchers of the accident via radio. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe recovered wreckage was examined, and no evidence of any preimpact deficiencies or failures that would have prevented normal operation and continued flight was discovered. Data recovered from the engine control unit indicated that the engine operated normally until the accident, when parameter exceedances and torque spikes, consistent with main rotor blade strikes, were recorded. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe directional control actuator (DCA), which was the hydro-mechanical unit used to control the tail rotor, was removed and sent to the helicopter manufacturer for testing and examination. The DCA passed the functional checks, and no evidence of any anomalies that would have prevented normal operation was detected. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nA damaged tree near a trail sign in the search area suggested the possibility that the tail rotor might have struck the tree and been damaged just before the accident. However, examination of the damage to the tree and the tail rotor did not support that hypothesis. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSingle-main-rotor helicopters are susceptible to a phenomenon known as \"loss of tail rotor effectiveness\" (LTE), which can occur at low airspeeds, and is a function of relative wind direction. The loss of control occurred in a hover, but the relative wind direction could not be determined. LTE is more likely at high density altitude and/or gross weight. The accident occurred at a density altitude of about 9,000 feet, and at a weight about 800 pounds below the maximum certificated operating weight. In the accident helicopter, LTE would result in a nose-right spin direction. Both the pilot and surviving passenger recalled that the spin direction was nose left, which is contrary to LTE. However, neither was certain of the spin direction, and a ground witness reported that the spin direction was nose right, consistent with LTE. Examination of the wreckage did not provide conclusive evidence as to the direction of the spin, but did indicate that both the main and tail rotor were rotating under power at the time of impact. Based on the witness observation and the uncertainty of the helicopter occupants about the direction of spin, the high density altitude, and the lack of indications of a tail rotor mechanical failure, it is likely that the loss of control was due to LTE.",
    "FactualNarrative": "HISTORY OF FLIGHT On February 15, 2012, about 1301 mountain standard time, a Bell Helicopter model 407, N407HL, was substantially damaged when it impacted trees and terrain in the Bridger Teton National Forest near Moran Junction, Wyoming, during a search and rescue (SAR) mission. The commercial pilot and one SAR crewmember received serious injuries, and the other SAR crewmember received fatal injuries. The public-use flight was operated by the Teton County Sheriff's Office (TCSO). Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flight plan was filed for the flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe mission was in response to a reported snowmobile injury accident, in order to transport medical personnel to that scene. Initial attempts to locate that victim, based on trail network and geographic coordinate information, were unsuccessful. The helicopter began a search, and the crew observed two snowmobilers signaling to them in a meadow. The helicopter landed in the meadow, and a SAR member exited and spoke with the snowmobilers. They were from the victim's party, and they agreed to lead the helicopter on their snowmobiles to the accident site. The SAR member re-boarded the helicopter, the helicopter lifted off to follow the snowmobilers, flying about 100 to 200 feet above the trees. Since the helicopter was faster than the snowmobiles, the pilot stopped two or three times in a hover to allow the snowmobiles to catch up. On either the second or third hover, the pilot experienced a slight left yaw, which he believed he corrected. The helicopter then started \"spinning rapidly\" and descended into the trees. The pilot and the surviving SAR member both believed that the spin direction was nose left, but they were not certain. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe SAR member in the rear seat remained conscious throughout the event, and extricated himself, despite an injured leg. He assisted the other SAR member and the pilot out of the helicopter after they became verbally responsive. The pilot carried a radio to the top of a nearby ridge and requested assistance. Reports varied as to when the first ground personnel who were originally responding to the snowmobile accident arrived at the helicopter, but the first TCSO personnel reached the helicopter about 1622. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL INFORMATION &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) information indicated that the pilot held multiple certificates and ratings, including a commercial pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. The pilot reported a total flight experience of about 22,250 hours, including about 4,500 hours in the accident helicopter make and model. His most recent FAA second-class medical certificate was issued in May 2011. He was the chief pilot for Hillsboro Aviation, Hillsboro, Oregon. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to FAA information, the helicopter was manufactured in 2008 and was equipped with a Rolls Royce 250-C47 series turboshaft engine. The helicopter was registered to Hillsboro Aviation, leased to TCSO, and operated by Hillsboro flight personnel. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAt the time of the accident, the helicopter had accumulated a total time in service of 828.6 hours. The operator cited the maximum allowable gross weight of the helicopter as 5,250 pounds, which agreed with the FAA type certificate value when the helicopter was equipped with kit 407-706-020. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe 1251 automated weather observation for the departure location, Jackson Hole Airport (JAC), Jackson, Wyoming, located about 25 miles southwest of the accident site, included winds from 090 degrees at 4 knots, visibility 10 miles, few clouds at 4,500 feet, temperature -6 degrees C, dew point -9 degrees C, and an altimeter setting of 29.96 inches of mercury. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAdditional relevant meteorological information obtained from a variety of sources, indicated that the entire region, including the accident locale, was dominated by a high pressure region. This resulted in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) conditions, with no or high ceilings, and generally easterly winds of 10 knots or less. The density altitude was calculated to be between 8,500 and 9,300 feet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSite Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was in a partially forested area, with coordinates of 43.726 degrees N, 110.217 degrees W. Site elevation was approximately 9,550 feet above mean sea level (msl). The ground in the immediate vicinity of the wreckage was relatively flat but sloped, the terrain in the general locale of the accident site was uneven, and the overall region was mountainous wilderness. The entire region was snow-covered, and the ground in the immediate vicinity of the wreckage was under deep snow. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWreckage Overview&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe helicopter came to rest on its right side in a stand of evergreen trees approximately 80 -100 feet high. One of those trees bore a diagonal cut, which separated its top, about 50 feet above the ground. The tree had a diameter of approximately 1 foot at that location. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nReview of on-scene photographs revealed the following information. The fuselage (cockpit and cabin) was essentially intact, with minimal intrusions into, or compromises of, the occupiable volume. All cabin doors remained attached and operable, but damaged. Of the ten cabin transparencies, only the one for the aft left door was intact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAll four main rotor blades (MRB) were fracture-separated from the rotor mast/hub. The tail boom was fracture-separated into several sections, but damage precluded determination of the spin direction. The empennage, which consisted of the aft vertical fin, tail rotor gearbox, and tail rotor, was fracture-separated from the tail boom. The two tail rotor blades remained attached to the tail rotor hub, which remained attached to the gearbox. The engine remained intact and attached to the airframe. There was no fire. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWreckage Examination &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe wreckage was recovered from the accident site by helicopter on February 24, 2012. Some minor sectioning and/or disassembly of the wreckage was necessary for recovery purposes. The wreckage was examined by investigators and manufacturers' representatives about 1 week after that. Several components or component elements were determined not to have been recovered with the wreckage. These included most afterbody portions of the MRBs, a short tip section of one MRB, and an approximate 30-inch segment of the tail boom (just forward of the tail rotor assembly). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nInspection of the engine exterior did not reveal any obvious signs of damage from impact forces or internal engine failure. The engine mounting structure was intact and properly secured, and no evidence of oil or fuel leaks was observed in the engine bay or surrounding area. The N1 and N2 rotor systems rotated smoothly and quietly by hand, and N1 and N2 gear train continuity was confirmed. There was no impact damage, metal splatter or evidence of rubbing around the power turbine air shrouds. Inspection of the inlet plenum chamber did not reveal any evidence of foreign material or missing hardware. Inspection of the compressor inlet revealed no visible damage or signs of foreign object ingestion. Drive continuity from the engine to the main rotor and tail rotor drive was verified. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Engine Control Unit (ECU) was visually undamaged. Extraction of the ECU Incident Recorder (IR) data revealed a total of 15 data-points, recorded at 1.2 second intervals. In addition to IR data, eight additional \"Snapshot\" data lines were recorded in a separate file. Snapshot data is recorded immediately following an engine exceedance. All snapshot data lines were recorded within the final 3 seconds of the accident flight. Examination of ECU IR data recorded during the accident sequence revealed the engine responding normally to control inputs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPhysical examination of the available wreckage did not reveal evidence of any pre-impact deficiencies or failures that would have prevented normal operation and continued flight. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGPS and Flight Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTwo handheld/portable GPS devices were onboard and operational for the entire flight, including the accident. Both were Garmin devices; one was a GPSMap296, and the other was an Aera 500. Both devices were sent to the NTSB Recorders laboratory for data download. Data from the accident flight was successfully recovered from both devices, and the flight tracks from the two devices were congruent.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe departure from Jackson, Wyoming, occurred about 1225. The en route portion of the flight to the search area ended about 1241. The en route groundspeed was about 115 knots, with altitudes ranging from about 8,976 feet MSL to 9,823 feet MSL. Upon entering the search area, the helicopter proceeded southeasterly for about 2 minutes. It then tracked southwesterly, made a 360-degree turn and then proceeded north-northwest until about 1249.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nBased on crewmember testimony and geographic information, the northwest-most excursion corresponded to the point in the flight where the crew hovered to read a trail sign in order to obtain orientation/location information. After reading the trail sign, they then headed southeast again. That southeast leg extended about 2.2 miles farther southeast than the prior legs. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAbout 1254, the helicopter landed and a crewmember exited to speak with uninjured snowmobilers associated with the individual to be rescued. During that ground discussion it was agreed that the snowmobilers would lead the helicopter to the snowmobile victim.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe last segment of the flight, including the accident, occurred between 1300:24 and 1301:53. The groundspeed decreased from about 25 knots to less than 15 knots while at an altitude of about 9,680 feet MSL. The helicopter impacted trees and the ground about 1301:53. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDamaged Tree &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe possibility that the TR struck a small tree during the crew's hovering maneuver to read the trail sign was prompted by the finding of a small tree near that sign whose top was observed to be damaged. GPS track data confirmed that the helicopter had transited and loitered near the tree and trail sign. The GPS data did not indicate that the helicopter hovered in the immediate vicinity of the tree. The tree was a few hundred feet away from the sign, and the sign was oriented so that when reading the sign, the sign would be positioned between the reader and the tree. The upper 3-4 feet of the tree was sectioned from the tree by recovery personnel and returned with the helicopter wreckage, and was examined concurrent with the helicopter examination. The broken branch was about 3/4 inch in diameter, and the branch material was soft and flexible. No other branches from the recovered sample were observed to be broken or missing. The aggregate evidence was consistent with the branch not being struck or broken by the helicopter or the TR.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nCommercial Tracking Services Company&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nGuardian Mobility was a private company based in Canada, which provided a variety of aviation services. At the time of the accident, the TCSO and the accident helicopter were equipped for and utilizing the company's \"Automatic Flight Following\" (AFF) tracking service.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nUse of AFF services requires that the aircraft be physically equipped with a GPS-based tracking device, and that the aircraft operator have an active contract with company for the AFF services. Conceptually, the tracking device uploads the current aircraft position, altitude and average speed via satellite every 2 minutes, that information is processed by company software, and then operators can access and monitor that company-provided real-time tracking information via the internet. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to a TCSO dispatch supervisor, they used the AFF system as a tool to track their aviation resources. Access to the system is installed on a server within the TCSO and available to all dispatchers in the TCSO Communications Center. The tracking system itself is passive with regard to incident or accident notification. The TCSO personnel first have to access and/or log onto the system on their computers, and then they must actively monitor the system display, which depicts certain aircraft parameters. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the manager of the Teton Interagency Dispatch Center, AFF does not provide alerts to dispatchers. Aircraft are depicted on the screen in blue if they are active, and in red if they have lost communication. Communication loss could be due to several factors, including operation in a location with poor or no satellite communication, or an incident/accident. The flight follower/dispatcher would not receive an alert, they would have to notice that the aircraft symbol on the screen turned red. Both of the TSCO dispatchers who were monitoring the flight reported that the AFF system did not change the color of the helicopter screen symbol until well after they knew about the accident, despite their repeated queries of the system; the AFF system was not instrumental in alerting the dispatchers to the loss of the helicopter. Subsequent to the accident, for unspecified reasons, the AFF system was upgraded to a newer version with improved functionality.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nDirectional Control Actuator (DCA) Test and Examination&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Directional Control Actuator (DCA), which was the hydro-mechanical unit used to control the TR, was removed and sent to Bell Helicopter for testing and examination. The DCA passed the functional checks and no evidence of any anomalies which would have prevented normal operation was detected. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nHover Performance Information&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAn Allowable Payload chart was found in the helicopter, in a binder identified as a Teton County SAR (TCSAR) medical protocols document. According to TCSAR personnel the chart was developed by the pilot, and was never used by the TCSAR personnel. TCSAR was uncertain as to why the chart was in that binder.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe chart contained two tables, one for \"HIGE\" (hover in ground effect), and one for \"HOGE\" (hover out of ground effect). The tables presented the maximum allowable payload (in pounds) as a function of pressure altitude (PA) and ambient temperature. Comparison of the chart with helicopter manufacturer's performance data validated the accuracy of the chart. Calculations using the available information indicated that the departure weight was approximately 4,165 to 4,300 lbs, and the weight at the time of the accident was between 3,965 and 4,100 lbs.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nComparison of known meteorological conditions and the estimated flight weight with the chart performance data indicated that the helicopter was within its hover performance envelope at the time of the accident.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLoss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness (LTE)&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFAA Advisory Circular (AC) 90-95, Unanticipated Right Yaw In Helicopters, addressed the topic of loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE). The AC stated that LTE has been determined to be a contributing factor in a number of helicopter accidents. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AC continued with the following text:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLTE is a critical, low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic which can result in an uncommanded rapid yaw rate which does not subside of its own accord and, if not corrected, can result in the loss of aircraft control. LTE is not related to a maintenance malfunction and may occur in single-main-rotor helicopters at airspeeds less than 30 knots. LTE is not necessarily the result of a control margin deficiency. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nFlight operations at low altitude and low airspeed in which the pilot is distracted from the dynamic conditions affecting control of the helicopter are particularly susceptible to the LTE phenomena.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOn U.S. manufactured single rotor helicopters [such as the accident helicopter], the main rotor rotates counterclockwise as viewed from above. The torque produced by the main rotor causes the fuselage of the aircraft to rotate in the opposite direction (nose right). The anti-torque system provides thrust which counteracts this torque and provides directional control while hovering&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAny maneuver which requires the pilot to operate in a high-power, low-airspeed environment with a left crosswind or tailwind creates an environment where unanticipated right yaw may occur. There is greater susceptibility for LTE in right turns. This is especially true during flight at low airspeed since the pilot may not be able to stop rotation. The helicopter will attempt to yaw to the right. Correct and timely pilot response to an uncommanded right yaw is critical. The yaw is usually correctable if additional left pedal is applied immediately. If the response is incorrect or slow, the yaw rate may rapidly increase to a point where recovery is not possible&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe AC also noted that certain factors affect susceptibility to LTE. Relevant to this accident are gross weight, density altitude, and low airspeed. An increase in weight or density altitude will decrease the power margin between the maximum power available and the power required to hover. The pilot should conduct low-level, low-airspeed maneuvers with minimum weight. At airspeeds below translational lift, the tail rotor is required to produce nearly 100 percent of the directional control. If the required amount of tail rotor thrust is not available for any reason, the aircraft will yaw to the right. -",

The helicopter was registered to and operated by CENAC Marine Services, LLC, Houma, Louisiana, under the provisions of 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 as a personal flight. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident, and no flight plan had been filed. The local flight originated from Houma (KHUM), Louisiana, at 0827.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSeveral witnesses told St. Mary’s Parish sheriff’s deputies that they saw the helicopter circling at a low altitude. They said the left seat pilot waved at them. None of the witnesses saw the impact, but heard the impact and saw smoke. They responded to the site and used portable fire extinguishers to extinguish the fire.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPERSONNEL (CREW) INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAccording to the helicopter owner/operator the pilot-in-command, age 40, was seated in the left seat. He held an airline transport pilot certificate with airplane multiengine land rating, commercial pilot privileges with airplane single-engine land and rotorcraft-helicopter ratings, and a flight instructor certificate with airplane single/multiengine and instrument ratings. He was type rated in the Beech 300/350 King Air, Hawker Beechjet 400, Cessna 500 Citation, and the Mitsubishi MU-300 Diamond. He held a first class airman medical certificated, dated June 24, 2011, with no restrictions or limitations. According to his employer, the pilot had logged 8,700 total flight hours and 260 hours in the Robinson R44, of which 215 hours were as pilot-in-command. His list flight review was accomplished in the Beech 350 King Air on December 6, 2011.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe second pilot, age 43, was seated in the right seat. He held a private pilot certificate with a rotorcraft-helicopter rating. He also held a third class airman medical certificate, dated April 15, 2010, with the restriction that he wear corrective lenses while exercising the privileges of his airman certificate. According to his employer, the pilot had logged 450 total flight hours, the majority of which was in the Bell 47 helicopter. He had logged 18.9 hours in the Robinson R44, his last flight being on May 5, 2011. He had also flown the Brantley helicopter.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAIRCRAFT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nN369TL (serial number 11055), a model R44 II, was manufactured by the Robinson Helicopter Company on January 16, 2006. It was powered by a Lycoming IO-540-AE1A5 engine (serial number L-30804-48A), rated at 300 horsepower. According the helicopter maintenance records, the last 100-hour/annual inspection was performed on March 31, 2011, at a total time of 461.5 hours. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMETEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe following METARs (Aviation Routine Weather Report) were recorded at Houma (KHUM) and Patterson (KPTN), Louisiana:&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nKHUM 0850: Wind, 020 degrees at 3 knots; visibility, 6 miles, mist; ceiling, 1,800 feet broken; temperature,  12 degrees Celsius (C.); dew point, 11 degrees C.; altimeter, 30.15 inches of Mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nKPTN 0855: Wind, 070 degrees at 3 knots; visibility, 10 miles; ceiling, 2,400 feet overcast; temperature, 12 degrees C.; dew point, 11 degrees C.; altimeter, 30.14 inches of Mercury.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWRECKAGE AND IMPACT INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe accident site was situated at an elevation of 6 feet msl (above mean sea level), encompassing a perimeter of about 500 feet. The on-scene investigation revealed the helicopter struck several trees and fell straight to the ground in a nose-low attitude, coming to rest on its right side. A post-impact fire ensued. The tail boom and tail rotor blades remained attached to the helicopter, and 3-foot stubs of the main rotor blades remained attached. The tail rotor drive shaft was intact and, when turned by hand, continuity was observed. Nearby was a 2-foot gash deep in the ground, about the length of a main rotor blade. The helicopter sustained extensive thermal damage from the tail boom forward. All control rods and linkages remained attached to the rotor hub. All breaks were consistent with overload fractures.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe instrument panel was destroyed, but the vertical speed indicator registered 2,600 feet per minute descent, and the attitude indicator revealed a 35-degree left turn and nose-down attitude.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nImpact signatures were consistent with the helicopter in a steep descent and the engine operating at the time of impact.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMEDICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nAutopsies were performed on both pilots by the Louisiana Forensic Center. According to their reports, both pilots succumbed to blunt force injuries.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nToxicology protocols were conducted by FAA’s Civil Aeromedical Institute (CAMI). According to their reports, none of the pilot’s specimens were suitable for analysis due to putrefaction. The pilot-rated passenger had no carbon monoxide, cyanide or ethanol in the blood (cavity)`, but amlodipine, pravastatin, and valsartan were detected in the liver and blood (cavity). According to FAA’s Forensic Toxicology Drug Information website, amlodipine (Norvasc®) is a prescription calcium channel blocker medication used to treat high blood pressure and angina, pravastatin (Pravachol®) is a prescription HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor to reduce cholesterol biosynthesis and treat elevated blood lipids, and valsartan (Diovan®) is a prescription angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) that acts on the AT1 receptor subtype and is used to control high blood pressure.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nTESTS AND RESEARCH&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe engine was examined at Air Salvage of Dallas in Lancaster, Texas, under the auspices of the National Transportation Safety Board. Examination revealed that the intake and exhaust valves were seized due to thermal damage to the engine. There were no pre-impact anomalies with the engine which would have precluded normal operation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe three servos were examined at the Robinson Helicopter Company under the auspices of the National Transportation Safety Board. Thermal damaged had compromised most of the servo seals. No foreign debris, scoring, or witness marks were observed on either spool or metering edges of the sleeve.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector who participated in the investigation, a former U.S. Army helicopter pilot and an FAA helicopter pilot examiner, submitted a written statement in which he noted what appeared to be a high velocity impact, large grooves in the ground indicating engine power at impact, and a near vertical descent consistent with “settling with power.”&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe following is based on FAA’s “Helicopter Flying Handbook,” (FAA-H-8083-21, Chapter 11, p. 11-13):&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n “Vortex ring state” is an aerodynamic condition in which a helicopter may be in a vertical descent with 20 percent up to maximum power applied, and little or no climb performance. “Settling with power” occurs when the helicopter keeps settling even though full engine power is applied. Main rotor tip vortices generate drag and degrade airfoil efficiency. As long as the tip vortices are small, their only effect is a small loss in main rotor efficiency. However, when the helicopter begins to descend vertically, it settles into its own downwash, which greatly enlarges the tip vortices. In this vortex ring state, most of the power developed by the engine is wasted in circulating the air in a doughnut pattern around the rotor. A vortex ring state may be entered during any maneuver that places the main rotor in a condition of descending in a column of disturbed air and low forward airspeed. Airspeeds that are below translational lift airspeeds are within this region of susceptibility to settling with power aerodynamics. This condition is sometimes seen during quick-stop type maneuvers or during recovery from autorotation. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSome of the situations that are conducive to a settling with power condition are hovering above ground effect altitude, specifically attempting to hover out of ground effect (OGE) at altitudes above the hovering ceiling of the helicopter, attempting to hover OGE without maintaining precise altitude control, pinnacle or rooftop helipads when the wind is not aligned with the landing direction, and downwind and steep power approaches in which airspeed is permitted to drop below 10 knots, depending on the type of helicopter. -",
